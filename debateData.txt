Thanks, Bob. All right, Bob. So normally I -- the question is why are we doing this debate now? And that's pretty obvious, so I'm going to move in a different direction somewhat tonight. Since we're doing a debate about -- essentially about health insurance, as it turns out insurance is your business.

Robert Rosenkranz Okay. Let me start with an analogy. If you go to buy a car, the car dealer knows exactly what that car cost him and, therefore, can charge you a price that reflects that cost plus profit. When you're buying car insurance, the insurance company does not know how much it's going to cost, how many accidents you might have or what the cost is fixing them. So the insurance company is setting a price tag, but they have to make an intelligent guess about what their future losses are going to be. And in the case of car insurance, for example, an intelligent guess is that young drivers are going to have more accidents, that cars that are poorly maintained are going to have more accidents, et cetera, et cetera. And the pricing reflects that. Young drivers pay higher premiums because historically they are not as good at, say, driving. So how does health insurance work in that sense ?

But there are obvious differences. I mean, health insurance is going to cost much more for older people than it costs for younger people. So by having this idea that everybody should be paying the same, you're in effect having young people overpay a lot and older people get a great bargain.

What is that?

And a group of sick people is going to have a very different experience than a group of well people. So as an insurance company you're providing insurance for individuals, you have to be sure or at least have a good reason to think that the individuals who show up to sign up for this insurance are a representative sample, that you're not just getting the bad risks. And that's why, for example, this idea of preexisting conditions, which sounds kind of cruel, that insurance companies would evaluate coverage for my preexisting condition. But if they didn't have that rule, nobody would buy health insurance except when they get sick and then they rush to buy it. So taking that idea to the rollout here of Obamacare, part of the implication of difficulties of signing up is that the people who are most motivated, mainly older and sicker people, will run that gauntlet. The people who need the insurance less are finding it overpriced, like young healthy people, will not go to that trouble. And that's what's meant by adverse selection. And if I were the insurance companies on these exchanges I would be very worried about that right now.

And you've given us some good 101 basics to help understand it. Thank you very much, Bob Rosenkranz. And let's bring our debaters to the stage. So several times throughout the evening I'm going to again for the sake of the radio broadcast request your entirely spontaneous applause. And this is one of those times, but I'd actually like to make it a round of applause, again, for Bob Rosenkranz for bringing this to us.
Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|10|R1|JOHN DONVAN|moderator|1|14|5|0|0|22|0|24|0|0|2|0|30|15|0|0|5|0|0|3|0|154|1|0|1|0|1|2|14|0|0|1|17|0|1|5|0|0|0|5|4|7|5|19|28|27|38|5|41|0|0|5|0|0|25|20|0|5|0|14|32|9|0|8|15|267|Sometimes a glitch is just a glitch. Your computer program locks up. You close it down again. You open it up again, and you move on because it was just a glitch. So the president's health insurance program, the Affordable Care Act, launches fall 2013 with some problems, problems with the software, problems with deadlines, problems with public expectations. So what are those? Are those just glitches or are we, as some have argued, actually looking at the blue screen of death for Obamacare? Well, that sounds like a debate. So let's have it, "Yes," or, "No," to this statement, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue," a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., I'm John Donvan. We are at the Kaufman Music Center in New York, and we have four superbly qualified debaters, two teams of two, who will take opposite sides on this motion, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " As always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. Our motion, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue," let's meet the team arguing for that motion. First, ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Scott, you have been a practicing physician, you're a former FDA deputy commissioner, you have said in the past that Obamacare is looking more and more like Medicaid, which is an interesting comment because during the Bush administration you were actually a senior advisor to the Medicaid program. So what we're trying to understand is when you say that Obamacare is looking more like Medicaid, is that a compliment or the reverse?

Megan McArdle, ladies and gentlemen. Our motion is, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " We have two debaters arguing against this motion. First, let's welcome, ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Chait. Jonathan, you are a daily columnist at New Yorker magazine. You write political commentary for its website and also for the print magazine. You have written on numerous occasions, you've made this point that the law that President Obama eventually signed off on is essentially based on a moderate Republican health care plan. And you used Romneycare as an example of that. So if that is true, what explains why the Republican party is now so vociferously against Obamacare?

They're not policy wonks, and when Mitt Romney said he was for it, it sounded like a good solid Republican idea. When Barack Obama said he was for it, then it became a Socialist plot to destroy America. And if you don't know what's in the law, that's a pretty sensible way to think about what the law does.

And, Doug, you are also arguing against this motion, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " You are a family doctor. You're a specialist in preventive medicine. You spent 20 years in the U.S. Public Health Service, working on a range of issues, clinical research policy, and reached the rank of assistant surgeon general. You have a book a while back, Dissecting American Health Care," and you started your chapter on health care reform by saying, quote, "Health is a blessing that money cannot buy.

And let's welcome our four debaters. Now, this is a debate. It's a contest, a contest of wits, and logic, and humor, and ideas, and insight. It's competition, and by the time the debate has ended, we will have one side winning and one side losing and that is determined by a vote of you, our live audience, here in New York. We have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of the evening will be declared our winner. So let's go to our preliminary vote. Go to those keypads at your seat. We're going to register you -- we're going to register your opening positions as members of this audience on this motion: Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. If you agree with that statement, push number one. If you disagree, push number two, and if you're undecided, push number three. I see a lot of people staring at the graphic on the screen as they push the button. That is not meant to be a subliminal suggestion. It's meant only to be provocative, but not to sway your vote. All right. So we're going to lock out the votes, and I'll remind you again. After the arguments, which go three rounds, we will have you vote a second time and we'll very quickly get the results and find out who, in your view, won this debate.

Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|24|R2|SCOTT GOTTLIEB|for|19|59|21|1|0|101|0|76|0|0|7|4|124|53|1|7|18|4|0|0|0|603|8|0|0|6|0|3|38|0|0|8|73|4|5|16|11|3|1|8|16|3|14|25|165|79|104|28|137|0|1|3|0|1|47|77|0|21|6|29|112|4|12|9|65|1098|When it comes to Obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well beyond the internet. Theyre imbedded in the structure of the law and theyll become more acute as this scheme unfolds. Obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts that turn the proposals against the legislations own laudible goals. Simply put, its a plan at war with its own ambitions. And tonight I want to briefly address some of the paradoxes embedded in this law. First, Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive. A big reason is provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around hospitals. Having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care, and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals. We've basically built in a subsidy of that excess capacity. And we also know that there's ample evidence that when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospital-owned systems, productivity falls. And when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices. Second, the law seeks to increase competition between insurers its partly seen as a way to lower costs, but Obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and leave you with fewer choices. For one thing, Obamacare taps the operating margins of health plans. This basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the expense of new start-ups and new entrants. Obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package. The result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they can choose from. Go on the website and take a look for yourself and I'm putting out some data on this next week. If you look at the health plans that insurance companies sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the same. It doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum plan. By buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your co-pays and deductibles. In other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your out-of-pocket costs. There is no competition between these plans based on benefits or networks. There is no real choice in these exchanges. Third, Obamacare is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured who get coverage under this scheme will end up on Medicaid. And so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the Obamacare exchanges? They're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the individual or small-group markets and got moved into Obamacare, some of them forcibly. But don't take my word for this. Look at the numbers being put out by the administration. The White House says that 19 million people will be added to Medicaid. That's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people will get Obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four million. But we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to conform. And as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year -- Obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies. And so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even after the subsidies, to buy that coverage. That's $5,000 a month. And they're getting a plan with a $3,000 deductible. The problem is that's not a good plan for that family. And the problem is that these plans were designed in Washington to meet political aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed. And think about this. There were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when President Obama took office. This year, there were 48 million uninsured Americans. The only way the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured Americans than when his term began is by obligating more people to Medicaid. Obamacare is really a Medicaid law. And so, it begs the question, what about Medicaid? There is now ample evidence in the clinical literature that people on Medicaid are experiencing worse health outcomes than people in other insurance schemes. And sometimes even in the uninsured. Simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the Medicaid program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper. I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes. This doesn't seem moral. Yet Obamacare does almost nothing to fix that Medicaid. It just pushes more people to an already failing system. In many ways, these problems that plague Medicaid will also plague Obamacare. Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid. And Obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered. And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the Obamacare plans. This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard. Obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system. There's no question about that. But it makes things worse. It reduces choice and competition in health plans. It increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine. And finally, it only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a Medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health. In all of these ways, Obamacare works again its own laudable intentions. There are far better ways to address issues of the uninsured in this country and far better ways to address the issues of those who are priced out of the insurance market. For all these reasons and more, Obamacare is now beyond rescue. Thanks a lot.

The motion that you've heard is "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. What you heard Dr. Gottlieb argue is not that it's beyond rescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law. What we're here to discuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed. And the proposed was either Obamacare is now beyond rescue -- meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do - - or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do. My partner, Jonathan Chait, and I will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn't need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working. And to understand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the law was passed and what the goals of the law were. I'll cover that. And Jonathan will also discuss the achievements of Obamacare. But he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard many from the opponents of the law. Speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back to some of the ones we heard. But there are a few, I think, that we'll have to deal with sooner rather than later. Let me first turn to the question about Obamacare and what it does. It's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and quality improvements as well. I want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the question occurs, why is health insurance important? There are a lot of studies that show a lot of reasons for it. Some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less likely to miss their shots. And if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to miss them. Healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other preventive services that they need. People who have diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly. They tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, they tend to be more severe. But just as important in terms of outcomes besides health, people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by it in this system that we had until very recently. This led a group at the Institute of Medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless illness, needless suffering, and needless death. Let's turn the clock back a little bit to 2008, 2009 when this law was being debated. At that time, we had 40 to 45 million people uninsured. We were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and health care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in the developed world. In addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at that time didn't have portability. If you lost your job, you often lost your insurance. You didn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get health insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it. And there were no national standards for insurance policies. We were largely -- not exclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really pushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more you did, the more you got paid. And so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care could've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent. And equally important were the projections -- and this is just now four years ago -- the projections of where we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing had been done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending going from trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000 to average 30,000 a year, Medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in that fee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and not necessarily better. So in March 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedly imperfect law, but not just insurance , quality improvement, cost reductions. What are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of this law? Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies, and three million have. Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage. There's portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it doesn't raise the rates for everybody. No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's evidence based. Also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services they deliver. There are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's discharged and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards. Something called accountable care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and there are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Importantly, cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically. That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent in the past three years, 2010 to 2012. So in summary, before this year, before anything that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of Obamacare. Then we come to October 2013. Everyone knows, what a disaster. Okay? People can't sign up. The computer systems don't work. The website's a mess. There's lots of confusion. Some provisions of the law were postponed. But even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently. Six million enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in Medicaid -- we'll come back to Medicaid -- people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies to help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate . Let me conclude now by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we are now. I want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers, a satirical newspaper called The Onion. The headline was, "Nation Recalls Simpler Time When Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair. " Here's the quote, "Back then, if you couldn't afford health care insurance and got really sick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple," said a Modesto , California, mother of three. "You didn't have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income. People didn't have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went ahead and died of preventable causes. "

Thank you very much. And here's where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this two, arguing it out over this motion, ""Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " You have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. Let's please welcome Megan McArdle. She is a columnist for Bloomberg View and author of the forthcoming book, "The Up Side of Down. " Ladies and gentlemen, Megan McArdle.

But, you know, these debates often tend to sort of devolve into "Who doesn't want people to die? " So that's not actually what's on the table here. The issue is not "Are Democrats Socialists? Are Republicans stupid and venal and terrible people? " The issue is, "Is this law, Obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do? Is it making Americans better off, and can it survive in its current form? " As you listen to the administration, it's impossible for Obamacare to fail because every time they don't hit some number that they've been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success as whatever's already happened. So, for example, just a few months ago, Kathleen Sebelius, who's the secretary of Health and Human Services, was saying that success in the exchanges was seven million people signed up by March 2014. And then they had a few problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn't having seven million people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool -- in the insurance pools on the exchanges. Then they said that we got -- needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults, which is between the ages of 18 and 35. And then we got some data on the demographics. And so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who've signed up are young adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a few reasons that should be fairly obvious, could make insurance cost a lot more than we were hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would be signing up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right, of however many people you've signed up is the number that was possible. It's the self- licking ice cream cone of policy programs. But for the rest of us, I don't think it's enough for Obamacare to merely exist. It has to actually do something and do something that we want. So what did we want? What were we promised? We were promised lower costs for government and individuals, and we've heard some of that. The administration likes to claim that this has already happened. This hasn't. Health care cost growth has indeed slowed, but health care cost growth started slowing in 2004 when Barack Obama was a junior state senator from Illinois. He had not even been elected to the U.S. Senate, much less to the presidency. You see a big decline in 2005 to 2007 -- in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in 2010 right when Obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if you look at the OECD figures on that. Kaiser projects -- you remember we heard that the average family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums? That didn't happen. Kaiser is now projecting that premiums will go up. We wanted people to get healthier as a result of this law, but then we got the Oregon Medicaid Study, which is the gold standard in studies of Medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to look at, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and it showed no statistically significant results. More than half of the expansion in Obamacare comes through Medicaid. We wanted people with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexisting conditions we were told were out there to be able to buy insurance. But when they set up pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting to get 400,000 people between 2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number, and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing an aggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up. And we wanted expanded health care coverage, right? But at this point, we can't even say that there are more people insured right now than there were on January 15, 2013. We -- the administration says that there have been four million people added to Medicaid, but half of those people came in states that didn't even do the Medicaid expansion. So definitionally they were already eligible for Medicaid. Of the other states, some of those people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage. The administration can't even say that these are people who are getting new coverage. Some of them may just be going back on to Medicaid just like they were last year. We have 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policies cancelled. No one, I think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn't even know whether we've increased the insurance numbers and the administration refuses to certify that that is actually happening. Meanwhile, we were not supposed to hurt anyone who had insurance, right? If you liked your plan and you liked your doctor, you could keep them. We all know that that has not happened, so five million people have had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeing that their doctors are not -- the best hospitals and doctors in their area have been kicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges. So, it was also supposed to be really popular, , right? Because we had all of this great stuff, this giant Rube Goldberg apparatus layered on top. We didn't take anything away, we only gave. And it's kind of time for a Dr. Phil moment, how is that working for you? Nothing is working the way the administration said. So you can say it does not really matter whether it is unpopular, right? The point is not to be popular, and yes, some people have gotten hurt, but you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, right? It was never reasonable to think that everyone was going to get to keep the doctors and the plans that they wanted. Something had to change and this is a foundation for something better. But this foundation has so many cracks you cannot build a healthy structure on top of it. Just look at everything the administration has had to do in the last few months just to keep the law running. They had to delay the employer mandate and the enforcement, apparently because they couldnt even figure out how to make this regulation work. It may never go into effect, which means we'll lose millions of people who were supposed to get coverage expanded through and the cost will go up to the government. They delayed the Spanish language website, and now apparently part of it is written in Spanglish. Despite the fact that Hispanics are a major constituency for insurance expansion. They delayed the small business exchanges. They've allowed people to keep plans that were supposed to be illegal because they weren't real insurance Kathleen Sebelius told us. They've delayed deadlines over and over again. They've done all these things by asserting emergency powers by doing administrative fixes through executive fiat, and yeah fair enough, Obamacare is certainly an emergency, but all of these changes have had the effect of undermining and destabilizing the law that they think is so important. Theyve had to do these things even though they know it makes the insurance pools less actuarily sound, because they can't face the political backlash. And what happens when Republicans get into office and I assume they, too, think Obamacare is an emergency and could be fixed with some executive orders. Essentially they've made it so that Republicans can undo two-thirds of this law with a stroke of the presidential pen. Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. The administration has destroyed their own law in order to save it. Thank you.

Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|30|R2|JONATHAN CHAIT|against|13|65|22|0|0|99|0|195|2|0|25|13|223|63|0|19|35|0|0|2|0|901|5|2|7|0|3|4|41|0|1|15|133|0|7|34|37|0|1|7|50|9|20|100|157|193|248|49|142|0|0|2|0|0|154|64|0|29|33|30|267|16|5|32|85|1411|Has anybody here ever renovated a house? I've done it twice. It was hell. Every day I went through brought fresh misery and fresh reason to think why am I doing this, but in the end it worked, and the reason it worked is because we know how to renovate houses, right? So when you hear about the problems that our opponents are describing in the law, they had to delay this, they had to fix this, the Spanish language website didn't work as well as they wanted the first day. You have to ask, are these things that are going to fundamentally destroy the law or are they the kind of problems you have in a renovation? They said, oh, we didn't quite get the counters we want. Oh, this went a little bit over cost. Well, then you have to ask -- to answer that question you have to ask what kind of endeavor is Obamacare? Is the Obama administration trying to build a moon base? Is the Obama administration trying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile Muslim country? No. What they're trying to do is build a national health insurance plan. Can you build a national health insurance plan? Well, every advanced economy in the world, except the United States, has built a national health insurance plan. All of those countries insure all their citizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the United States. So youre a priori assumption has to be yeah, this is something you can basically do that the problems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself, but the problems you have any time you go through any major project. So, what our opponents have been trying to do for months, and months, and months, actually is paint this picture where every time the contractor comes to you and says, "Oh, it turns out they don't have this color, oh, it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day," it means the whole thing is going to collapse on its own. But actually, nothing like that is happening at all. And there is no evidence that anything like this is happening. The main argument that the opponents have been making the entire time is that there is going to be a death spiral. That's the only plausible mechanism that they have, that the law will fail. A death spiral is a term that I expected them to talk about, because that's what they've been talking about for months. It's something they've barely invoked at all. And I think the reason is it's become clear, in recent days, that there's no chance of a death spiral in the Obamacare law. A death spiral is when you have too many old, sick people who drive up the cost, making the premiums more expensive, leading the healthy people to flee, driving up costs more. That is theoretically possible, but is not something that can possibly happen in this law. In fact, if you want to say, "Is the law succeeding? " you don't have to ask the administration. You could ask the insurers, right? Because the insurers have recently been saying they're very happy with the mix of people -- the mix of people you have in the exchanges is sound. It's sustainable. They don't need -- they don't need it to change. They've got a mix of people that's healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward. What's more, even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than they expect, you had -- the Kaiser Health Foundation ran the numbers and said, "What's the worst-case scenario? " We don't get any increase in young people at all. And they said it would be about a 2.4 percent increase in premiums 2.4 percent increase in health insurance premiums. If any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a 2.4 percent increase over your bill last year, you'd say, "Thank God it's only a 2.4 percent increase," right? That's a rounding error. No one notices 2.4 percent. That couldn't possibly set off a death spiral. So there's really no plausible mechanism that the law could fail. So I think what they're giving you -- instead of what used to be the plausible mechanism for which the -- this can fail, they're giving you a mix of wishes and hopes and completely debunked facts. They said, "Cost growth leveled after 2010. No. Cost growth in 2012 was lower than at any year in 50 years. And in fact -- this is important because when the law was passed, cost growth was the main thing they talked about. Obamacare was supposed to control costs. And they said, "No, no, it's going to make costs explode with all this bureaucracy regulation. They're going to go out of control. What happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimistic estimates believed it would be before the law was signed. And so now, they're reduced -- instead of saying, "This disaster of cost growth is going to happen," they're going to say, "This incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence. So, all they're saying is essentially that this wonderful thing that's happened has nothing to do with the gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to the lowest level in 50 years. And you can't prove that it's not a coincidence. But you have to -- see, this is indicative of the mentality we're dealing with, where it simply moves from one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario. So you have to wonder, "Why are they simple moving from one disaster scenario to another disaster scenario? " Actually, I wanted to debunk a couple points they made, because a lot of this is just -- we've heard from the other side -- are not true. I can't give you links and charts to debunk them, but let me say that it's not the case that 5 million policies have been canceled. That's a number that was floating about that you can't verify. It's almost certainly not true. Many journalists have tried to figure out exactly how many policies have been canceled. And they don't have good enough records to know, but they know it's not 5 million. And they suspect -- the administration suspects it's closer to one-tenth of that figure. They can't actually prove that either, but for various reasons, you don't have a good enough count. This -- that's almost certainly nowhere close to 5 million. And that's a big number that's -- they're citing because they're saying, that -- those are the losers. But it's really nowhere close to that. Yet they say -- Megan said we can't -- we can't say for sure how many -- how -- that there are more insured now than there were before. We can't say for sure, because again, this number can't exactly be counted. We don't know that 400,000 -- it was 500,000. But we know it's not anywhere close to 5 million. And it's a mortal certainty that far more people have health insurance now than would have had in absence of the law. So why are we having this kind of lurch, from one argument, abandoning these arguments when they disappear, and simply coming up with new ones? The truth is, they disagree with the goals of the law. And I think you could hear that in their remarks. They say, "There's less choice. And it's true. The government says insurers have to provide certain benefits right. They have to provide pregnancy coverage. That's -- and maternity care. Those are the most controversial things that are mostly cited, because they want people who are male or old to not have to pay for those things. And they want people who are young and female and might have to bear children to pay those costs themselves, because that's an ideological difference between the two sides. And that's fine for them to have an ideological difference between the two sides. But we're not here to debate whether this law is a good idea. We're here to debate whether the law is actually working, and the truth is the only reason they're desperately trying to claim the law is not working is because they oppose national health insurance.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate, where our motion is "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " And now we go on to round two, and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you and our live audience. Now, I want to remind you that tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org, and on FORA .tv, and if you're watching this live stream right now, we would like to hear from you. Send us your questions on Twitter or Facebook with hashtag Obamacare so that we don't miss it. Be sure to include your city, state, and first name. And if you're going to do that, what we really request from you is not a statement or an assertion of your views, but really a question that moves these debaters along on the motion, the specific motion of whether Obamacare is beyond rescue. Try not to be ideological. Try to be provocative. So on into round two, and round two, as I said, is where the debaters address each other directly.

" We have two teams arguing for and against that. The team arguing for the motion, Scott Gottlieb and Megan McArdle, have argued -- in a sense, they are arguing that the law from its beginnings has always been beyond rescue, that it reduces competition, it reduces choice, it pushes people into Medicaid, a system which does not have good medical outcomes, or at least not the kind of medical outcomes that people would aspire to for it. And they've described the law as a Rube Goldberg kind of apparatus and that the administration only gets away with calling it "successful" in any way by continuously moving the goalposts. Team arguing against the motion, Dr. Douglas Kamerow and Jonathan Chait, say, "Yeah, the law is not perfect," but they're arguing that it's working in real ways already, that there are more people insured now than there were three years ago in the United States, that standards are being forced, and that -- in general, that we've come a long way. And they also argue that the terms of the basic law, the aspirations of the law, that lots of countries do it, and that, in fact, it does work. They argue that the opposition from their opponents is more ideological, that they just don't actually want the law to succeed, a question I'd actually like to put to the side arguing for the motion. Is that the case? Would you -- in an ideal world, would Obamacare succeed or would you hate that? Scott Gottlieb.

I think there were far more efficient ways to do that. You could've given people incentives to get insured and stay insured, and it would have required that you subsidize certain people to get into the marketplace and subsidize them through transitions in life where they might otherwise not have the income and lose coverage. There's nothing inherently wrong with pooling people based on what state they live in, for example, if that's the point, if this is copying Mitt Romney's plan. What's inherently wrong with this law is the way that the law tries to prescribe a uniform federal standard for what needs to be in everyone's insurance policy. And so these decisions get made in a political context, and you end up with policies that are exceedingly expensive, laden down with mandates that don't meet what consumers want. And then you tell insurers they can't underwrite risk, they can't use cost sharing as a tool to steer people to certain benefits or others, they can't change the benefit design, and so they're forced to do one thing which is to narrow the networks of providers that people have access to and to skinny down the drug formularies, which is exactly what we've done in Medicaid.

Surgical sterilization is in. Certain things are out. You have a law that gets laden down with mandates and it ends up being -- exceeding expensive to provide this coverage to everyone, they have to do it, the insurers have to go after the network, exactly what we've done in Medicaid. We've promised a very rich set of benefits on paper in Medicaid. It looks like a fabulous program, but we know Medicaid recipients can't get access to the care. I don't think it's being done politically because it -- these decisions now are being made in Washington.

So to that extent, it's true. I'm picking on stuff that I did not predict because my worries at the time of passage were about things like the federal budget deficit and would the cost controls hold. Will this tamp down innovation, which is, if you think about the millions of unborn or still living but not yet sick people who can be cured by innovations that haven't happened yet, I was worried about that. But we haven't gotten to the point where I can worry about those sorts of things. We've gotten to the point where I'm now worried that this is going to implode and destroy the market for insurance.

It's worse than sex ads on Twitter. I mean, that is a bad conversion rate. That tells you people are looking at these plans and not buying them because they're not good plans for consumers because they weren't designed to be.

I have long been proposing that the government should provide catastrophic reinsurance for people, basically picking up medical costs above fifteen percent of their income. Its something that preserves the market mechanism. Its progressive. Everyone is -- you know, you're taking care poor, but otherwise it's progressive. It preserves the market mechanism, it makes sure people do not get bankrupted by their medical bills. I think that is actually the kind of system that you could grow out of Obamacare if it failed.

Every year -- this is a provision that a lot of people haven't noticed yet. Every year that these subsidies make these sort of value of the health plans sold in this law get re-priced. In Medicare Part D they also get re- priced. The subsidies get re-priced. They get re-priced each year from a blended average of all the plans in the marketplace. They had a convergence of sort of a mean value of the plans. In this marketplace they get re-priced off the second cheapest plan in every market. The second cheapest plan in Florida is a plan that has seven pediatricians for a county with 250,000 kids. Next year all the policies in Florida will now be re-priced off that plan. So all the plans will have to conform to that benefit structure. That is a death spiral.

It doesn't just change the coverage. It also talks about who's going to be taking care of patient on Medicaid, what the doctor is going to be paid. As you know, as a practicing doctor, where you practice a lot of places don't take Medicaid and they don't take it because the rates are laughable. Reimbursement is very low. It's not because, I dont think, because the patients have certain problems that they're not willing to deal with, seems unlikely. It's a matter of dollars and cents. One of the things it does, at least temporarily it can presumably be extended, raising the rates of Medicaid and Medicare. A lot of doctors take care of Medicare patients. And also I would think that you'd be happy to see these kinds of -- it seems to me at least, speaking from the inside , as a conservative philosophy. You're saying look, if this doesn't work very well, clearly these high-priced providers, wherever they are, are going to have to make some kind of a change. Hospitals or other places that are going to be left out of the networks pretty soon --

I mean, if you look at the quality of these plans, if you look at the networks, and I'm putting out data on this next week, I hope everyone goes to the website and sees it. If you look at the networks in Obamacare they are Medicaid networks. If you look at the plans that are preparing bids for next year, it's Medicaid plans that didnt get into the market this year. This will evolve into a Medicaid benefit. We didn't need to obligate people to a Medicaid benefit and we have done nothing to fix the existing Medicaid benefit. The changes you talk about was a temporary increase, a small increase in payments to primary care providers, that now sunsetted at the very point that we're going to push 19 more million people into Medicaid. Can you imagine trying to service 19 more million people with the existing Medicaid program? What is that going to look like?

Now, our opponents have made two different claims about Medicaid. Scotts made a terrible argument about the quality of Medicaid and Megan made one that is merely bad. Scott's argument, he's obliquely citing studies that have taken two populations, one of which is on Medicaid and one which is not on Medicaid and compared their health. Now, if you're on Medicaid you're in a terrible place. Something has gone bad in your life. You're very poor. You're very sick. Bad things are happening to you. So, a lot of studies are comparing two completely different kinds of populations and finding the people on Medicaid are worse off.

I think the discussion about Medicaid is operative here, because this is -- this is a real dilemma that I can't get to the bottom of. People feel good about Medicaid in Washington. I worked in Washington. People look at the benefits that are being promised on paper in Medicaid and think that it is a fabulous program. The practical reality is that anyone who works in the medical marketplace knows that's just not the case. We have done the same thing with Obamacare. We have promised something that looks very good on paper. The practical reality that's already taking shape in the marketplace is people are not going to be able to get what they're being promised on paper. And so, the question becomes, why do we feel good about what we do in Washington on paper when the reality doesn't approximate what we've said we've done --

Well, that actually takes me to -- to -- -- that takes me to my question, because my sense of what this motion says is that the Rube Goldberg machine that Megan's described the Obamacare plan as being is doomed finally to crash a -- crashing to a halt. And your opponents are saying, it may be a Rube Goldberg machine, but it's going to keep moving in its fashion. And it already is moving and things are happening, and it can be tweaked around the edges. You're -- you're not actually describing a Rube Goldberg machine coming to a halt. You're describing a Rube Goldberg machine producing an outcome that you don't like.

That means the whole outreach campaign that the administration, its outside allies, and in the insurers had planned to direct people to this website -- which was broken -- had to be put off.

My question is, "Why did we --" if we wanted to target 20 million people, which is what this law inevitably is going to end up doing, why did we have to disrupt the insurance scheme for 350 million Americans?

Sir, in the reddish shirt, I'm not good with color description once we're off the basic red, chartreuse? You can stand up and tell us your name, please.

Nobody actually believes those penalties are going to be enforced. They're just a claw back on your tax return if you're owed a refund. A clever accountant can easily structure your tax returns so that you would never have to pay a penalty. I think everyone recognizes the individual mandate, so- called tax penalty really isn't an operating feature in this anymore, and will probably be suspended this year, but they will wait till after March 31 to do it.

We could've addressed those issues in a far more disrupting with so many dislocations in the marketplace. I think we still can. This isn't the edifice to do it. We -- I --

We already have a highway system. And so looking at what another country has done with a really long history is helpful in the sense that you can see elements that work, but that doesn't mean that we can have Germany's health care system. We have a different set of doctors and nurses and patients and all sorts of things, and that's why I like the idea of a kind of very American - - we're going to have the government insure your financial losses after a certain point, but we're going to leave you out there as a market driven consumer, making choices of whatever health care you want when you get sick.

You can say, "We're not the same, we're different," but it is interesting that every advanced economy in the west and some more in the east has these kinds of programs, and yet there is something special about us where we can't seem, apparently, figure out a way to do it here. We've got to have some special American take on it. So I think we probably can learn from it. I think we probably can learn a lot from other countries.

We have people who want to exercise more choice in their benefits design. We have people who have higher expectations than what many people are willing to acquiesce to in other countries, and the one final point I'd make is that the structures in Obamacare that I've talked about tonight, the narrow networks, the closed drug formulators, I guarantee you they're going to be showing up in your commercial plans in the next two years. These structures will not be confined to Obamacare. They will now migrate into the commercial marketplace.

It's a very partial anecdotal kind of slightly hysterical way.

The point is to make a change over a series of years. Now, the outreach campaign to the public is something that by definition just takes months and months and months and years and years and years to build up. And no one envisioned that the law would reach its coverage target even under the best circumstances the first year. And again, the website responded. So, in 2013 they lost two-thirds of the available time. So naturally you're just going to move back the target for the ramp up year, you're going to hit it more slowly, but nothing about that process changes the law's ability to fundamentally reach its goals in the coarse of time.

You know just one comment to follow up on what Doug said. What Doug is talking about reform, these are things we've been talking about for a decade and they're not a key feature of Obamacare, although they were in the law. We could've done a lot of that without disrupting the entire commercial insurance marketplace these were bipartisan ideas. I'm not sure that Obamacare is going to successfully implement them anyway. I'll just give you one anecdote. They have a new law that hospitals get penalized for readmission, so hospitals are admitting fewer patients. When patients show up in the ER they're being put in what's called observation status. They're sitting in the hospital for 36 hours and not being admitted and so since they're not admitted to the hospital, they're considered outpatient, so they're being hit with 20 percent co-pays on that.

It did it in its first year, which I'm not clear we're doing now. But in other ways, it didn't do what it was expecting to do. For example, they had expected to really lower the rate of uncompensated care, which was something that you hear a lot about. And they did lower it somewhat, but it came in at only about 40 percent lower than the projections -- instead of the 100 percent lower than theyd basically been expecting. Costs are still going up. Medical bankruptcies don't seem to have abated nearly as much as you would think, given how much insurance -- you know, they've now -- they're now the -- by far the lowest rate of uninsured people in the nation. But Massachusetts is also a little bit hard to compare to the rest of the country. They already had the lowest rate of uninsured people in the country before they started this. They've got a weird mix of employers -- you know, a lot more employer-based insurance than you're going to get in Texas.

There's a huge amount of data. It contradicts what the others are trying to say. Let me cite one. Two Urban Institute researchers published a study finding that the number of adults reporting that they skipped care because of high costs in Massachusetts fell 17 percent to 11 percent for the first two years of the law. So I think of all the things it's trying to do, is -- quit -- stop people who can't get healthcare because they can't afford it. That was the main goal of the law and it succeeded

There were a lot of cost reforms in the way that hospitals were compensated, that happened before 2012, right? So, instead of paying people based on more care -- the more medicine you perform, the more money you get -- it changed the model where people get paid based on providing quality of care and actually in measurable ways of improving patients health. So, one way is it penalized hospitals that have high rates of infections. Because previously, hospitals -- if your patients get an infection, that's a bonus for you. They have to go back in the hospital and get treated again. And you make more money. So, instead the law changed and said, "No, we're going to penalize you if you have a high rate of infections. And the rate of infection has actually fallen. There's a wide series of reforms like this changed the cost structure of American medicine. And I think a lot of researchers have looked at this and concluded they're actually working on changing the cost model and making people try to provide quality instead of just more and more care for more and more money.

But that was only in Medicare. And the cost reductions have been occurring across the board, not just in Medicare, a recent paper at Brookings suggests it's probably due to a combination of the recession and technological slowdown, we haven't had a lot of innovation for whatever reason in the last few years. Going forward, there are things like accountable care organizations that think they're not looking as great as they thought that they were. Other issues with electronic medical records, also not looking as great as we had hoped. And some Medicare pilot programs. And eventually, the comparative effectiveness for -- slow Medicare costs and it doesn't come down on its own. But all -- most of that stuff hasn't really -- either hasn't finished being implemented or isn't expected to return dividends or is going to be started being implemented this year.

That's how the law seeks to control cost. That's what accountable peer organizations bundle payment share savings. It's all forms of capitation, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. That's why doctors are selling them back to hospitals, so they can form larger entities and take that capitated risk. If you think that's a good idea, then you're more than welcome.

We already on net transfer a lot to older people and a lot of the set up here is transferring more and more to older people and to sicker people, which is a kind of a separate issue. It's actually kind of interesting how few people -- how little the transfers are until you get to be about 50. And I know we're all hoping to make it there, but is that politically sustainable when that's the minority of the voting base and when they're already getting most of the transfers and growing every day? And when the budget is under strain, when we have to find ways to cut, I do question that. I question whether in 20 years we're still going to be gung ho about giving money to people over the age of 50 instead of people over the age of 65.

I want to thank the audience as well. The motion that we're talking about is, "Obamacare is now beyond rescue. " We've had a lot of fun throwing statistics back and forth and trying to make clever remarks, but it seems to me this really comes down to a very personal question. Given where we are, whats come before, and likely to happen in two scenarios. We keep Obamacare or we dump it, what should we do? And like most of us, I could cite personal stories about health care coverage and access, recent ones about friends who had trouble getting coverage because of preexisting conditions, and now with the Obamacare see their insurance and drug costs decrease markedly to 75 percent, or about young people like two of our kids who've already gotten affordable insurance coverage between college and their first jobs. But I think really the most telling story that I want to mention in conclusion is about Medicaid, much maligned in this discussion today, but 35 years ago, my first job for the Public Health Service was working as a GP in the National Service Board, the Community Health Center in an urban underserved part of town, but because that city was in this state, that is, in New York State, the state that had and still has a generous Medicaid program, most of our patients had insurance. Most of our patients had access to care. They were poor. They were working or disabled. But they had health care, they had a medical home, and they had prescription drug benefits. And they benefitted from this, despite what you've heard here today. A lot of good care is delivered to Medicaid patients.

Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|243|R4|SCOTT GOTTLIEB|for|4|13|4|0|0|21|0|48|1|0|1|4|58|27|0|5|10|0|0|1|0|215|13|0|0|0|0|0|16|1|0|3|34|0|6|4|4|0|0|2|15|1|3|18|49|29|52|13|45|0|0|1|0|0|24|29|0|10|5|12|64|3|1|5|15|366|If I were to -- if I were asked to distill downObamacare's essential flaw, it would simply be this, the law tries to exert so much control over aspects of medicine and health care that it's subject to so much heterogeneity and individualism that nobody should ever have thought that they could be micromanaged from a remote bureaucracy in Washington in a big piece of legislation. The result is what you're seeing, an over- engineering that may have started out elegant on someone's flowcharts but became undone when it was subjected to political realities and the marketplace. And it has -- and the marketplace had to conform to its rules. And the result is a massive exercise in unintended consequences and a health insurance product that clearly people don't want. People are saying this is just a rough start, but I will tell you this will get worse as this scheme unfolds. There already evidence plans arent entering the market in 2015, premiums certainly will rise next year, probably not as much as we thought because of the reinsurance pools, but those pools eventually go away. Small businesses will dump people once their grandfathering is up at the end of this year, and you're going to see small businesses' cancellation notifications. Networks and drug formulators will have to be narrowed further next year as this whole market gets repriced off the second cheapest plan in every state. And these structures in Obamacare that are so unappealing will start to evolve into the commercial marketplace just like the Part D structures involved in tier commercial drug plans. 2014 was the high water mark for this scheme. The insurance part will only get worse from here. And this is hardly the ambition that is that its architects had in mind. Obamacare surely will help some people. Those below 200 percent of the federal poverty level will be helped by this I think, but a lot more will be hurt as they find themselves spending more money than they previously did to buy their way out of this scheme. We didn't have to hurt some people to help some people in this country, but that's precisely what we did.

Ladies and gentlemen, Jonathan Chait.
Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|245|R4|JONATHAN CHAIT|against|4|29|19|0|2|26|1|45|4|0|3|5|82|27|0|11|13|0|0|2|0|250|14|4|0|0|4|1|29|0|1|7|46|0|0|7|9|5|0|4|20|9|8|28|41|33|76|6|64|0|1|8|0|0|38|22|0|11|9|33|71|13|1|2|21|409|Let me let you in on a secret. When we set up this debate back in the fall, it was a while ago, it looked like Obamacare might really collapse. The website was broken. We didn't know when it would be fixed. We didn't know if it would be fixed. Some people thought it would never be fixed. It looks like it's possible the law would actually not come into effect. But now it has come into effect. Now we're actually living the experience of this law. So the position that was an outlandish and somewhat exaggerated fear three months ago, is now kind of silly. And I think if you look back into the history of libertarian anti-statism in America, there's a long tradition of these kinds of fear mongering predictions, senators who were opposed to child labor laws a few years ago saying that children would refuse to do chores in their household, Ronald Reagan saying, "If we pass Medicare the government will tell doctors they can't live here, they can't live there, and one day we'll look back at a day when we had freedom in America and wonder what happened to it. " So this is a constant recurring pattern, Social Security, all kinds of civil rights laws, labor laws. The American far right lives in terror of government, and it's ideologically understandable that they would oppose these laws, but they translate this ideological terror into a series of verifiable predictions about what will happen if these laws come into effect. And one day we're going to look back at the kinds of predictions they've been making about Obamacare, and those will go in the time capsule, and they'll look just as silly as the predictions that were made by all these other reforms, which is not to say that it works perfectly. It's not to say those other things that work perfectly. Believe me, child labor was a big part of the economy a hundred years ago and when we banned it it actually imposed a lot of disruption and pain on people. Right now it seems obvious and back then it was really hard. Families lost an income. But these changes did fundamentally work. The market responded. People responded and I think when we look back time we'll see that the people who were saying the law must fail were really just people who didn't agree with its goals in the first place.

Our motion is: Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. And here to summarize her position in support of this motion, Megan McArdle. She's a blogger and columnist for Bloomberg view. Ladies and gentlemen, Megan McArdle.
Obamacare is now beyond rescue|i2Debates/011514 obamacare.p|247|R4|MEGAN MCARDLE|for|1|23|11|0|0|31|0|55|7|1|8|3|82|29|0|8|16|0|4|0|0|269|3|5|1|0|0|8|23|0|0|4|31|0|5|14|17|2|0|0|12|6|4|21|59|62|60|11|57|0|0|0|0|0|33|20|0|12|0|13|84|7|6|2|25|430|So, I don't want to go into an anecdote; we can talk about people who just got coverage and there are people who have and couldnt get it before and Im happy for them, or I could talk about the people who have written me and said now I can't afford coverage and I had it before what do I do, and I don't have anything to tell them. That's not really the assessment of the law. They're just individual stories. It doesnt tell us how its going. And the question isn't whether the status quo was bad, or anyone on this stage is a bad person. I think we all didnt want the status quo. We're all good people. We all want to help the other Americans to be as healthy as possible. The question is whether the law is undermining its own goals. And to think about going forward, we, you know, Mr. Chait says its now here. In fact, we still have a long way to go with a bunch of unpopular stuff that is going to happen. Small businesses are starting to get a wave of cancellations that are going to come through the year, and they're being asked for a lot more money. A lot of that is due to Obamacare. The Cadillac tax, 40 percent surcharge on generous health insurance is especially hard on companies with old sick people, but a lot of benefits managers are saying basically everyone is going to have to go to light plans and scale down rather than get hit by that tax. Weve got comparative effectiveness research which is going to start determining what sorts of things Medicare will reimburse at what rates. We've got the individual mandate. People aren't going to pay it this year. They pay it in 2015. As each of those things comes due, there will be an outcry from people who are affected. And the administration has so far shown no willingness to stand up. Yes, you may have to break an omelet to make eggs, but the administration is not going to tell the eggs that, and the Republicans certainly aren't going to make the eggs crack itself. So, if we are not willing to impose the pain, and so far we haven't, this law cannot survive. It is set up as a giant piece of interlocking machinery. You can't just rip the carburetor out and hope that its still working. That is why Obamacare is beyond rescue, because we are not willing to face the hard choices the law made necessary.

The motion is: Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. If you agree with this motion, push number one. If you disagree, push number two. If you're undecided, push number three. And remember it's the difference between the opening vote and this vote that determines our winners in percentage point terms. Well the results locked out in just a couple of minutes. Give me a few more seconds before we lock it out. Okay. We have locked out the votes and I just want to say a couple of things. If I could have your attention, please. This is something that really is important for us to say, because the whole purpose, goal, and culture of Intelligence Squared is to raise the level of public discourse to get people on the stage to argue about the ideas and not about each others characters and personalities, just as Megan McArdle said, everyone up here is good, they all basically in the long run want the same thing. I just want to congratulate these debaters for bringing that spirit to this conversation -- -- and I don't think this has ever happened before, but all of the questions were good tonight. They were all really, really well phrased and I want to thank everybody who got up and asked a question. I just wanted to ask Scott Gottlieb, I thought during the middle of the debate I saw your smartphone open on the desk and you were watching a Twitter feed. Is that your lifeline coming in there?

Wed like you all to Tweet about this debate. Use the Twitter handle @IQ2US, the hashtag is Obamacare. We want to also talk about our upcoming debates. We've made a change to our lineup. Our debate next month -- it's on February 12th. The topic was going to be on labor unions. That has been moved to our Fall 2014 debates. Taking its place -- we're going to do it here at the Kaufman -- the motion will be Grant Snowden Clemency. Arguing for the motion, we'll have Ben Wizner. He is Snowden's legal adviser and director of the ACLU's speech privacy and technology project. He'll be for the motion. Against the motion, Ambassador James Woolsey. He's Chairman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and former director of Central Intelligence. His partner, also against this motion, Andrew McCarthy, the former top federal prosecutor and contributing editor at National Review. The remaining seat on that panel arguing for the motion has not been filled yet. We will announce it on our website shortly. It's not who you think it is -- you know -- The rest of our spring topics are these: Putin's Russia. We'll be doing universities and online education. We'll be doing millenials in the workplace. And we'll be doing death. We're going to be traveling up to Harvard shortly to debate affirmative action on campus, and to the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where we will be debating the targeted killing of U.S. Citizens abroad and its constitutionality. Tickets for all of our spring debates are on sale through our website www.iq2US.org. And for those of you who can't be in our live audiences and those of you who are watching now on our website or on for a.TV -- we can be seen that way. And as I've said, all of these debates will be available on NPR stations across the nation. All right. We have the final results in. Our motion is this: Obamacare is now beyond rescue. We've had you vote before the debate and had you vote a second time after hearing the arguments on this very motion. And remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in your judgment -- in percentage point terms -- will be declared our winner. So, the initial vote on the motion: Obamacare is now beyond rescue -- before the debate, 16 percent agreed with the motion. 53 percent were against. 31 percent were undecided. So, those are the first results. Remember, you voted a second time. The winner is the one that has changed the numbers the most in percentage point terms. So, here are the results of the second vote. Obamacare is now beyond rescue. The team arguing for the motion, their vote went to 32 percent. That's an increase of 16 percentage points -- That's the number to beat. The team against the motion, they went from 53 percent. Second vote, 59 percent. That's only six percent. It is not enough. The team arguing for the motion: Obamacare is now beyond rescue has triumphed in this debated. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

Israel can live with nuclear Iran|i2Debates/011613 israel iran.p|8|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|2|7|12|3|0|10|0|22|0|0|1|3|28|6|2|5|7|0|0|1|0|98|2|0|0|0|0|2|2|0|0|0|19|2|0|2|2|3|0|1|5|0|5|8|18|11|27|6|15|0|0|0|0|0|6|8|0|7|3|5|26|2|0|0|6|161|Well, I'd say the best argument is that first of all Israel can certainly deter any kind of Iranian nuclear attack on its own soil. It's got vastly greater military capabilities than Iran does. It can defend itself better. And it can unleash absolute devastation on Iran. Iran has had disturbing rhetoric, but they've never actually done anything that's irrational or self-destructive, so that they can be deterred just like any other country from using those kinds of weapons. The other argument against is that the ultimate way in which Israel would be able to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is not just cyber attacks or these clandestine operations we've been reading about, but an actual attack, a bombing of their facilities, which would very likely result in a war in the Middle East, and that war could leave Israel isolated, it could entrench the Ayatollahs, it could actually over the long run result in a diminution of Israel's security.

Israel can live with nuclear Iran|i2Debates/011613 israel iran.p|10|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|1|9|3|0|0|11|0|19|0|0|4|0|31|9|0|6|9|0|0|0|0|93|3|0|0|0|0|0|7|0|0|3|11|0|0|3|6|0|0|0|0|0|3|6|20|19|19|2|22|0|0|0|0|0|8|17|0|4|2|0|27|3|0|0|9|159|Well, I mean, that's the argument in a sense why Israel can tolerate it because the costs of not tolerating it are too high. The counterargument would be that it doesn't matter whether Iran uses nuclear weapons or not, the mere possession of them changes the game. Iran is a revolutionary power, and if it has the protection of nuclear weapons there's no telling what kind of provocations we're going to get out of them. They certainly would be unconstrained in providing more advanced missiles to Hezbollah. They could be more unconstrained in supporting Assad in Syria. God knows what influence they might try to exercise in Iran. And it's not just about Iranian nukes. If Iran gets nuclear weapons, Egypt is not going to be far behind, and Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and the last thing we need in terms of global security is a multi-nuclear Middle East. So the stakes in tonight's debate are very, very high.

Ladies and gentlemen, our debaters this evening. Thank you. And I just want to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz. It's the nuclear secret that never was, that Israel has the only nuclear arsenal in the Middle East; its leaders have never confirmed it nor never denied it, but one thing they cop to without hesitation is their total rejection of Iran ever getting the bomb. They talk about going to war to stop that from happening, because they say that Israel cannot without live a nuclear Iran. Or can it?

Yes or no to this statement: Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. A debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters to argue for and against this motion: Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. Our debate, as always, will go in three rounds and then, you, the live audience, votes to choose a winner and only one side wins. Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. On the side arguing for the motion, James Dobbins. He is the director of international security and defense policy center at RAND. His partner is Reuven Pedatzur, a senior military affairs analyst with Haaretz. On the side arguing against the motion Israel can live with a nuclear Iran, Shmuel Bar. He is director of studies at the Institute of Policy and Strategy in Herzliya, Israel; and his partner, Jeffrey Goldberg, who is national correspondent for the Atlantic and columnist for Bloomberg View. Our motion is Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. And now let's meet the team arguing for the emotion. First, let's welcome, again, James Dobbins. And James, you are now at RAND, where you are director of the international security and defense policy center, but in a previous life, working with the State Department, you were at the talks for the conference for the setting up of the state of Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11. And, in that, you were involved in negotiations that involved the Iranians and you said that the Iranian delegation was helpful in the process and you know that that's not really the reputation that the Iranians normally bring to the table.

I think it was just sort of a combination of gratitude and fear. They were grateful that we just knocked off one of their two principal regional rivals, which was the Taliban, and they were fearful that they might be next. And so it was a combination. It was also a different Iranian government than the one we have today; it was a reformist regime operating within an environment that limited their powers but not limited to the point they couldn't reach out. It was a genuine opportunity that we flubbed. I'm not going to argue tonight that we still have that opportunity.

Reuven Pedatzur, ladies and gentlemen. Reuven, you are also arguing for the motion that Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. You have obviously a serious personal stake in this, you are a resident of the state of Israel, you were a fighter pilot -- you were a pilot in the Israeli air force. You now write for the Haaretz newspaper on issues of security and military affairs. Reuven, you told us back in 2006, seven years ago, where you stood on this issue, when you wrote a piece back then that said "Let them have nukes," them being Iran. What sort of reaction did you get back then?

Ladies and gentlemen, Reuven Pedatzur. Our motion is Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. And two debaters arguing against it: first, Shmuel Bar, ladies and gentlemen. Shmuel, like your opponent, you have that stake of being an Israeli citizen; you also served in war as an intelligence officer. You now direct studies at the Institute of Policy and Strategy in Herzliya, Israel. Just a short preview of your argument here. It's sometimes argued that the Iranians would be no more interested in nuclear war than the Soviets were during the Cold War, and they didn't use it. So give us one reason that that argument just doesnt end this debate right now.

Pearl Harbor wouldn't have happened. Barbarossa wouldn't have happened. Certainly Stalingrad wouldn't have happened. So apparently things happen which are not necessarily because it's in the interest of somebody to let it happen but because of other dynamics.

Jeffrey, you're also arguing against the motion that Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. You're a national correspondent for the Atlantic, a columnist for Bloomberg View. You're in a unique position in that you've had more exclusive interviews with Bibi Netanyahu, I think, than any other American journalist over the past several years. You've been inside the guy's head, or you've been near the head. Where do you think he is in terms of his thinking seriously about his willingness to go to war over this? Is it a posture, or is it a decision?

So it's a mystery to me too. I would say, to sum him up in a sentence, I would say that he has many manifestations of a typical, insincere politician. On the Iran question, I think he's actually sincere. What that means for policy, I don't know. But he is very sincerely gripped by this issue.

So as we said before, in this debate, our live audience, act as our judges. By the time the debate is over, we will have asked you two times to vote, the first time telling us where you stand on this motion before hearing the debate, the motion being: Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. Then we'll have you vote a second time after the debate is over, where you stand on the point after hearing the arguments. And the team who has moved its numbers the most over the course of the evening will be declared our winner. So let's register your preliminary vote. Our motion is: Israel, live with a nuclear Iran. If you side with this motion at this point, push number one on your keypad. If you're against it, push number two. And if you're undecided, push number three. And if you think that you made a mistake, just correct it. The system will lock in the last vote that you did. And all of the other numbers are inactive, so just deal with 1, 2 or 3. And it looks like everybody is done. So remember, again, we're going to reveal the result of that vote after you've heard all the arguments and after you have voted the second time. That will come at the end of the debate in its final minutes. And that is how you, our audience, will choose the winner. So we go in three rounds.

He's a former pilot for the Israeli Air Force and services as director of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Strategic Dialogue at Natania Academic Center. Ladies and gentlemen, Reuven Pedatzur.

Where are the results? No results yet? Anyway, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran? The short answer is yes. Any questions? Okay. But the real question is not this one. The real question, do we have another choice? And unfortunately, the answer is no. Because it's possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran will have nuclear weapons. So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then? What will be our policy in this case when Iran will have the weapons? Unfortunately there is -- as I said, there are no public debates on this, so we don't know what they think over there about future policy. What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons? The most effective and maybe the only way to deter Iran is to abandon our ambiguity, nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence. And since, in Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game. And when I refer to Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources. I don't know anything. And I have to use this phrase, "according to foreign sources. " But Israel has to change its policy and to move, as I say, to nuclear deterrence -- with new rules of the game. And the other side should know what are the rules of the game. There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it. For example, if Israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear missiles. And in this case, Israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or not. Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources, and it, Tehran-- , it's fine and so on and so on. And it should be clear for the other side what will happen. And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen. What will happen, that Iran will be destroyed, and we'll go back to the Middle Ages. And I don't see any Iranian national interests that justifies this cost. So I believe that we can deter them. I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality. We cannot deter these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs. And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack. But I don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent. For this, we'll have to change not just the policy. We have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have. And again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles. So we have second-strike capability, probably. So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers. They are not rational. They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb. And the Ayatollahs are not like this. And it seems from professional and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we'll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders. We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not against Israel. It's based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the '80s, not against Israel. And it's very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program. And ironically, possession of nuclear weapons may moderate the Iranian leadership, exactly what happened with the Chinese leadership in '64 when they got their nuclear weapons, and they started acting like rational state. And another example is India and Pakistan. Only 23 seconds more.

Thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you to Intelligence Squared. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Reuven. I -- as someone who's covered Pakistan extensively, I'm not going to sit here and make believe that I would hold up Pakistan as a model of stability -- -- and rational nuclear deterrence, but we can talk about that later. Since you brought up this subject of the nature of the Iranian regime and what they believe and what they think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute. What do we have in -- right now in the world? It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in the post-World War II international order. We have a member state of the United Nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another member state of the United Nations. That is Israel. And they're very, very clear and consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the Islamic Republic. I'll give you a couple of examples. This is from the supreme leader of Iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader -- he's the guy who sets the policy. Quote, this is from last February, "The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cut off. " Its feelings are echoed regularly among the Iranian, and military, and intelligence elite. I'll give you another example. General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, "The fact is, is that there is no other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed. " General Hassan Firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, "The Iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel. " Finally, Mohammad Hassan Rahimian , who is a top aide to Khamenei, said in the January 2010 television interview, quote, "We have manufactured missiles that allow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust. " Mr. Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part -- -- of the Iranian regime. Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Iranian regime works to destroy individual Jews. Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group, is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The rocket that it fires periodically into Israel are Iranian manufacture. The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza very recently are Iranian rockets. Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples around the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia, in Thailand. And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the current defense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities for direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina. So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state. You're dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, which begs the question, "What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safety of Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the annihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring about that annihilation? " And that's the question that we're dealing with today. Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think. The first is to -- is to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is the foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a new holocaust. And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastors with execution unless they convert to Islam. And it's responsible for a quarter of the American combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within its borders. But, on the other hand, no one's perfect -- -- and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American- killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible, rational, and enlightened way. The second response is what I call the, for lack of a better term, the "Uncle Morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sitting in Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osama bin Laden's third cousin by marriage. And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Morty response is to say "You know, it's 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next Tuesday and we're all done, and we're finished. " The third response -- and this is what I want to get into during the course of this debate. The third response acknowledges a couple things. Is that it isn't 1938. The Jewish people do not stand defenseless and naked before the world. Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that single bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East is going to have a very, very hard time surviving. Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel, in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrence don't really apply in this situation. I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be difficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation. The first is very clear to everyone, including President Obama. The day after there's going to be -- the day after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the Middle East. President Obama has warned about this. He said very explicitly that a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing. So you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at each other. That's not a recipe for stability or happiness; it's certainly not a recipe for stability for the Jewish state. Second reason: if you believe that Israel can only survive if it makes peace with its neighbors, then you will be opposed to the idea of Iran getting a nuclear bomb. Israel cannot survive in a Middle East in which America is a defeated and weakened ally. America is Israel's most important ally. If Iran trumps America, if Iran beats America by getting a nuclear weapon, it means that the Arab states that were predisposed to make peace with Israel -- and we know the peace process is . Anyway, they will align with Iran, because Iran is the winner of that conflict. The third and most obvious point is Hamas and Hezbollah, even now, periodically fire large numbers of rockets at Israeli civilians. Imagine the power that they will have when they can fire those rockets under the protection of the Iranian nuclear umbrella. Again, there is a real chance that an Iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the Middle East. Even without that conflagration, it becomes very, very hard to envision how Israel survives in the long term. Thank you very much.

And a reminder of what's going on, we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two against two, who are arguing it out over this motion: Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. You're heard two of the opening statements. And now, on to the third. Debating in support of the argument, James Dobbins; he is a former U.S. assistant secretary of state and special envoy under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. He is now director of the international security and defense policy center at the RAND Corporation. Ladies and gentlemen, James Dobbins.

The proposition is, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran. The answer to that question is yes. You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive. In fact, technically, you don't even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive. And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive. And Jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder. But -- so I mean, I think if you debate at that level, it's pretty clear. There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise will be automatic and certain. It's a question of risk. And so I think in a sense, the real debate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran. And the answer is, not if they can help it, obviously. Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea. And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it. We have a massive probably unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort and cyber attacks. Now, these may work in some combination. But I'd have to acknowledge that they may not. And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel -- prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. And I think although that's not precisely what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that. Now, the threshold for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon really has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended consequences. You need to look at both. In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would set the program back by perhaps two years. That an American attack would be more effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years. It wouldn't prevent it, but it would slow it down. What about the unintended consequences? Well, most people are concerned about the possibility of counter attacks. Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israeli nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks. But in many ways, the more dangerous response is, first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon, for nuclear deterrence. North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. Pakistan doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. And many in the world and in Iran will come around to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon. A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so far has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets, international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales. And as a result, Iran gains access to the world economy. It breaks out of its isolation. And even perhaps certainly gains access to sophisticated military technology. In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't Russia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused to sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others, North Korea. I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it that we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran. And I think Jeff has pretty much answered that question. It's not Iranian invasion. It's Iranian subversion. It's Iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against their own regimes in many cases and against Israel. So it's Iranian influence; it's Iranian capacity for subversion. It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening states and invade Israel. That is a concern. And the fear is that they would be emboldened, and they'd do more of this. But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence with these dissident populations? Not with governments, but with dissident populations in places like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states. An Iran that had nuclear weapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack? Which of those two would give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations? I think the answer to that is fairly clear. Now, the argument that Iran would be emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger. But it's far from a certainty. It's not the historic pattern. You know, our major problems with the Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons. You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons. We had nuclear weapons, they didn't. China actually attacked the United States and Korea and made a two-year war with the United States and Korea. They didn't have nuclear weapons; we did. Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have anymore wars. Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused. Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a certain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, North Korea's relations with South Korea. There haven't been conflicts in either case. So the argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're not engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing, you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing? And I think the answer is not much.

Our motion is that Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. And now our final debater who will be speaking against the motion, Shmuel Bar. He is the director of studies at the Institute of Policy and Strategy in Herzliya. He is also a senior research fellow for the international institute for nonproliferation studies. Shmuel, you can start making your way to the lectern. He served for 30 years in the Israeli government, in the Israel defense forces intelligence and in the office of the prime minister. Ladies and gentlemen, Shmuel Bar.
Israel can live with nuclear Iran|i2Debates/011613 israel iran.p|44|R2|SHMUEL BAR|against|4|51|22|0|0|91|1|114|2|1|23|17|198|76|0|14|29|0|1|4|0|656|14|0|4|1|2|2|60|0|0|16|101|3|0|16|24|2|0|4|37|16|15|45|130|103|163|29|125|0|2|7|0|0|68|61|0|20|13|32|170|18|1|8|49|1108|Thank you. First of all, I won't go into the post-fact scenarios that were brought, but suffice to say that I could offer more optimistic scenarios. When you shuffle a deck of cards, then you play a completely new game. I recall that when we took out the Iraqi reactor we thought it would delay it for three years. But it took about 10 years, and the Iraqis did not get back to the level that they were before we took out the Osirak. Now, the arguments that have brought up the rational actor model, which I've already made some remarks as a historian about and the idea that deterrence works, and the other, the Cold War paradigm can be applied. I would argue that we have to look at both of these assumptions in a completely different manner. First of all, the rational actor model. Somebody, not me, McNamara, said that Castro was a rational man, Khrushchev was a rational man, Kennedy was a rational man. And three rational men almost brought their nations into utter destruction. And that was without any -- I mean, Che Guevara said that if Cuba had to be destroyed in order to destroy capitalism, then Cuba would be thankful for that. But in other words, rational people sometimes do things, or the dynamics between rational people, rational leaders, sometimes leads to things which are not rational. The other thing is that strategic surprises have happened. I don't think there's anybody here who would debate the fact that strategic surprises have happened. And when they happen, they happen because things that hordes of analysts and pundits and journalists have said are completely impossible because it is irrational that people will act that way, but they happened. So the fact is that these surprises happen, and they reflect dynamics which were not pure game theory rational behavior. Now, the other thing is that if nuclear weapons make countries more responsible, then I would propose that the United States, which wants to reduce its nuclear arsenal, should now just divvy out all of the American nuclear weapons to the whole world, and then everybody will become very responsible, very rational, and peace on earth and goodwill towards men. Now to the Cold War paradigm. The Cold War paradigm, let's define what it was. It was bilateral. It was a paradigm which, from a certain stage, had mutually assured destruction, with each party having a second-strike capability. It was with levels of intelligence that when these -- both the United States and Soviet Union acquired that capability, the second-strike capability, they also had satellites in the sky, so they had a reasonable picture of what was going on in the silos of their respective enemies. There were mutual communications after Cuba, and there was also a perception of a taboo after Hiroshima. Now, when we're talking about a nuclear Iran, we have to understand we are talking about a poly-nuclear Middle East. The nuclear Shiite Iran is going to be perceived by the Sunni countries as something that cannot be countenanced, that they are going to have to acquire their own nuclear weapons. In a poly-nuclear Middle East where every country has a very small arsenal, they do not have mutually assured destruction. They have sort of arsenal which is "Use it or lose it. If we are attacked then we won't have a second chance. We are going to have multiple nuclear states with these small arsenals with very low levels of intelligence. They won't have satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemy are. The size of the arsenals, it's better to have a lot of bombs than a few bombs because then, of course, you have the propensity to say, "Well, if I don't use it now, I won't have a second chance. " But then I want to go into something which has to do with command and control. And this is a very esoteric area. But in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclear weapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what's called "escalation dominance," you have to have very sophisticated capabilities. When you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of the Middle East and the paradigms which existed in the Cold War countries, you actually discover that most of the key elements which were instrumental in preventing nuclear confrontation during the Cold War do not exist in the Middle East and cannot exist for various reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, et cetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the delivery systems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly to rush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which prevented unintentional use. So all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region. We're talking about a possibility that not because Khamenei gets up in the morning and says, "Oh, what a lovely day, isn't it a great day to drop a bomb? " but that because the Iranians do a nuclear alert, the Saudis don't know whether it's directed against them. Israel sees Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and Turkey on clear alert. Everybody goes on DEFCON, and things get out of hand because none of these countries have the capability to control this spiral of escalation. Now we're talking about something which is -- even if we say it's low probability, but low probability, high consequence, and this is where we stand on that. In other words, we can say, "Oh, there's a 10 percent possibility that this will result in nuclear confrontation. " Well, 10 percent probability of total destruction is something that you have to think about. So, putting all of that together, I think that I would agree with McNamara that rational actors or rational leaders do not guarantee complete rational processes. And as a final note, we also have to address the issue of the taboo of nuclear weapons. Religious experts in Iran and in the Sunni world all ask themselves, "What is a nuclear bomb? " Since there can be nothing which the prophet Muhammad didn't speak about, they have decided that a nuclear bomb is like a catapult, it's just a big catapult, because a catapult used to be thrown over the walls of a city and you didn't see who it killed so it's indiscriminate killing. Well, that's like a nuclear weapon. I think that somebody who sees a nuclear weapon like a catapult is --

And now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. We have two teams of two: James Dobbins and Reuven Pedatzur, who are arguing for the motion that "Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. " Their argument is that, much as the U.S. learned to live with a nuclear China, Israel can do the same, and it's not desirable, they're not saying that, but they're also saying it doesn't mean that the sky is necessarily falling. They portray Iran's leaders as not crazy as is sometimes claimed. They're saying that the Iranians will not want a nuclear war any more than the Israelis. And, by the way, they say that attacking Iran to destroy its nuclear program would only strengthen Iran's influence and make it harder to contain than ever. Jeffrey Goldberg and Shmuel Bar are arguing against the motion, saying the risks to Israel are unacceptable. They have not, in their statement, promoted an attack in Iran, which they point out is not the premise of the debate, but they are depicting drastic consequences for Israel if a state that hates it as much as the Iranians say they hate Israel would get its hands on a nuclear weapon. They say it would be a defeat for the good guys, it could set off an arms race in the region, nukes could reach terrorists' hands. And, bottom line, two or three bombs alone could destroy all of Israel. It's not the Cold War, folks, in that sense. So those are essentially the arguments that the two sides are making. I just want to start off the questions by getting to this notion of the moderating influence of having a nuclear weapon that Reuven Pedatzur talked about. He talked about the fact that when China -- when Mao got the bomb in 1964, that he became a lot less, quote, unquote, "crazy" in that sense that he was depicted and thought of in the west; that he became a lot more sober-minded as a geopolitical thinker and strategist, because -- presumably because of the stakes. And I just want to put that to the other side and take it to Jeffrey Goldberg first. The notion that -- and you addressed it a little bit in your response, but I would just like a little bit more detail in recognizing what this argument actually is, that things did change in China at that time. So take on that question, Jeffrey Goldberg.

I really -- I don't want to stretch this to the breaking point, and I feel like that does stretch it to the breaking point. Yes, it's possible. It's possible that Iran will become suddenly a responsible party, but it is revolutionary in nature. I think by the time China reached nuclear status, it had been -- it was growing into something. Iran's specific goal is to export the Islamic revolution throughout the Muslim world; its specific goal is to destroy Israel; its specific role is to liberate Bahrain. A country that has all of these goals which gains a nuclear weapon is not going to suddenly say, "All right, now that we have the weapon that will finally allow us to do all of the things that we've been telling you we want to do, we're not going to do it. "

We're talking about the Iranians, that they're irrational. Let's talk about Khomeini; he was very extremist, right? In 1980, when the war with Iran began, Iraq did, he said that he'll never sign a cease-fire agreement with Iraq until they surrendered. In '88, they started launching missiles, conventional missiles, in Tehran, thousands people dead. And he signed an agreement, because the price was too high. And we are talking about conventional missiles, not nuclear missiles.

Let me answer the question by saying I don't necessarily think that Ayatollah Khamenei is going to, one day, wake up and decide to launch a preemptive nuclear strike on Israel because he wants to destroy Israel. What I'm much more concerned about is accidental escalation leading to all-out nuclear war. Think of it this way -- think of it this way: what happened two months ago? Hamas fires rockets into Israel, Israel fires back, Hamas escalates, Israel then escalates. Imagine if Iran was in the picture with a nuclear weapon, right? Now, just imagine this: Imagine that Iran, in response to Israel's escalation, decides to move war heads closer to their missile launching sights. And the American satellites see this. You'll be living in a Middle East of launch on warning. You'd be living in a situation in which the Israeli prime minister is going to say the Iranians are moving their missiles to strike us in defense of Hamas. What do I do?

We had 24,000 nuclear weapons locked in on us. They would have damaged us just as badly as half a dozen on Israel. The result would have been the same. And it probably would have been worse for the rest of the world; indeed it would have been catastrophic for the world as a whole. And we lived with that for 40 years. And all of these problems with launch on warning -- now, I quite take the fact that these regimes don't have the controlled mechanisms, the command and control or even the technologies that will make this a safer world. And so I fully acknowledge that there's an element of risk there. I fully acknowledge that Israel shouldn't live with a nuclear Iran if there's a better option. I'm just arguing that there may not be a better option.

Khomeini, two years after the Iraqi invasion of Iran, he could have signed an agreement. He could have stopped the war, but he continued with the war. And the reason that he finally agreed to a ceasefire was because the revolutionary guards actually imposed it on him. The other thing is that Iran isn't like China which was going through a process when it acquired nuclear weapons. China was already moderating its revolutionary zeal. Iran is going through what we would call the second generation of the revolution. I mean, we're already in this sort of Robespierre style second generation of the Iranian revolution going back to the pure concepts of the revolution. Now, but that really isn't the real issue here. The real issue here, I think, is that analogies are absolutely irrelevant. You never walk into the same stream in the same place twice. And certainly when one stream is in China and the other is in the Middle East. Secondly, the dynamics of multilateral nuclear states is completely different to the dynamics of two main .

And most of the Cold War was clearly a Warsaw Pact against NATO. It was clearly bilateral. So the fact that nominally you also have Britain and France, et cetera, and you have China, that did not make it multilateral. So it doesn't matter, though, because we're not talking -- and as a historian, I find it difficult to discuss analogies because we think that stories tend to think that God is in the details. And the details on the Middle East is that we will have a poly-nuclear Middle East where we will have a Sunni world which is going to see a Shiite nuclear power as an existential threat to the Sunni world. Anybody who's read the best seller in Saudi Arabia, "The Protocols of the Elders of Qom," which tells how the elders of Qom wanted to destroy Mecca and Medina, realize that they see this as existential as well. And so we have to understand that this is the situation. This situation does not auger well for stability.

It's not that the Israelis should go away. It's that Israel should go away and that a multi-ethnic state encompassing both Palestinians and Israelis should continue to exist. Interestingly enough, there are extremists, but viable parties in Israel who also think that the Israeli state should encompass all of the West Bank.

But then they also say, as the a toll laws say, all the Jews who aren't from there have to go back to where they're from, which leads to these incredible statements, and I heard this from many Iranian officials --

We're trying to debate a -- a little bit of it has been put before - - as the day after, what would be the consequences for Israel of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. And so as you're getting ready to do that, I just want to go back to the side that's arguing that Israel cannot live with a nuclear weapon and point out that your opponent, Jim Dobbins, made the point that -- he asked "What actually would the Iranians be able to start doing that they're not already doing in terms of killing Jews around the world, and in terms of encouraging attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah, and being generally mischievous and deadly? What would be different if they had a nuclear weapon? Jeff Goldberg.

There was one option that the United States would lose if Iran had a nuclear weapon, which it's lost with respect to North Korea, and that is to invade and overthrow the regime. That would be off the table. We might do other things to them. We've got 5,000 nuclear weapons. They've got two or three. There's almost nothing we could do to them, short of threatening to overthrow the regime, which would cause them to use their nuclear weapons. And I think Israel has never had the capacity of invading and overthrowing the regime, and Israel's not going to use its nuclear weapons to respond to rocket attacks from Hamas. It's got other conventional responses to that which it can fall back on whether Iran has nuclear weapons or not. And Iran is not going to start a nuclear war to protect Hamas.

They actually have only been used for deterrence in a very limited case that we know of, the Cold War, but nuclear weapons can be used for compellence. And if you imagine Iran having a certain window of opportunity when the rest of the Middle East has not acquired nuclear weapons, and they do have an agenda. The Iranians are making it clear -- actually, they've escalated their rhetoric about Bahrain being part of Iran which was stolen by the Brits. They will probably take advantage of it to brandish nuclear weapons as a means of compellence in order to get the level of hegemony in the gulf and in the Middle East before the rest of the countries do acquire nuclear weapons.

It's a risk, like these other things. And it's a risk that the U.S. takes seriously, which is one of the reasons why it's threatened to bomb Iran. It's not as if there's a gulf between the Israeli leadership and the leadership in Washington; they both agree that they should bomb Iran rather than allow it to have nuclear weapons, they just disagree about when.

I'll probably the one who turns off the lights at Ben-Gurion Airport. But I think it is absolutely ridiculous and absurd to compare a situation in which a country which has declared that it wants to exterminate the state of Israel, has nuclear weapons, as opposed to the balance which existed post Cuba between the United States and the Soviet Union, even though they both had nuclear weapons. It's -- you can make those analogies, but they have absolutely nothing to do with reality.

Quanta Ahmed. I'm a Muslim author. To my colleagues, Mr. Bar and Mr. Goldberg, I would say what's different and what you're arguing clearly is that the new ingredient is virulent political Islamism, which both of you have touched upon, which changes the equation, not just the poly-nuclear conflict. I think that's what makes this so much more dangerous than anything history's previously seen in terms of the Cold War. Would you agree? And could you expand?

And yet it hasn't behaved irresponsibly in the sense of doing anything that endangers its existence. The regime has done lots of outrageous things. But none of them threatened its existence. None of them threatened the continuity of the regime. Iran in fact hasn't invaded anybody for 500 years. So it's not as if they have territorial claims. They're promoting subversion. They're promoting overthrow of hostile regimes. They're engaging in terrorism. And I would anticipate that they would continue to do so. At no point has either American or Israeli nuclear weapons deterred them from that. I don't think there's any level of that that they could engage in that would result in a nuclear strike on our part. And therefore, I don't think that their having nuclear weapons would particularly affect that kind of behavior, which would -- we would continue to have to respond to forcefully at times and certainly rigorously. But I don't think it would be notably harder.

And so I do think you have to take into account -- not just with Islam, but with -- as I said before, fundamentalist Jewish parties in Israel I wouldn't want to see controlling nuclear weapons. We're entering the age of political Islamism in the Middle East. The Muslim Brotherhood is in charge of Egypt today. In another year, it's going to be in charge of Syria. I'll answer this question with a question to the audience in a way, which is, would you be comfortable having the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt be in control of nuclear weapons? Would you be comfortable having the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria be in charge of nuclear weapons? And for that matter, would you -- would you be happy if the chief rabbis of Israel had nuclear weapons?

Many times the supreme leader has made a distinction between Zionism and Judaism. And many of the people in the regime have often said that they have nothing against Judaism. They have a Jewish MP; there's a very large synagogue that covers about four blocks in Tehran; you see many Jews -- not many, but I would say you see a few Jews going around, you know, with their distinct caps --

They want to deny the Jewish people their right to a Jewish homeland and a Jewish state. They threaten to use violence and use violence to do that. I'm sure some of Ayatollah Khamenei's best friends are Jews. And I'm sure that people walk around the streets of Tehran with kippot on. I would point out that, yes, there's a synagogue open in Tehran, when Natan Sharansky and the refuseniks were in jail in the Soviet Union, there were five synagogues open in Moscow. It's not relevant. The vast majority of Iranian Jews have fled the country. There was a population of 200,000. They're down to 25,000 now. It's not relevant. The Iranian regime is very happy to have their Jews living in protected second-class status, and that's the way that they like it. That's the Iranian regime. The Iranian people, by the way, are not anti- Semitic on the whole, but the regime most definitely is. I can cite you quote, after quote, after quote to show you that they have -- they take almost an epidemiological -- they use epidemiological metaphors to talk about the curse of international Jewry. You know, these are not people who want compromise on the West Bank. These are people who want the Jewish people denied their right to have a homeland in at least part of their historic homeland.

I just want to preface this by saying that as a young man I had an opportunity to study for a year at the Hebrew University, very impressionable year. And recently I've had two opportunities to visit Iran for conferences there. And the question is really that Iran could be our natural ally -- is our natural ally in the region. You know, if there were 10 years of dtente, the theocrats would be thrown out and there would be massive change. Also the --

You're asking this question, I'm asking you if you feel that you're -- would you amend it to say that even under a nuclear Iran things could change, that times could -- the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would render irrelevant Iran's possession of the nuclear weapon as it relates to Israel's survival?

I read what is written in Iran. I read the material coming out of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. I have no doubt that most -- you know, Iran is probably the most pro-American country in the Middle East after Israel, but it doesn't really matter, because, you know, you may have noticed that not everywhere in the world does the public opinion of the people rule the country. There are many, many countries in the world, not only North Korea and places like that, where people may think one thing and the regime is something else. And the more dictatorial the regime is, and the easier it is to make sure that what people want isn't what they get. The Iranian poet Saadi once wrote that the sultan is evil and you must get rid of him and you must destroy him, but if you cannot kill him -- you cannot cut off his hand, kiss it. And this is basically what has happened to the revolution in Iran. So -- to the green revolution. Now, yes, it is possible that over a period of decades eventually Iran will get back to being, you know, a friend of America, a friend of everybody, and was a friend of Israel, was an ally of Israel. But what happens in between? And what does a regime do when it has a nuclear weapon and it does everything in order to enhance its position and to make sure that by enhancing its position abroad it can also put down its opposition at home, because who would dare intervene in Iran when Iran can do that sort of mischief abroad?

It's not going to threaten to use nuclear weapons against the Iranian opposition, so I don't think it's likely to have a major impact. It might have some short-term psychological impact, but it -- you know, I mean, the United States successfully waged a war that got -- that three the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan employing Pakistani and Afghan surrogates. The Soviets had nuclear weapons, they were completely useless. They got defeated in Afghanistan despite the fact that they had 24,000 nuclear weapons.

A question for Mr. Dobbins. You've talked about Israel dealing with uncertainties rather than certainties. My question is, can you give us some metrics by which Israel can calibrate an appropriate reaction ? And also, can you give us some historical examples of how other countries have dealt with existential threats and what levels of uncertainty has been acceptable versus a precursor to a swift response?

Israel can live with nuclear Iran|i2Debates/011613 israel iran.p|362|R3|JAMES DOBBINS|for|4|9|5|0|0|15|0|26|0|0|8|0|47|15|0|7|12|0|0|0|0|142|5|0|0|0|0|7|12|0|0|2|14|0|0|2|6|0|0|7|1|0|4|18|32|27|33|3|19|0|0|0|0|0|11|11|0|8|1|6|36|4|0|3|11|234|Well, you know, I'm not sure that one can calculate exact levels of risk. I would certainly acknowledge that the risk of miscalculation and a nuclear exchange is higher if the countries have nuclear weapons than if they don't. It's high enough to be very concerned about. And so, going back to my proposition, Israel shouldn't have to live with a nuclear Iran if it has a better choice. I'm just arguing that there aren't better choices necessarily than those that we're already pursuing. I mean, I will get into whether it's relevant or not, but a whole literature on the concepts of deterrence, on means of deterrence, on mutual signaling, on avoiding escalatory instability by making sure that you weren't subject to a first strike, and thus tempting your adversary to make that first strike in rising tensions. There are ways that one can minimize the risk of escalation by the way one constructs and hides and disposes of one's nuclear forces. There are technical ways that one can avoid unauthorized use of these kinds of weapons. And there's a long history of literature on that. The United States, for instance, has sought to help Pakistan establish physical mechanisms and procedures that would make an unauthorized or accidental launch of a nuclear weapon more difficult. I'm not suggesting we necessarily get into such a relationship with Iran, but we might hope someone did.

And this is their last chance to try to influence your vote. Immediately after their closing statements, we'll have our second vote. And remember, it's the team that has moved your numbers the most in the course of the debate who will be declared our winner. Onto round three, closing statements. Our motion is, Israel can live with a nuclear Iran.

I want to just tell a very brief story. In 1998, I was in Afghanistan, in Kandahar when Osama Bin Laden issued his first fatwa, the first big fatwa, the fatwa against crusaders and Jews. And I was with a bunch of people, westerners, and we heard about this. And frankly, we laughed about it because it seemed crazy, absolutely insane, the audacity of it. And, you know, I learned three years later that very often when someone who says something that seems crazy, says it over and over again, that it's worth paying attention to. And so on my visits to Iran, and I've been there a few times, I've talked to people in the regime about these subjects. I'll tell you one very brief encounter I had with a guy named Mohammed Ali Samadi who was a leader of a group called the Seekers of Martyrdom, which actually sounds like a great name for a band, actually. But their job at the time was to try to figure out how to kill Salman Rushdie. And -- but I talked to him about Israel. And he said the following, which has always stayed with me. There are always infections and diseases in man. In the world, there is an infection called international Jewry. And I listened to him, and I listened to various leaders of the regime. And I have decided to take them seriously. I think in the post 9/11 age, we have to take religious fundamentalists who say they want to kill you seriously. I think it is possible to overlearn the lessons of Jewish history, to overlearn the lessons of the holocaust. But I'm even more afraid of underlearning the lessons of Jewish history. I believe that the Iranian regime is serious about wanting to find a way to destroy the state of Israel. I believe that if they get a nuclear weapon, they will go a great distance to achieving that goal. And therefore, I ask you to vote against this resolution, vote against this motion. Thank you.

So I tried. Anyway, I understand the arguments of the other side. It's very frightening to live under this shade of this hostile regime with nuclear weapons. I have no illusions. The Ayatollahs are not lovers of Zion. But they are very rational, and they want to survive, and they want to their country. And at the end, they are not going to use the weapons. We can live with nuclear Iran. I live in Tel Aviv. This is the center of the target. And I didn't ask my four daughters and my grandchildren to leave Israel, because I believe that we can live in Israel and survive more than three years. In the '50s, at the end of the '50s when there was the threat of the Soviet Union, people in the States started building atomic shelters in their back yards. And Kennedy ran for president promising that he is going to build atomic shelters for the whole population. I hope that we are not going to start building atomic shelters in Tel Aviv. A nuclear Iran is not the end of Zionism. Thank you.

I want to just reiterate that rationality of every single individual involved in a conflict is not a guarantee that the conflict will end or will develop in a rational manner or in a way which everybody will be happy with. In the end, history shows us that a lot of things happened which everybody's sorry about, that it's bad for everybody. Now, you know, we talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis, et cetera. Actually, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, all of these rational people were very, very close to Armageddon, which was, according to the capabilities of that period. During the Cold War, there were a number of instances where the United States and the Soviet Union, with all of their command and control capabilities, with all of their intelligence, actually came to some very, very dangerous points, which were avoided because the leaderships had a means of communication. Now, the level of hostility in the Middle East does not augur well for direct communications between -- not even -- not only Israel-Iran, but Iran-Saudi Arabia, and we're talking about a Middle East in which countries are falling apart, and that some countries may acquire the nuclear weapons that they will inherit from the countries which are disintegrating. We're talking about a region which is -- I call this the "Humpty Dumpty stage," that they're falling apart and nobody would put them together again -- this is a very dangerous area to have nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the question is not, "Well, can you do anything about it? If you can't do anything about it, live with it," but "You have to do something about it. You've got to find a way. " And, believe me, there are more than one ways to skin a cat, even a Persian cat.

And, you know, sirens would go off, and we would hide under our desks, so, you know, some level of fear and concern is natural enough in a society that faces that kind of threat. And if you can avoid the threat, by all means, do so if you have a better choice. We didn't have a better choice at the time. Reuven has suggested that a nuclear Iran will not be the end of the Jewish state. And I'd have to say most Israelis agree with him. The Times of Israel published a poll last week, a poll done in the context of their election campaign, in which they asked the Israeli populace what were the issues that most -- that created most anxiety, what were they most worried about. Was Iran the number one issue? No. Economic issues were their dominant concern. Was Iran the number two issue? No. Actually, and perhaps rather healthily, the deterioration in relations with the Palestinians was the number two concern. Was Iran the number three concern? No. The third concern was the state of their education system. Iran was the fourth in this list of six, with 12 percent of the Israeli population thinking that the Iranian threat was their principal concern.

We're asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat as you did at the beginning of the debate.

And we'll have the results of that vote in just about a minute. Okay. Before we do that, I want to do this. It's a contentious topic tonight. I think it was done in a very, very civil and constructive way. Certain things were declared irrelevant repeatedly. And maybe they were, but I want to congratulate our debaters for the quality of debate -- I also want to thank people who asked questions this evening, and that includes the questions that I did not take. I want to make it clear that if I pass on a question it is not meant as a disrespect in any way or a sign that the question is invalid or unsound. I particularly liked your question. In fact, about -- what is their -- Iran going to do about nuclear Israel? Someday we're going to have that debate.

I just felt that we had covered it. But I basically want to say let's give a round of applause to everybody with the nerve to get up and ask a question tonight. So thank you for tolerating my occasionally vanishing laryngitic voice tonight. It will be better at the next debate, which will be Wednesday, February 13th. We will be looking at this motion: prohibit genetically engineered babies. It's based on the fact that we already screen for genetic diseases, and the ability to choose a child's color and intelligence is, actually, not so far off. We want to look, basically, at the policy and the ethics implied in that manifestation of a brave new world. Our debaters will include, for the motion, arguing to prohibit: Sheldon Krimsky. He is the chair of the Center for Responsible Genetics and professor of humanities and social sciences at Tufts University. He will be partnered with Lord Robert Winston. He is a pioneer in fertility and IVF treatment and professor of science and society at Imperial College. Arguing against: Nita Farahany. She is a professor of law and genome sciences at Duke, also a member of the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues. And her partner will be Lee Silver. And Lee Silver is a professor of molecular biology and public policy at Princeton University. Tickets for our spring season debates are available right now through our website, www.iq2us.org.

You can also listen to the debates, this one included, on NPR and watch them on PBS stations across the country. Just check your local listings for air dates and times. We'd also love it if you tweeted about tonight's debate. Even if you haven't, you can go home and do it now. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US and our hashtag for this evening's debate in particular is @IsraelIran. All right, the results are in. Okay, so remember, we've had you vote twice and the team whose numbers move by the largest percentage point is declared our winner. So let's find out who you decided won this debate. The motion: Israel can live with a nuclear Iran. Before the debate, in polling you in the live audience, 25 percent of you agreed with the motion, 35 percent were against it, and 40 percent were undecided. So the final results -- remember, the winner is the team that has changed the numbers the most from the first vote to the second. The second vote now. The team arguing for the motion: they went from 25 percent to 37 percent. That is a 12 percent increase; that is the number to beat. Now, let's look at the team against the motion. They went from 35 percent to 55 percent. They went up 20 percent, that's the winning side. The team arguing against the motion "Israel can live with a nuclear Iran" has won our debate. That's it for this time. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

It was his feeling that this is one debate where the richness of the debate actually comes from the fact that there are an awful lot of shades of gray and shades of meaning in the issue, that black and white and yes or no, even though we're asking you to vote at that level, it's very complicated. And so he was looking forward to this being, in a sense, one of the more complex debates that we were going to have and have ever staged. So with that thought, let's please welcome our debaters to the stage. Thank you. Thank you. And because we're being broadcast for radio and television, there are various points throughout the evening where we like the radio audience in particular to know that you, our live audience, are here. So you can absolutely give voice. This is not like a presidential debate where you're not allowed to applaud. You can give voice to your passions in this. You can laugh, cheer, react however you want to. We just want it to not be mean spirited. We discourage you from hissing, for example. But -- but a chuckle like that is fine. And here and there, again, I'm just going to ask you to applaud entirely spontaneously, but it has to be when I ask you. To work for the radio broadcast. And when I introduce, in a moment, each of our debaters, the first time I mention their name, I'll do a little of this, and that means, please welcome these -- these debaters with a round of applause. But let's just begin the whole thing, please. Welcome them to the stage one more time. So most of us would do almost anything for our kids to help them be their best, to help them get ahead. But what if even before they were born we could go in and alter their genes in such a way to give them an even greater advantage, to give them strength against illness and disease, to make them smarter or taller or prettier even if their parents themselves never had any of those traits. Well, that world is coming. Who's tempted? And who is horrified? Let's find out.

And, Sheldon, you are a professor at Tufts University and chair of the Council for Responsible Genetics. Your research has focused on the intersection of science, ethics, and public policy. Your very first book in this area was published in 1982. It was a social history of what was then considered a very, very controversial new technology, "gene splicing," 30 years ago, which could lead to the mistake that you are a geneticist, but actually you are a philosopher.

Thank you very much. The proposition before us today, to me means prenatal genetic modification of human reproductive cells, like sperm or eggs or fertilized eggs, called the zygote, in preparation for gestation in the womb and development to full term infants should be prohibited at the societal level, and to this I agree firmly. The two basic reasons to carry out such an intervention: one, for curing or preventing genetic disease; or, two, for the enhancement of a person. For genetic diseases, in the great majority of cases there are simpler, less risky, less costly, less ethically controversial, and more dependable methods of preventing the birth of a child with a severe genetic abnormality by using prenatal embryo diagnosis; that is, for diagnosing the embryos. There are a couple of exceptions, which I think we will get to during this debate, such as mitochondrial disease. And we'll have more to say about that later. Other than the exception, the only sensible rationale for engaging in genetic modification of the fertilized egg is for the enhancement of a child. Enhancement might include intelligence, resistance to disease, greater height, muscle strength, appealing personality, longevity, any number of things you could imagine. Now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive cells, for enhancement is where I find the greatest moral failure and the greatest scientific folly. I offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their health. No set of animal studies can ensure the safety and efficacy of human prenatal genetic modification. It is unimaginable that any humane, democratic society would permit such a trial with public or private funds; the risk would so outweigh the societal benefits. My distinguished colleague, professor Winston, will address some of the risks, complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early embryo. Of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and knowledge gained are of no concern. So that certainly can always happen. This takes us to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two. Traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and -- are complex and not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the DNA and the gene- gene interactions that occur in human cells. Scientists and the so-called trans- humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a Lego set, where pieces of DNA can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of the system. Actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts interrelate and are in mutual balance. Even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50 genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples. So there could be hundreds of genes associated with height. If you want a child, a tall child, marry tall. Finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human perfection can be directed by genetics. The danger is not so much that it will work, but as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you better. It would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a Nobel laureate will give you a genius child. I am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral education. Enhancement through genetic engineering of human germ plasm is a fool's paradise and will lead to no good. Thank you.

I'd like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation for airing this important debate, our moderate for John Donvan and my esteemed colleagues in this debate. I am here tonight to represent my personal views, and not the President's Commission on Bioethics of which I am a member, about why we should not prohibit genetically engineered babies. In a little while, you'll hear from my debate partner, Lee Silver, who will debunk many of the scientific claims against genetic engineering. But first I want to convince of you two things: that we already can and have safely genetically engineered babies and that a middle ground of prudent vigilance, public oversight and debate about genetic engineering is better than prohibition. I also want to call your attention to the resolution this evening. It calls for an outright and complete ban on genetic engineering of babies. If Lee and I can convince you of any instance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should vote against the resolution. Throughout the evening, I'll defend why genetic engineering is no different in kind from the many ways that we already engineer our children, from the partners we choose to prenatal screening to the supplements we take that impact our children and their fates. Recently new research shows the powerful effect of taking folate during pregnancy and how it reduces the incidence of autism in children. And yet no one thinks that we should ban folate. But I want to convince you that we already can and have taken the next step of genetic engineering of babies and that we would take a drastic step backwards to ban outright that technology. I'm going to tell you about inherited mitochondrial disorders, which are progressive and cause tragic health consequences. A little biology 101 should help frame the debate. About 98 percent of your DNA is nuclear DNA. It codes for much of who you are. But about 2 percent of your DNA is mitochondrial which supplies the energy to your cells. To understand this, visualize a cell with its small nucleus and a little bundle inside of the cell and the mitochondrial DNA and the fluid that surrounds it. The nucleus of the cell is where 99.9 percent of the action is, but only in the mitochondria functions properly. About one in 5,000 babies born have problems with their mitochondrial DNA that cause rare but incredibly serious disease, including heart failure, dementia, blindness, severe suffering and death. There is no way to treat the condition once it is acquired, and it is extremely difficult to predict how severely a child will be affected. With genetic engineering of babies, we can altogether avoid this suffering. Professors Winston and Krimsky will argue that we can just screen out and abort the defective fetuses or destroy the embryos in the lab. But mitochondrial DNA, which is solely inherited from the mother, is often passed on to every child of an afflicted mother. Only genetic engineering can safeguard a woman against these difficult choices and altogether eliminate the risk of a child being born with mitochondrial disease. Take, for example, Sharon, a woman who had a healthy pregnancy and who gave birth to a beautiful, healthy girl. Twenty-eight hours later, that baby died of an unknown disease. This tragic tale repeated itself five times as each of Sharon's babies lived for just a few hours. Only her son, Edward survived. And by age four, he started falling over repeatedly. He'll spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair with little control over his muscles. You see, Sharon has Lee's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease, and she passed it on to all six of her children. The only way that Sharon or any woman with a high level of mitochondrial abnormality will have her own healthy genetic children is through genetic engineering of the babies. We'll talk about two techniques to do so: Pronuclear transfer and maternal spindle transfer that safely eliminate the risk of these diseases. At least 30 children have already been born in the United States using an earlier version of mitochondrial transfer. All of these children were born free of mitochondrial disease. And these newer techniques have even fewer risks than those earlier ones and promise even better outcomes for future generations. The United Kingdom, notoriously conservative about reproductive technologies, has given the green light in the use of these technologies. A ban by the U.S. would make us an outlier, a country standing in the way of scientific progress, at odds with the scientific and ethical consensus that mitochondrial transfer, a form of genetic engineering of babies, is permissible. But mitochondrial genetic engineering proves my larger point that I want to convince you of this evening, that a middle ground approach is better than an outright ban. You'll hear my opponents talking about opening floodgates to a dystopia of designing perfect babies. But technology itself is not evil. Only misuse and misapplication of it is. The public can and should decide what limits if any there should be on the uses of genetic engineering. But a complete ban would just drive the practice into back alleys or overseas. Criminalizing genetic engineering will make the practice hidden from public view so that we will have no idea whether Sharon and women like her are using unsafe and unsavory practitioners to carry out genetic engineering. Reproductive tourism is already rampant, where women and couples are traveling to foreign countries to gain access to reproductive technologies banned in their own countries. You can be sure that women like Sharon, afflicted with terrible Lee's syndrome, will travel great distances to safeguard their children. Now imagine just for a moment how we would enforce the outright ban that the resolution calls for. Would we forcibly genetically test all babies? Would they -- would the government appear in Sharon's hospital room or at airports with handcuffs to arrest her or her child? Would we forcibly sterilize Sharon and her baby? Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Some of the worst examples of abuses of government power in the last century have involved the government trying to control our reproduction. This grim history of eugenics and of laws against interracial marriage, of programs of forced sterilization and abortion, provide a strong reason to reject the resolution. We aren't here to defend every type of genetic engineering. We're here to urge you to vote in favor of a middle ground, to allow parents and private citizens to make private choices about one of the most intimate decisions they will ever make, to bring a healthy child into the world.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is actually quite a simple proposition. And it's quite clear that what our opponents are recommending is something which Americans shiver at, which is experimentation without the consent of the individual being experimented upon. It's worth looking very briefly at American history. The history of eugenics, which started probably in Britain, with Francis Galton back in the 1850s, is still a scar to some extent on genetics. And Davenport, of course, and other people who followed him, I think, had a great deal of responsibility for the sterilization of women without consent, with the prevention of people who might want to make love together because they were different races were prevented by law in many states in the United States. And this is something, of course, which directly influenced the Nazi holocaust. And although it may seem farfetched, it's worth bearing in mind that the time when the planet is oppressed by the risk of global warming, and by the risk of conflict, by the risk of all sorts of serious issues on the economy, it may well be that people might want to see eugenics raising its ugly head again. And the United States, in my view, as the leading biotechnological country in the world, has a major responsibility to lead it in this ethical issue. Now, as my partner has said, there are two concerns here. One is genetic engineering to change horrific genes such as these are mentioned, and the other, of course, is to enhance individuals. The problem, of course, is that once you go from one, I think you go to the other as well. And mitochondrial disease, let's just knock that on the head straightaway. Mitochondrial disease, although it's a terrible thing to have, it is really trivial in terms of its incidence. It's a very, very uncommon disorder. And it is worrying to me that our opponents have got the numbers wrong. It isn't 2 percent of the DNA, it's 16,000 base pairs out 3 billion base pairs. So it's a tiny amount of DNA, but we know already that even fiddling with the mitochondria may make a massive difference to what happens to the nuclear DNA. It's still not clear. And it's worth bearing in mind that abnormal children have been born as a result of mitochondrial transfer. This has been completely unpredictable. Now, with regard to one of the issues about genetic engineering for enhancement, it will be permanent, it will be irreversible, and it may impart values to a child that, that child might find is not valuable in the society in which they are growing up. And, of course, with regard to disease, it is quite clear that screening embryos is a much better bet. If we take a cell away or the look at the biochemistry of an embryo, which you can now do, and detect the disease, we can simply substitute that embryo for another one in a clutch of eggs because, of course, a woman -- it's worth bearing in mind that the average childbearing woman watching this program will lose two eggs during the course of the program, each genetically unique. The males, meanwhile, have made some 70,000 new sperm. Each of those are equally genetically unique, an every embryo is different. And therefore, to screen embryos which have a clear disease, by the techniques which are now being developed, is certainly possible and much safer than meddling with the genome. And, of course, what we have to understand is that we now know that the environmental influence on the embryo, the environmental influence on the fetus has a massive point, has a massive change, in how it grows up. And, in fact, really, what we should be trying to do -- rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what we should be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the DNA functions in the best possible way. There is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, the intelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stress hormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning. And that is something which we should really recognize in a democratic society as something that science should really concentrate on. Now, the big problem of course is that genetic engineering is unpredictable. And I'm going to give you two examples from the two biggest users of people who make genetically modified animals. The most common place for genetically modified animals, of course, is in the pharmaceutical industry. Pretty well every drug is now tested -- nearly every drug will be tested on animals, where their genes have been modified to make a model for human disease or to look at the action of that drug. And if you look at the figures which are being published by two of the largest companies in the world, with very large series of mass models, you can see the problem you'd have with genetic engineering. AstraZeneca published 51 different models, a vast number of mice in those models, 70 percent, ladies and gentlemen, of those animals were abnormal and the abnormality was unpredictable. Some of the abnormalities were trivial, others were not. The animals were not followed up for long term, they were simply discarded, so we don't know what would have happened to -- in old age. We do know that changing genetics makes a difference to what happens to us in our old age, and certainly the fetal origins of adult disease are very important. We know, for example, that stroke, diabetes, some cancers, may be caused by what happens in the environment of an embryo early on. And Pfizer has gone even further. It's looked at 74 different tests on mice that are bred after genetic modification, and 50 percent of the mice failed the phenotype test. And this is without, of course, testing the very things for which we would want to enhance people, i.e., intelligence and their ability to solve a problem. So let's just say one other thing, if I may, and that is that one of the problems, of course, is that one may modify genes, but we don't even know whether they will continue to function in the way. And there is a lot of evidence from the work we do in my own laboratory, which shows that gene expression in a modified animal stops after a while during development. Ladies and gentlemen, as I say, you have a responsibility here. You have a duty to lead the world to make certain that your medicine is ethical. Thank you.

The proposition this evening is "prohibit genetically engineered babies. " Prohibit even if the purpose is to promote health; prohibit even if the recipients understand precisely the actual risk; prohibit even if it's safe; prohibit even if the technology is safer than doing nothing. I just need to convince you of one example of acceptability and you should vote to oppose the proposition. And my colleague has already talked very eloquently about mitochondrial DNA deficiency, and I'm going to go beyond that, because I hope to convince my opponents here to vote for my side of this proposition. They've both written and talked quite eloquently about the use of genetics to prevent disease. So what are we talking about here tonight when we talk about genetic engineering? Conceptually, it's very simple: genetic engineering will allow perspective parents to give their child genetic information that they themselves do not carry. That's how genetic engineering will first be used, not soon, but that's the way it's first going to be applied. And to understand what parents might want to give their children, we should examine the facts of genetics that have become available to us over the last five to ten years, have given us a very different perspective on the human genome than we had previously. And it revealed some unpleasant facts. I want you to look at the person sitting to the right of you. And if there's no one on the right, look at the person sitting to the left. That person and you differ at over a million locations in your DNA. Most of those differences don't do anything. But even if you're a healthy adult, at least 100 of those genetic variance can cause deadly childhood disease. Not in you, of course, because you're sitting in the audience. But in your grandchildren or their grandchildren. You carry thousands of other genetic variants, every one of you in this room, that impact your health and risk to thousands of diseases in different ways, including cancer and heart disease and neurological disease. And some of the variants that you carry are better than those of your neighbor to the right. Some are worse than those of your neighbor. And all in all, some of us are born with better health genes, and some are not. Now, if you have made a decision, you or a daughter, granddaughter, have made a decision to have a child, what do you hope for the most in that child? And Dr. Winston has spoken eloquently to this question many, many times. You hope for a healthy child. You'll love any child, but you hope for a healthy child. And Dr. Winston has also said, and I agree, in pluralistic societies like yours and mine, genetic selection against diseased embryos is a matter for the individuals concerned. If you agree with Dr. Winston on this point, it follows that you should be willing to accept genetic engineering when needed to accomplish the same goal. But, you might worry, doesn't this violate Mother Nature? Well, I'm here to tell you that Mother Nature doesn't care at all about you or your baby. Throughout the history of the human species, Mother Nature has engaged in all-out warfare against us with infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. And it's only in the last century that we gained the knowledge and power to fight back with vaccines and antibiotics and other medicines. Now, do some people abuse pharmaceutical drugs? Of course there is abuse out there. But that doesn't mean that we should prohibit medicine. With infectious diseases essentially vanquished in our society, although not everywhere in the world, the next target in our sights is Mother Nature's genetic wrath. Unfortunately, if you're in the audience, it's too late to do anything about the genome and the hundreds of trillions of cells in your body. But we can think about the future. You can think about your children's children and their children's children, because the expansive amount of knowledge we are gaining about the genome has flabbergasted even those of us who are most optimistic about this science. So let's think about the next generation or the generation after that. Now, Mother Nature is a metaphor, and it's a really bad metaphor because in reality, inheritance is a game of craps. You throw the dice, you hold your breath, you hope your child is healthy. It won't have to be that way in the future when we learn how to take the genetic dice, place them on the table in the way that is going to promote health most likely for the child to be. What about the risks? We've heard about the risks from both of the proponents of this proposition, the precautionary principle is often mentioned. You shouldn't deploy a technology until all of the unknowable risks are known. And we can't possibly understand how genes work because the whole system of life is very complex. And if we put a new gene in, it might have unattended consequences. And I agree with the proponents of the proposition. We don't understand genetics. It's very complex, and it's more complex the more we understand it. But what society and people can do in the future is consider genetic information that already exists in some people but not others. I want to focus your mind on the fact, as I said a moment ago, we all carry thousands of genetic variants, some of which are promoting health and some of which are not. And even if a variant is in just 1 percent of the population out there, we can study the effects of that genetic variant in the people who carry that variant. And we can see the benefits or not of that variant. So the precautionary principle is not in effect here. I want to conclude that if you are thinking about voting for this proposition, you'll need to explain why you did so when your daughter or granddaughter comes to you with the following question: "Dad, grandpa, why can't I give my child health-promoting, disease- preventing genes that other children get naturally? " If you can't answer that question, you must vote no on this proposition.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. And now we move on to round two. Round two is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and you in the audience. Our motion is "prohibit genetically engineered babies. " We have two teams of two arguing it. The team arguing for the prohibition include Sheldon Krimsky and Robert Winston. They have made an argument, as I hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally. The scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field. It is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made. The crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive. The Nazis fell for it with calamitous results. They're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now. The team arguing against the prohibition says, No. 1, it would be -- the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the United States will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen. And in terms of the complexity, we just heard that in fact there is a way to find a road map through this forest by studying what is known already, what is observed in the population, that it's not -- that there's not a way into this -- into this forest and a way out of it again. So I want to put questions to each of the sides in turn. And I want to begin with just this broad notion of the U.S. being left behind. Since we're talking about a prohibition, we're talking about, in that sense, something legal or regulatory. The side arguing against prohibition says the net result of that would be to leave the U.S. behind in something that is happening already, that this train has left the station. Sheldon Krimsky, can you respond to that?

We have all kind of moral provisions in the United States. We don't allow the sale of organs. We restrict certain types of uses of viruses in research. We prohibit certain experiments with animals that are considered immoral. We can always use that argument and say somebody will be left behind, but we have to establish moral principles and safety principles that make sense to our scientific community and our general society.

Unlike the U.S., things happen there with oversight, public oversight. This organization held a long inquiry inviting scientific and ethical input. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics likewise in the U.K. looked into mitochondrial DNA transfer. What they urged the U.K. to do is to green light this technology and go ahead.

And actually it's inhibited research. It's not a very good way of regulating. So I don't think you should hold up the British model. What is needed actually -- what I think is needed is a consensus amongst all of us that we act as far as we can ethically and in the best interest of patients, whatever that might mean.

The ethical way to proceed is to study a technology, to have an open public debate about a technology, to have scientific valid -- scientifically valid studies that are allowed to proceed. This technology is proceeding. This technology can save lives. It has saved lives. We would be taking a drastic step backward.

I don't know her personally. And I'm so happy that she had a successful pregnancy. But she had choices. One of her choices was to adopt someone else's egg and have a baby. She -- it wouldn't be her DNA but it would be somebody else's DNA. Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption. What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child? In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that "My child has to have my DNA. " She did have some other choices. The risks that she took were real.

They mostly talked about helping produce children who wouldn't have dreaded illnesses, conditions, and diseases.

They are amongst the worst kinds of diseases that people have. Children in the main die of genetic defects. A few of them like mitochondrial diseases don't always kill people but they often have major effects on the central nervous system. They're deeply unpleasant, and there's no question that if we could avoid these diseases, if we could prevent them or treat them more effectively, we should do so.

The safety issues that have to be taking care of this, institutional review boards. Now, if you were a woman who wanted such procedures to be done, one of the first questions you would ask is has this been done within a clinical trial setting, with the government's imprimatur, or is this being done at a hospital that has, really, no accountability to any national bioethics system? In fact, these experiments were done in violation of a de facto rule by the federal government, because they used private funds. So there is really not a good clinical trial that was used to suggest that these procedures were safe. There are a lot of risks that these women took.

It's true; most of the different techniques that have been -- that have been studied in the U.S. have happened via private companies. What that does is ensure that there's no opportunity for public oversight. All we have to do is simply fund that research in order to have public oversight. With public oversight, you ensure safety and efficacy. You ensure the ethical process of science, and you ensure the ethical use of this technology.

Is there some way that we can trust society to have reasonable limitations on the advancement of technology? We've offered one. Mitochondrial DNA has 2 percent of your DNA, but it codes only for about .1 percent of what happens in an offspring. It's the essential energy source. What if we stopped it there? What if we decided that that one step is something we believe is safe and efficacious? It would still call for not an outright ban. The next step would be nuclear DNA. And if we felt like nuclear DNA is off limits today until we have better safety studies, that would be a reasonable approach forward, and then we would say, what scientific evidence do we have? Given the scientific evidence that we have, what ethical constraints do we as a society wish to put into place? We do it all the time with every technology we have. We don't ban technologies. We have public transparent debates about the best place to draw the line.

It turned out completely unpredictable because it has really strange fertility disorders. It has a very weird metabolism. And above all, it's much more aggressive than other mice.

The woman's egg has abnormalities in the cytoplasm. And the mitochondria is in the cytoplasm. But her DNA is perfectly normal. So there's several ways that they deal with it. They either take her DNA out of her egg and put it into another egg where the DNA has been removed so she'd operating with her DNA in somebody else's mitochondria. So you have then a child born with the DNA of two women and then one man. And these interactions between the nucleus DNA and the cytoplasm DNA are totally unknown.

There's a technology for mitochondrial transfer that's going to clinical trials from a company in Boston this year. And in that technology, what they've discovered is that women have precursor cells before their egg cells. And those precursor cells can be used to develop their own mitochondria, healthy mitochondria. And they can take their own healthy mitochondria, fuse it with their own nuclear DNA, and they can end up with a healthy offspring, free from mitochondrial disease. Already in clinical trials, already ready to enroll human subjects, already with the green light to go ahead. You would be banning that technology and preventing women who have abnormal mitochondrial DNA from being able to have the choice to have their own genetic children.

They, you know, do prenatal yoga and every other type of thing to try to, you know, make things better.

My name is Gerry Ohrstrom, and my question is for Professor Krimsky. Professor, your debating opponent Lee Silver mentioned that "Mother Nature doesn't care. " In contrast, if I infer correctly, when you briefly introduce the concept of balance in your remarks, you seem to be saying that the genome has evolved as some idealized natural balance and shouldn't be messed with. My question is whether this concept of balance is actually valid, given that evolution operates through randomness and through natural selection in ever-changing random contexts.

And it's remarkable how many children are born normally with the billions and billions of biochemical actions that take place from the fertilized egg until the child is born. So a lot of mistakes were bred out of the system, and it's taken millions of years before the human genome has evolved. Now we're saying, okay, we can get a few technologists to tinker with that and do a better job at the balancing the homeostasis of what I consider an ecosystem, a genetic ecosystem. And my colleague here has pointed out how many abnormalities occur when these genetic mice are manipulated.

This question is really for both sides of the motion. There has been so much in vitro fertilization that's gone on, and I know that there are many studies now that are linking a possible link autism to in vitro fertilization. And is that an example of seeing something after the fact -- a good thing, in vitro has produced many, many babies but now they're thinking that the big, huge spike in autism could have some link to that.

There are particular issues which do change gene function; we know, for example, that embryo freezing on rare occasions changes gene function. We published that from my own laboratory, demonstrating that a cancer suppressing gene is suppressed in its action after routine freezing. We also know from animal studies in mice and rats, that there may be an increased risk of demyelination; that is, a form of ME in the brain in some animals that have had a cell removed. Now, I have to say that these things have to be much more carefully validated. The problem really is, with in vitro fertilization, it's probably rather like meddling with a genome: most of the time, it might well be quite safe. And I would not want people to go away from here thinking that IVF is a horrible thing to do for a child, it clearly isn't. But the full consequences of in vitro fertilization cannot be known for a very long time ahead. It's well worth putting your --

And why is that? Because we have to act in the face of uncertainty in life. I agree, there has not been a strong showing of any link between autism, maybe it has something with age of mothers who are undergoing IVF, we don't know. But I think the much more important question to ask is, we've been using technologies that have some uncertain risks, are the lives worth living that have resulted from those technologies? And the answer is yes, those are lives worth living. The children believe those are lives worth living, the parents believe that those were lives that were worth bringing into life. That's what these technologies have enabled people to do, is to bring into life a life worth living. There may be some risks, there may be some uncertainties, but that doesn't mean it's not worth proceeding.

It has lots of risks, and its risks are not only to the individuals who are involved in it. Its risks are to the society as a whole or to other societies, a new Hitlerian society that arises. The last thing you want to do is to provide a technology that could be misused by authoritarian societies for their own functions. And this is a totally novel frontier that we should be extraordinarily cautious about in trying to break through. We have never done this before. Those examples that she gave us are very tentative. They're full of risks. And if we produce the child that was abnormal, then society would have to deal with it.

Does it mean that we show up with handcuffs at the airport, and we arrest the person? Does it mean that we forcibly test everyone? Because what we're arguing for here is not adding in genomes outside of the human genome, into children. We're arguing that the babies would look identical to ones that are already in our population. So how are we going to detect those differences? And what is the society that prohibits it like going to look like? Is it forcible sterilizations? Is it forcible genetic testing? How are we going to detect it? How are we going to enforce it? And is that a kind of society that we want where we intrude that deeply into our private lives?

I don't see why it would be any different in the future, no matter how children come into conception.

First, thanks to Intelligence Squared for this incredible debate. I believe, as many of us here, this is one of the most important issues that our species will face in our future, so it's great that we're having this important conversation. The arguments of both sides seem to rely on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis process. In the case of the affirmative for screening and in the negative for engineering. My question is, does this mean that by both of your arguments, in the future, sex will be a form of recreation, but IVF will be the preferred form of procreation for advantaged people?

If your question is, is there a constitutional right to access technologies, I'd say no. If the question is, is there a natural right that people should have over procreative liberties, over the choices that they make about having children and who they meet with and whether or not they bring a healthy child into the world, I think that that is the most fundamental of rights that a person has. And an outright ban threatens to intrude upon that in so many different ways, not the least of which is the method of enforcement that you would have to use.

We know far too much about the interaction of the environment and so many other things that give rise to our behaviors and our identities. So the idea that genetic engineering will result in a particular type of behavior that employers can then screen for simply belies an earlier conception of genetic determinism that we have rejected, and we should continue to reject.

What we do have now is genetically engineered food. And this started off with the idea that it was going to enhance food production, it was going to enhance food all over the world. There are many countries that have said, as you're saying, that they didn't know what would happen. And they decided to not do it. We've now seen that it is affecting production of non-genetically engineered food.

So we understand how those genes work because we see the empirical evidence. That's what I am suggesting, that we should allow parents to choose for their own children. Why can't they give the genes that have already been present in other children and promote health, why can't they give those to their own children?

And you cannot just go to a company and say, "I'll be part of your clinical trial," unless there's been some approval for that. Otherwise, their drug would not be accepted by the government. But yet we've heard that there were these experiments that were done without any government imprimatur. We have no idea what the safety controls were in those experiments or how far along in the lifecycle of the child that was born that we have to investigate. So I think safety is very important, and any society has to set up the standards of safety before they do any kind of test.

Actually -- There really -- there really is an issue. You're quite right, this technology is expensive, it would cost tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps even -- maybe even $100,000 to start with. But actually caring for a child that's got a serious genetic disorder is far more expensive. And, of course, the expense of that care is not only the expense, the money, but also the tragedy, the distress, the pain, and all the rest of it. So I think we have to be careful and cautious about the financial arguments, and I'm sure that Lee and Nita would agree with me.

And a few days after her child's birth she got a call from her doctor, who told her to go into the bedroom to check on her sleeping baby to see if he was still alive. The baby had been born with MCAD deficiency; he had inherited this mutation from both my friend and the sperm donor who contributed to the conception. And the mutation was in her genome, and it had been in the genome of her family for hundreds of years, at least, and it was silent; nobody knew about this mutation. With a particular dietary plan, my friend's son is now a healthy five-year-old boy, happy ending to that story. And she and her wife decided to have another child with a sperm donor. So they went to the sperm bank and tested the new donor that they were going to use for mutations in the MCAD gene, and they found the donor was free of mutations in the MCAD gene, which the genetic counselor said should ease her mind. But, in fact, that shouldn't have eased her mind, because MCAD is just one of the hundreds of mutations that she actually has in her genome, so even if the sperm donor had not had MCAD mutation, it's just as possible that he had another mutation that was not compatible with her DNA. So that's the important point that I want to make here that is very important for all of us to remember: there's no perfect baby, there's no perfect person, there's no perfect genome, there's no one human genome. We are all just a combination of many different genetic variants that makes us different from each other for better and for worse.

But prenatal genetic engineering is not enrichment of a newborn, it is an effort to redesign the human genome. Science has succeeded in applying genetic modification for enhancement to animals and crops, some would say successfully, others would say the jury is still out. But in the hundreds and thousands of trials that failed. We simply discard the results of the unwanted crop or animal. Is this the model that civilized humane society wishes to apply to humans? Make pinpoint genetic alterations in the human germ plasm and discard the results when they don't work out. It is sheer hubris to think that manipulating the human germ plasm for enhancement will not produce mistakes. Under our current laws and civil morality, society must bear the expense to care for my severely disabled individual produce the reproductive genetic engineering. I'll leave you with one story. A little over ten years ago, scientists discovered that by modifying a mouse's gene, it greatly improved the mouse's memory. Subsequently, they also learned that modification produced a mouse that increased sensitivity to pain. I want to say a word about the mitochondrial disease problem. Some decisions appear ethical from a pinpoint perspective, but they're clearly unethical from a wider lens. For this, we have to look at the wider lens of genetic engineering and not at the pinpoint perspective in order to understand its ethics to society. Thank you.

In 2001, I attended the wedding of a dear friend. Two years later, she developed thyroid cancer, and she underwent radioactive iodine treatment. The next year, when she and her husband started to try to have children, she learned that she had substantial mitochondrial abnormalities that she would pass on to each and every one of her children. She underwent mitochondrial transfer and now has a beautiful and healthy son, made possible by this technology. We don't know if the radioactive iodine caused those abnormalities. What we do know is that she now has a child -- healthy, active and bright -- from a technology that is available, and we have already used. In 2010, I also received radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. When I'm ready to have children, I hope that I also have the option of having a healthy child with whatever the best technology is that we have available to us today. I'm not here to defend every type of genetic engineering. And I don't think we're ready as a society to embrace it all. But we already know that there are certain forms of genetic engineering that are safe and effective to use. And what I urge you to do is vote against the resolution, to vote in favor of scientific progress, to vote to enable each of us as private citizens to make private choices and the most intimate choice we will ever make in life, to bring healthy children into this world. Thank you.

That is really not at issue here. There's a big issue for the whole of our society and for people in general. I regret to say that I'm saddened to see the simplistic argument about mitochondrial DNA from the other side. We don't understand the interactions with the mitochondria. And already we've seen a number of horrid mishaps. So, of course, maybe a particular individual was lucky, but they might have been unlucky. How different we would have been then. We heard that people have a right to have a healthy child. Of course, they don't have a right, sadly, to have a healthy child. What we do have a right to, though, in a democratic society, surely, is to have access to the best and the safest treatment. And at the moment, the safest treatment is certainly not meddling with the genome. It is not meddling with the mitochondrial DNA. It is actually to look at every other way of dealing with these terrible diseases. We're not ready for it. Of course, at the moment, I have no doubt it shall be banned. Bans can always be lifted if there's more research done to show that it is worth doing. And it's worth bearing in mind too that we're not going to eradicate genetic defects by doing this, not remotely. New defects occur all the time as Lee Silver rightly points out. All of us have defective DNA. 30 percent of boys born with the male form of muscular dystrophy have this as a new mutation, as he well knows. No amount of pre- implantation diagnosis will have changed that. It is a particular problem. And that is always going to be the issue here. The question is how we deal with these diseases actually when we have them. And finally, can I just say, on a very personal note, it really is -- and I don't mean this patronizingly. It's wonderful to see young people in the audience, and it's great to see you here. Thank you very much for sitting so patiently during these arguments. What I think is important to understand is that this technology is something that you will have to deal with in time. And I --

And that concludes our closing statements. And now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. We're going to ask you again now to go to the key pads at your seat that will register your vote. And we will get this readout almost instantaneously. Remember, the motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies. If you agree with the motion, if that means if you agree with the prohibition of it, push number one.

And if you remain or became undecided, push number three. And, as I said before, you can ignore the other keys, and you can correct an incorrectly keyed vote just by pressing the right one, and it'll register your last vote. And we're going to have the results probably in about 120 seconds from now. So I want to say that this has been a spectacularly -- spectacularly well-argued debate by both sides. I just want to invite a round of applause for them for what they did. And there are a lot of debates where I actually reject a lot of questions. There wasn't one bad one tonight at all. I just want to thank everybody in the audience for great questions that you brought up. We would love to have you Tweet about the debate. As I said before, use the Twitter handle @IQ2US. Our hashtag for this debate was #designerbabies. Our next one comes up on Wednesday, March 13th. The motion will be "America doesnt need a strong dollar policy. " Our debaters arguing this motion, Steve Forbes. He is the chairman and editor in chief of Forbes Media. His partner will be James Grant, editor and founder of the Financial Markets Journal, Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Tickets for our -- that season are available through our website, www.IQ2U.S..org. Their opponents, by the way, are -- one card out of my hand -- Frederick Mishkin. He is a former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. And his partner arguing for the motion will be John Taylor who is the chairman and founder of FedEx -- FX Concepts, one of the largest currency hedge funds, not FedEx. For those of you who can't join the live audience, of course there are a lot of other ways to watch this debate. Those of you watching live stream on fora.tv know about that, but you can also listen to these debates on NPR or watch them on PBS stations across the country. Check your local listings for air times and dates. Just a very few -- very small biographical facts about our panelists tonight, though, I didn't get to share. I was able to tell you about the two guys on the end living in the same apartment building. I did not share Robert Winston is actually -- he's been made a peer for his work in the U.K. He actually is known as Lord Winston. And it was at his insistence that we dropped that tonight, because he was over here in the colonies. But actually we had a conference call with him last week. He was in the House of Lords. And he said, "I've got to run. I'll call you back in ten minutes. I've got to go vote. " So that was -- that was a lot of fun. And Nita Farahany, she doesn't want me to say this, but when she graduated from high school, she was the National Forensic Society's single best national debater in the country. And she more or less begged me not to tell you that, so we have the queen of debaters and the lord of -- All right. We now have the final results in. Remember, you voted twice: before the debate and again after hearing the arguments. The team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner. The motion is, "Prohibit genetically engineered babies. " Let's look at the results. For the team that was arguing for this motion to prohibit, before the debate, 24 percent agreed, 30 percent were against, and 46 percent were divided. That was the preliminary vote for everybody. Those are the first results. Now let's look at the vote that the team arguing for the motion received in the second vote. The team arguing for the motion, the second vote is 41 percent. That's an increase of 17 percent. That is the number that the other team needs to beat. It needs to beat 17 percent. Let's see how the other team did. Before, they were 30 percent. They went up to 49 percent. That's a 19 percent difference. They just pushed by. The team arguing against prohibition of genetically engineered babies carries this debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

He is chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. -- Bob Rosenkranz. So what Bob normally does is he takes a minute or two to talk about how we got to choosing this topic and where we think the chips fall in the argument. So let's talk, Bob, with the side that's arguing for the motion, and this motion is -- and against. It's a double negative. They are -- the U.S. does not need a strong dollar policy. And is that basically the same as saying no policy is needed, or does it mean they're asking for a weak U.S. dollar?
America doesnt need a strong dollar policy|i2Debates/031313 strong dollar.p|2|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|1|10|6|0|0|17|0|18|0|0|3|0|33|12|0|3|4|0|0|2|0|95|2|0|0|0|0|0|13|0|0|3|13|0|2|4|2|0|0|0|0|0|5|5|10|21|21|2|12|0|0|0|0|0|6|7|0|5|3|3|24|1|2|0|8|154|Well, I think what they're saying is that the price of the dollar is a price like any other. It's determined by supply and demand. The dollar is strong right now against the yen and against the pound. It's weak against the euro. And this is just normal economic forces operating. They're probably going to say that at times like this, with the U.S. economy weak, a weaker dollar is actually helpful, because it makes imports more expensive, makes exports cheaper, and therefore encourages domestic growth and domestic employment. And so they would argue that we should just let the dollar go where it goes, and I think there's a point here, which is that the government can control interest rates or they can control the price of the currency, but they cannot do both. So a strong dollar policy is essentially an open mouth policy, and it's an open mouth with no teeth.

And on the other side of the argument, the team that's arguing for a strong dollar, what do you expect to hear from them?

When we were on these enormous fiscal deficits for the government and trade deficits, in order for them to be sustainable, foreign central banks have to be willing to hold the overwhelming majority of their reserves in the form of U.S dollars. And if we pursue a policy that's indifferent to the value of the dollar or, worse, deliberately tries to trash the dollar, they're going to lose confidence. The result will be rising interest rates in the United States, an economic slowdown, and disaster for the U.S. government, which has so much debt outstanding.

So why bring this to the stage tonight?

It's a joint venture of their law and business schools. And we collectively felt that this was very timely. You can't pick up a newspaper without seeing some kind of discussion about the, quote, artificial strength of the U.S. dollar versus that of our biggest trading partner, China's renminbi. So there's a lot of talk about trashing the dollar relative to China's currency. And then the efficacy of the federal government or the Fed's policy on printing money, quantitative easing, is, again, a very hot policy debate right at the moment. It's clearly fueled a stock market rally. It's fueled a turnaround in the housing market, all of which are good things. But clearly whether in the long run it's going to result in a decline in the value of the dollar, and does that really matter?

And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for doing all of this. George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses Grant, Abraham Lincoln: four strong leaders, three of them generals, all of them presidents, and all of them get to have their faces on our money, because we like our leaders strong. But what about the greenbacks that those faces decorate? Do we want those dollars to be strong too? Of course we do, we normally say. A muscular dollar is a good thing.

Well, get ready to get current on currency. Yes or no to this statement: America doesn't need a strong dollar policy, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this policy: American doesn't need a strong dollar policy. Our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. Let's meet our debaters. On the side arguing for the motion that America does not need a strong dollar policy, Frederic Mishkin, a professor at Columbia Business School and the former governor of the Federal Reserve. His partner is John Taylor. He is chairman and founder of FX Concepts. Arguing against them, saying that America does need a strong dollar policy, Steve Forbes. He is chairman and editor of Forbes Media. And his partner is James Grant, editor and founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. And I'm going to introduce them again. What we just did is going to be used for a television broadcast, and now I'm going to introduce them again, and this will actually be used for our radio broadcast, so your continued enthusiasm and utterly spontaneous applause is working perfectly well. Our motion is America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. Let's meet the team arguing for the motion. First, let's welcome Frederic Mishkin. And, Frederic, and we're going to call you "Rick" is your -- is how you like to go, okay. You're a professor at Columbia Business School. You were a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. You used to go around the country giving a talk on the issue of whether a certain amount of inflation falls into a comfort zone. The title of your talk was "Comfort Zones, Schmomfort Zones. " Now, this word, " Schmomfort," this is a technical economic term that you --

" As always, we ask you, our live audience, to act as our judges. By the time the debate has ended, we will have asked you to vote twice, both once before the debate and again after you've heard the arguments and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. So let's have you go to our preliminary vote. Let's register your preliminary vote. If you go to those keypads at your seat, our motion is "America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. " If you agree with the motion, if you think America does not need a strong dollar policy, you push number one. If you disagree with the motion, you push number two. That means that you fell America does need a strong dollar policy. And if you're undecided, which in our forum is a perfectly reasonable starting position, push number three. You can ignore all of the other keys. They're not live. And if you push the key incorrectly, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. And what happens at the end of the debate, soon as the debate is -- the third round is over, you vote again, and then about one minute later, thanks to the miracle of computing, we instantly are able to declare a winner.

Our motion is "America does not need a strong dollar policy. " And here to argue first for the motion, Frederic Rick Mishkin, professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia Business School and a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.
America doesnt need a strong dollar policy|i2Debates/031313 strong dollar.p|24|R2|FREDERIC MISHKIN|for|4|84|11|0|0|71|0|115|0|0|12|5|158|47|0|28|19|0|0|3|0|610|25|0|0|0|0|31|62|0|1|7|67|1|0|21|13|2|2|10|18|0|7|92|118|97|163|13|148|0|0|0|0|1|73|95|0|10|5|24|158|48|16|4|46|915|So just to start, I have to tell you I went to Oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, I was a New Yorker, she said, "How come you still talk like a New Yorker? " So it didn't work. But I never actually went to Oxford Union debates. And this is actually styled after it. I wish I had. So what I'd like to do first is just to talk about the way that we're going to branch out in terms of my teammate and I. I'm going to focus first on the domestic economy. And actually because of what I do for a living, both in terms of the research I've done and the fact that I was a policy maker at the Federal Reserve, and my teammate John Taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong dollar policy. So let me actually go out and make two points. And the first point is that when we think about what is good policy, I'm going to say what is a good policy for the American economy. And in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now? And two things that I want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle, where are we in terms of unemployment? Not very good. We have unemployment rate of 7.7 percent. People are out there struggling. And furthermore, we're in a situation where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level. So in fact we're in a situation where we're not doing as well as we'd like on either component of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy. Furthermore, the economy is not growing that fast. It's been growing very, very slowly, hasn't really picked up yet. So we're in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which is on the low side. So now let's ask what would a strong dollar do? Well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that would make American goods and services more expensive; if they're more expensive people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services the way they did before. What will that do? That will actually end up lowering the demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken further. Is that what we want? Absolutely not right now, because we'd actually get an economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower, which has been trending down, it'll go actually down lower. So it's not the right policy at this particular point in time. And so, in that sense, I think that it's a very bad policy to think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar. So that's point one. Point two is a little bit more subtle and I'm going to be a little more academic here, that I'm actually going to argue that it's a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong one or a weak one. Why? Because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal policy, to actually stabilize the economy. At the current juncture we're in a situation where inflation is on the low side, we're actually in a situation where unemployment is on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don't want to have a strong dollar. In fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong -- having tight policy would be the right thing to do. In particular, we raise interest rates rather than keep them low. And that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation. And we've been in periods where, in fact, we've had high inflation, very worried about it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy. That would also result in a stronger dollar, then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction. A stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to go to policies that result in a strong dollar. The point here is that in a situation where you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that's not the ultimate objective for policy makers. The ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have a very strong economy. So I'm going to end a little early, I'm told I get a little points for ending a little early. But I made those two points and clearly there'll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard, which would be fun. I have bad news for you, Steve, your wish is not going to be fulfilled. I'm not a big fan of the gold standard. I'm sure we'll discuss that later. But with that, why don't I leave it to the other side?

The dollar is a unit of measurement. It measures the price of everything and anything. It preserves us from barter. It stores the value of work. The sine qua non of any unit of measurement is that it be fixed exacting, unwavering, true. My teammate and I, Steve Forbes favor a stable dollar so we oppose the motion in the same spirit we support the 12 inch foot, the well calibrated bathroom scale, and the more than 16 ounce serving of Mountain Dew. Now among the enumerated powers of congress is that to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin, and fix the standard weights and measures. The constitutional dollar was no placing of our monetary mandarins; it was a standard like the mile. Through most of the nations history, a dollar was defined under law as a particular weight of gold and silver, more often of gold, specifically of 23.22 grains fine. A little more than $20 was convertible on request into an ounce of gold, by and by the dollar was redefined. In the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of gold but still, still it was defined, anchored as something. Then came the fateful evening of August 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popular horse opera, Bonanza, President Nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar would have no definition, no anchor. No longer would Americas creditors have the option of converting 35 George Washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetary medium that nobody can print. Henceforth said Nixon, lashing out against unnamed speculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper. And that at least, is one political promise that Washington D.C. has faithfully kept. And what has this soft, undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought? Well in 1971, the gross public debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of GDP. As of yesterday, the gross public debt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 GDP. Now think of the long-grade line of plans and resolutions to bring our national finances under control. The institution of the Congressional Budget Office. Gramm-Rudman- Hollings, the emergency deficit control act, Reaffirmation Act of 1987, and on and on, and now comes Paul Ryan. Will he be our messiah? Well maybe, but I doubt it. As long as the treasury can borrow at 2 percent and as long as the Federal Reserve can conjure hundreds of billions of what they are pleased to call dollars, with which to buy up these emissions of debt, the red ink will continue to spill. Alexander Hamilton himself might have succumbed to the temptation. Anyway, in 1971, the final year in which the dollar was anchored by something, anything, foreign governments held U.S. government securities on the order of $31 billion. $31 billion. These holdings today top $3.3 trillion. They are the spore of our non-stock deficit on dirt goods and services. Consuming more than we produce, Americans remit dollars by the boatloads to our Asian creditors who obligingly return them by return mail in the shape of American investments in American IOUs. Its as if the dollars never left the 50 states. Sweet it has been this privilege of America, the privilege of paying its foreign creditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print. But the unprivileged are fighting back. They too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra- low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing. You know, some years ago, the Financial Times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing, that is to say in laymens language, central banks conjuring of new paper money secured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it. I finally think I understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote. What I no longer understand is the meaning of the word money. Under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance their budgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square up accounts. I dont have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today. Deficits grow and imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetary sense. After all, we are playing tennis without a net. And for that matter, without baselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls. Incongruous this is as well, volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated, the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime of weights and measures. And a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projects involve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes to an accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as Robert Crease relates in his book, "World in the Balance. " Well, well, it's an ill wind that blows no one any good. Unanchored exchange rates have created a cottage industry and monetary volatility. John Taylor. John Taylor, from whom you'll hear in a moment has built a thriving foreign exchange trading business on the ashes of the good as gold dollar. Well, just look at the quality of that man's suit. It's a fabulous business. The more the currencies dance and swerve, the better it is for Mr. Taylor and his hedge fund. To him, as to others in the forex trades, the very idea of monetary stability is -- it's worse than anathema. It's unprofitable. I would no more expect him to espouse a system of stable currencies and fixed exchange rates than I would an oncologist to welcome a cure for cancer. No, that is -- that's not my best one. Our post-1971 helter-skelter monetary system also favors the prodigious talents of John's sparring partner and my sparring partner, his partner, Rick Mishkin. The holder of a Ph.D. in economics from MIT, a prolific author, and coach at , Fred ought to be at NASA. He should, if for not his sake, for our sake. And so should every holder of a Ph.D. in the Federal Reserve Board. Ladies and gentlemen, we've alighted from the gold standard over a course of decades into something that we should all regret, the Ph.D. standard.

Our motion is -- well, a reminder of where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligent Squared U.S. Debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two against two, fighting it out over this motion, "America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. " You've heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. Debating in support of the motion that "America does not need a strong dollar policy," the chairman and founder of the investment management company FX Concepts, and a former vice president at Citibank where he headed research for foreign exchange. Ladies and gentlemen, John Taylor.

I would start out by saying that, Jim, your first statement to Rick was that you would be cutting the number of employees at the Fed. I would say that if we follow any of your policies, we'd be cutting the number of employees everywhere. And, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every currency in the world is as good as paper. We're not worse. We're not better. But the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar that's as good as paper is convertible into anything. You don't have to hold those dollars. I give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where I tell people -- I hold up a Zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that's worth about 20 cents and tell people that "You shouldn't just keep your money in the United States, you should put your money around the world. You should be free. " But the fact of the matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the United States. Why can the Treasury borrow at 2 percent? They're not forcing you to lend them at 2 percent. They're not forcing the Bank of England to invest its money at 2 percent. They're not enforcing the Chinese to invest their money at 2 percent. But they do. And, therefore, the dollar has a value. Paper or not, it's got a value. And gold is not necessary. Also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of course, your currency is Zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that. By the way, the latest figure I saw was that the National Bank of Zimbabwe had $210 in its account. That's the central bank. I don't know. The value's probably changed in the last week or two. But because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and that means Brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we're no longer on this standard where the U.S. has a -- you know, there's power over the world, we borrow in our own currency, and everybody else is stuck. They have to, you know, balance their budget, do all the right things. No, unfortunately, in a way, from Jim's point of view, and I'm sure Steve's, as we'll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much. I don't think it's a good idea, I don't think it's necessarily going to end well. I believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the United States, as my partner Rick has pointed out. It would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a very strong impact on the rest of the world. If you're looking at the easy side of this from the U.S.'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have? Well, for a start it has a lot of impact on jobs in Ohio, in Michigan, in places where we actually produce things in the United States, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are to have a manufacturing sector. In 1985, when the U.S. had a strong dollar policy, and after a while a stated strong dollar policy under Ronald Reagan and Volcker, we began to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, "the rust belt. " And the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn't produce anything that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong. So now we all drive Mercedes and Toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that come out of Michigan. Now, let's face it, Michigan has other problems, and if you were -- I know I'm going to get defeated on this, Toyotas are all made in the United States, Hondas are made in the United States, yeah, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama. There are reasons for that. But the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar -- the weak dollar today has brought these European and Japanese companies into the United States, even Korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too. One of the things that the Japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the Toyota plants come back to Japan so that they can actually employ Japanese to make Toyotas instead of people from Kentucky or Tennessee. So the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren't a hell of a lot of jobs. How does the world do with the dollar? A strong dollar is bad for the world as well. And it's kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if youve got a strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us. Right? Because everything looks cheap to us, right? And I must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look cheap to us. Now a lot of things look quite expensive. In fact, one of the worst things about a weak dollar is the fact that we can't go to Europe on vacation; it's too damn expensive. If we had a strong dollar, Europe would be cheap and we could all go on vacation, but at the same time, all the New York City hotels would be empty, whereas now you walk around the New York City hotels, well, they're just loaded with people from places that I never thought could possibly afford New York. And it's always interesting for me to sit and talk with somebody and have him tell me how much more expensive Belgrade is than New York. That's like, "What? You got to be kidding. But they were serious But overseas, it's a little difficult to understand, but if the dollar is declining, then it's very inexpensive to build a plant, to finance your trade, because a weak dollar, which is the global currency because the dollar has been out there for years -- a weak dollar is the thing that you finance your trade in. And if you know the dollar is going to be weaker in a year or two or three, you don't repay it. You might be paying 6 percent for your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you're paying minus 4. So it's a gift. So when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from Citibank, from JP Morgan, from Goldman Sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system does very well. When the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, "Oh, my god, I now owe more for this loan, and my plant that I built in Thailand isn't as successful as I thought, and so I have to close it down and I have to lay off workers. " So when the dollar gets strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the United States is in a bit of a problem. Can we have a strong dollar policy? We argue strongly that we can't, because there is no place for us to do it. We have to support the world.

Thank you. Thank you all very much for coming here tonight. I want to emphasize with Jim that we believe in a strong and stable dollar. We don't like inflation; we don't like deflation. We like "flation. " Stability. This -- so let's lead. What is money? Money makes it easier to buy and sell with one another, to do transactions with each other. It is through buying and selling that wealth is ultimately created, doing things, interacting with each other. Before we had money, in the old days we had barter. If I sold an ad in Forbes Magazine 3,000 years ago, how would I get paid? Perhaps with a herd of goats. Let's say I wanted to buy iPads for our writers, so I go to the iPad store 3,000 years ago with my goats. Store owner says he doesn't want goats; he wants sheep. So then I have to figure out how I swap my goats for sheep. Perhaps I have to hire a sheep herder so the wolves don't eat the sheep. Sheep herder wants to be paid in wine. I've got red wine; he wants white wine. So it becomes very, very cumbersome. Money makes all this easier, more convenient to do those transactions. So we got coins in Lydia 2,600 years ago. Then Athens picked it up, became a great commercial and cultural center. Got coins, and then paper, and then blips on a computer, but all of it means it makes it easier to do commerce, makes it easier to buy and sell with one another. That's the function of money. If we had barter today, imagine what it would be like, trying to deposit a cow into an ATM or take out a pig from an ATM. So we have money, and money is like anything, fixed weight and measure. If it has a fixed value, it becomes extremely useful. We have -- when you go to the supermarket, say, buy a pound of hamburger, you assume it has 16 ounces, not 18, not 12. We don't float that pound from the British pound. But you know when you go to the market, 16 ounces. Twelve inches in a foot, that doesn't float. Imagine building a house 3,000 square feet if the rule floats each day. Take -- what would your life be like if the Federal Reserve did to the clock what it does to the dollar? Float the clock. So it's 60 minutes in an hour one day, 20 minutes the next, 22 the next, 90 the next. You'd soon need to have hedges, derivatives futures, to figure out how many hours you're working. So let's say you hire somebody, 15 bucks an hour, do you pay that -- is that a New York hour? New Jersey hour? Bangladesh hour? Let's say you're baking a cake. It says bake the batter 45 minutes. You have to figure out, is that an inflation-adjusted minute? So a weak dollar, unstable dollar, makes commerce harder, and it has very destructive impacts. First of all, it misdirects investment. Without investment, we don't get a higher standard of living. A weak dollar is like a virus in a computer, corrupts the information. When the dollar becomes weak, what happens to the flow of investment money? It becomes defensive. It goes into commodities. Try to preserve what you have instead of invest to grow in the future. You saw it in the 1970s. $3 oil went to $40 a barrel. When Reagan and Volcker stabilized the dollar in the '80s, crashed down to $10, stabilized to $20. From the mid-1980s to the early part of this last decade when the Fed went off the rails again, dollar average -- average price of a barrel of oil more than $21. And now look what it is today, $80, $90. You saw it with the housing. We had an artificial housing boom in the late '70s, even worse one this time. The housing bubble could not have happened without a weak dollar. So you get financial bubbles. Another thing that happens is, when you have a week currency, real wages go down, which is why the median income in the country's gone nowhere for 10 years. Your salaries go down in real terms, which is why after 40 years of this nonsense, of having floating dollars like a floating clock, it takes two incomes in the family to do what one income could do several generations ago. So when the dollar goes down in value, you pay more for food; you pay more for gas; you pay more for electricity, which means money -- less money for other things. And so U.S. median incomes, as I mentioned, went down. And so workers do better when you have, in terms of improving their standard of living, people do better when they're in countries where the currency is stable, and they do worse in currency -- in countries over time that have weak currencies. It also harms our security. Weak money, as I mentioned, has an artificial boost to commodity prices, particularly oil. That means vast transfers of wealth to commodity producers and the like, and also vast transfers lending trillions of dollars to countries unfriendly to the U.S. like Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. Weak dollar also has a moral dimension. It undermines social trust. It severs, or certainly weakens, the link between effort and reward. Wealth and progress is achieved less by hard work like gaining new skills, perhaps starting a new business, and more by speculation and gambling. Weak dollar means windfall gains, as I mentioned, for commodities and for exotic financial instruments and hurts small businesses and many start-ups. Faith in the future is undermined because it then suddenly becomes the present. Hard work is made a mockery of. You worry about whether you and your children, your grandchildren, are going to have a higher standard of living. The economy seems more like a casino rather than something where hard work can get you a better life. John Maynard Keynes summed it up very well. Keynes said, "Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than a debauched currency. " That is, weaken the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner in which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. What this means is, what we see happening today, this feeling that something is not right, this feeling that speculation, doing exotic financial instruments, greedy oil companies and the like is the way to get ahead instead of hard work -- it all relates to a weak and unstable currency. So just as you want 60 minutes in an hour, just as you want 16 ounces in a pounds, just as you want 5,280 feet in a mile, you need stability, fixed measure of value. That's all the dollar is, makes it easier to do commerce when it's stable in value. You do more commerce, pure productive commerce. So bottom line is, wages suffer, investment gets skewed, we don't have a higher standing living that we would have had, and it weakens social trust. Stable dollar is what we need, not funny money from politicians who think they know how to do our lives better than we do. Thank you.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. And now on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience. Here's where we stand at the beginning of round two. Our motion is, America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. Arguing in support of that motion, in other words arguing against a strong dollar policy, we have Fred Mishkin and John Taylor. They have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts. It hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity. And the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy. The team arguing against, and that means they're arguing for a strong dollar, James Grant and Steve Forbes, are arguing, yes, we do need a strong dollar, that a strong dollar is one that is fixed, that money was invented to represent and hold value so that business could be done. When that doesnt happen, when your 12 inch ruler doesn't have 12 inches anymore, the meaning of money begins to slip out of sight. They said specifically, workers do better when the economy is stable, and workers -- the workers do better when the currency is stable, and worse when it's not. I want to put that question to their opponents. To Ric Mishkin.

What can I tell you. But I, first I want to talk about, I think that theres a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run -- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy. And in that context, youre absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing. Im in no way advocating that. And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesnt fly. So let me give you reasons why. If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth lets say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period. The problem is that youre now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars. And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasnt a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now. Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God. So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880 -- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldnt find any gold. Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground. So theres really an issue of technology here. The question is, can you actually get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan Greenspan I think said rightly so, is its like pornography, you know it when you see it. Its when you dont worry about whats happening to the price level in your day to day decisions. We completely agree that thats the right way to run the economy.

Im older than you and I remember it very well. And your critique of the gold standard, if I may say, I think, reveals some of the weaknesses of the Federal Reserves approach to our monetary affairs of the present day. The Fed has its knives out for the thing they are pleased to call deflation. You, ladies and gentleman, might know this as every day low and lower prices. Most Americans spend most of the weekend looking for the thing the Fed deplores. The Fed means to create this amount of credit such that prices do not dwindle, fall, weaken. Now, what will you expect prices to do in a world of technological wonder in which hundreds of millions of willing new hands are added to the worlds labor force? In which digital technology breaks down the barriers to production the world over. In which marvels of engineering shove each other out of the news every day. We cant keep up with the rate of gain in productivity. What will you expect price to do? Well prices, I would suppose dwindle, the supply curve is shifting downward and to the right. Therefore prices might benignly fall. The Fed will have none of it. The Fed insists on creating that amount of dollars that will deliver unto us that measure of inflation the Fed thinks we need, namely two percent, which by the way, they cant really measure. So what we have is persistent credit bubbles, in the name of what they are pleased to call price stability. Which is not price stability, its --

Weve had a huge fall in the price of memory. You take an iPod today. Memory costs what, $40, $50? Ten years ago, it would have cost $10,000. So as Jim said, with productivity prices might go down, which is good for us. So in terms of the free markets, prices may go up, may go down. You have a drought, they'll go up. Again, the money should be stable in value. The United States, from the time we went on the gold standard in 1789 right through -- some on and offs, through '71, had one of the most extraordinary growth periods in human history. We surpassed our neighbors in Latin America. We surpassed Europe in terms of growth, which is why we attracted more immigrants than any other country in the world where it seems a place of opportunity. And one of the key things that Hamilton and Washington brought in was realizing if you fool around with the money, what that does is hurts commerce. People hold physical assets instead of going out, and doing, and investing in the future. You know, when you invest something, John, you don't know whether -- you know, you might not get a return for three years, five years, seven years down the road. That's risky, but it's even riskier, and you're less likely to do it, if you don't know what you're going to be paid back in. Is it going to be a 100 cent dollar, an 80 cent dollar, a 20 cent dollar? If you don't know, get less of that productive investment and look at --

Absolutely positively, unless the U.S. government was pushing to keep the wage levels of U.S. workers up. And so I believe that, in fact, the movement to a weak dollar had a lot to do with the fact that we had a growth in Asia coming, and product was coming in much cheaper and basically undercutting, well, not only Detroit, but California, and the -- if you look at apples, or whatever, they're -- none of them are made in the United States, right?

It's not American workers. When other foreign companies came over and established car plants, they could turn out excellent cars. Our workers made excellent wages. It wasn't because cars were cheap, people felt they worked better, whether the low end of the car line or the high end. That's good competition.

Does it hurt it? Does having a good dollar yardstick help the economy? Does it hurt it? I think that's very important, but not -- let's not get into this view that having a strong dollar, or gold standard, or weak dollar actually solves all of our problems.

I don't agree with that at all. I think that's really our point, is that you have be flexible; the dollar has period where it needs to be strong. I -- Paul Volcker is one of my heroes. He did everything right when he came in. And I was there for the Saturday night massacre and I did not have a good time, but it was the right thing to do when he all of a sudden changed the way that the fed manage money and interest rates shot up by 4 percent over the weekend. That was a very, very good shock for the U.S. government, and it was a brilliant stroke. It had nothing to do with the price of gold, it changed it a great deal, but it really was a decision made by the fed and, obviously, with the agreement of the Treasury.

I think it is worth noting that the inflation of house prices, which went unremarked by our financial scholars at the Federal Reserve. The inflation in house prices almost brought this country, financially speaking, down. Now, the CPI or the, whatever the Feds preferred measure of inflation, was fine. Unbeknownst to the Fed and hundreds of monetary scholars on the payroll, some of them whom Id keep by the way, just for the sake of equity. Unbeknownst to these experts, there was building up in the economy, something that models didnt even look at, which is a huge build up of unsupportable debt, mortgage debt in the banking system and outside the banking system. Now inflation is not a certain threshold reading on a CPI inflation, its too much money. Chasing something well know about after the bubble burst. Now it could be inflation of the checkout counter, that was 1970, but you must keep up, right John? Must keep up with the modern times and inflation can be an inflation of bond prices, of equities, of LBO debt, of Greenwich real estate. Because by the way, the rich get richer in a regime of low interest rates, and they get richer big. They get richer big because they borrow for nothing. So inflation is a much subtler term than the Fed knows or acknowledges to this day. And they cant control it. Its like a bubble underwater. They squeeze part of it and another part of the bubble protrudes.

And weve just gone through a terrible period this way. But in fact this has been happening through history and in fact has been happening frequently when weve had gold standards and also when we didnt. During the gold standard era, we actually had these bubbles all the times in the U.S. We had financial crises about every 10 to 20 years, so youre right that this is something that we have to worry about. But catching the -- basically the strong dollar policy that you advocate is not going to produce the outcome you want. We actually need policies to think about moderating credit cycles. Thats something we have to worry about. I think we agreed on that. But in fact tying to gold, maybe you see it, but I sure as hell dont/

We briefly did during the War of 1812, played around with silver, which led to the panic of 1819. We had banks that werent regulated in the 1830s, theyd issued a lot of currency so we got a panic in 1837. And on and on you go. So it doesnt prevent people from doing crazy things. But what a gold standard will do--and why gold? What it means is you have a fixed measure value, like a north star. Better than any other thing in the world, gold keeps its intrinsic value. It may go up a little bit, down a little bit, but its the best thing we humans have on earth for stability. So all it is is a measuring rod, making sure, the market should determine, not mandarins at the Fed, how much money is needed in the marketplace. And under a gold standard, if you have a vibrant economy, plenty of money is created. If you have a stagnant economy, moneys not created.

Why? Because inflation's a form of taxation, of taking resources from you without putting a tax on you as John Maynard Keynes pointed out. This is the first time outside of a major war that we've had countries since the 1970s continuously undermining the value of their currencies. Never happened in the developed world in peacetime like that. Wartime, you do everything. You raise taxes, borrow money, print money to win the war. After the war, you go back to stability. This time, we haven't done it.

That's in fact something that we do have to deal with. Indeed, one of the views in terms of research is that actually having a stable period may actually encourage a bubble because people dont think there's enough risk, and in fact there is a lot of risk. So I can't see how we're going to solve the problems here of bubbles by actually being in a situation where we actually tied to some kind of commodity.

What we really want to have is high growth in the economy and stability in the economy, that's what we're really after. And if you have an inflation rate which is too low, then you're actually in a situation where you get deep deflation, something that you think is not a problem, but I can tell you, when you look at history and ask when we've had the worst crises, and the worst recessions, and the worst depressions, they were always associated with deflation. So this is not something that I see as a particular positive. So you actually want to protect against not having too high inflation and not having too low. The second thing that's very important in this regard is that when you have an inflation rate which is too low, you actually get into a situation where sometimes, because of a very negative shock as we've had recently, you would actually like to drive nominal interest rates below zero. You'd like to drive the federal funds rate negative, and you can't do it, and, therefore, you can't stimulate the economy enough. So this is actually a problem that we worry about tremendously in terms of the policy circles. And what it tells you is you want to have a deflation rate which is, one, not so high that you spend a lot of time actually making decisions about where the price level's going to be, but instead produce, which produces a good economy, but secondly not so low that you end up in a situation where you get deflations, where you get this situation where you can't do expansionary policy when you need it, and as a result you have to pick a number in between. Most central banks have chosen around .

We ship these dollars abroad, they come back to us as investments, and we are given the -- as I say, this ever so sweet path to fiscal ruin. We have accumulated more than $3 trillion and the feds own balance sheet custody holdings of U.S. Treasuries that foreign governments and central banks hold against us. So the reserve currency is the invitation to, first the U.K. after 1914, and then us, to consume more than we produce, and it's not the swiftest way to prosperity.

Steve and Jim, right now, were seeing $1 buy about 96 yen and there are complaints from Detroit and other places that the yen is too weak. When the Clinton administration first formulated its strong dollar policy, a dollar bought 104 yen and their rationale was the dollar was too weak.

You dont know today if that 15, 1600 price is factoring in a lot of future inflation. If people dont expect it anymore, the price may come down. So you have a period of adjustment. But the fact of the matter is, what you see happening today is slow motion what happened in the early 1930s when countries thought that the way out was to devalue their currencies, starting with Germany, then Britain in 1931. Thirty countries followed afterwards, begger than neighbor policies, which is why Britain and others agreed to go back on gold in 1944. They saw what happened during the Depression.

In your opening statement, you mentioned that a lot of the mischief that occurred in the economy, a lot of the financial accounting scandals and tricks that people turned, that didnt really produce any value, was attributed to the floating dollar. Could you state why exactly a strong dollar or gold based dollar would actually prevent that type of financial mischief?

When you have a stable currency, even when you have unstable currency, most countries like to fix, or have at least an attachment to another currency to facilitate trade. So youd see what you had under the Bretton Woods system, pretty good stability. When you have a stable dollar, since commodities are denominated in dollars, the violence you see in commodities goes down, so the ability to play games with that goes down. And you also have, you can now then makepositive investments again, no need for exotic instruments to play games with the housing mortgages and the like. And I think you would see a smaller banking sector. One of the things thats happened since weve gone off gold is that finance as a percentage of our GDP at one point had doubled. And it should have gone in the opposite direction. Finance should have gone in the way of agriculture and other parts, where technology takes over and other parts of the economy grow. So, bankers, dont worry, youll have jobs tomorrow.

This is a paper that Anna Schwartz who I think you would consider to be the leading monetary historian of this generation along with Milton Friedman. And in fact, she looked at different periods, and the period of the classical gold standard, when the U.S. was continuing in the gold standard, was not a period of high growth. So the numbers right here is that the U.S. grew at 1.8 percent per year at that time.

This is as paper that Anna wrote Mike Bordo called Monetary Policy Regimes and Economic Performance: the Historical Records. So its very much on this topic. Actually there was a lot of instability, that the standard deviation, how much variability there was, was 4.9. For her data, looking at the period from 1974 to 1995, which is after Bretton Woods went off the gold standard, that we actually had a situation where growth is about the same amount, with much less instability. My argument here is not that I think that the gold standard was good or bad for growth, but that it was not the key aspect.

I don't credit it.

So, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Grant, the -- you've asserted that the goal standard creates stability inherently, but we've seen numerous asset bubbles throughout the gold standard periods including, you know, the South Sea bubble in the United Kingdom, the Dutch Tulip bubble, et cetera, et cetera. What prevents, in your opinion, the gold standard from creating or having more bubbles in that period as well?

The others have existed on blackboards at Cambridge and MIT, but the gold standard existed in practice for 100 years, the classical gold standard did. Now, one must distinguish between the definition of money under the gold standard and the banking systems in play -- in place during that period. Now, as Steve mentioned, human beings will err, and sometimes they'll err en masse, and there will be crashes and bubbles. What to me characterizes the gold standard period is the absence of growth throttling long dated depressions, owing to -- owing to uncertainty about the future value of money. Such depressions as existed in that period were typically the result of uncertainty about monetary fears, such as the one that started in 1893, such as the depression of 1890, when there was a great hew and cry over William Jennings Bryant. But banking bubbles it seems to me were much less severe for the simple reason that bankers at the time were personally accountable in some degree, certainly bank stockholders were personally accountable for the solvency of the institutions in which they invested. There was a double liability .

" So volatility of the business cycle, of employment, volatility of the growth of GDP, which was much higher during the period 1881 to 1913 and which is the period of the classical gold standard, the first great gold standard according to Jim, than it was in later periods. That fact is very clear, I don't know of any serious scholar -- you may have people that you think have other numbers, but I can tell you that when I've seen the research that has been done in this area by people who have tremendous integrity and are incredibly respected, Anna Schwartz being one of those people, they come up with exactly that answer. And also there was actually much more volatility of the inflation rate during that period. That's the facts.

I think that the point is is that is the future, which is what we're living now, more successful than the past, than what the gold standard was? And I can't -- unfortunately this is not -- I'd like to be a great social scientists and say I'm going to run a -- run a test here, but I can't run the test with the gold standard.

That's the implicit argument. Monetary thought does not run in a line of constant improvement, nor does human thought. Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote about a wonderful essay about the reappearance of witchcraft in the high renaissance, and during this period in which enlightenment supposedly prevailed around the earth, the leading lights of western thought were actually captive in this most cruel hoax of witchcraft. I submit to you that posterity looking back on this moment in monetary affairs will look upon the doings of the world central banks that have, as I say, alighted into a kind of a makeshift central planning from what is meant to be a very simple act. A central bank may look upon this as a period of kind of the dark ages of monetary application and thought. This --

Most of the arguments I've heard have been in the context of economic cycles, but I'm worried about the fact that the world could lose confidence in the United States just like it's lost confidence in other -- like a GE that was a AAA company and decided that, you know, going into the lending business was a good idea. Well, it wasn't. So how would you, on the for the motion side, recast your arguments in terms of confidence in the United States and what the United States has to do to keep that confidence.

In fact, when we've had a problem is when we pursued extremely inflationary policies. In fact, this is why we went off Bretton Woods, because we actually had a situation of very bad monetary policy and also bad fiscal policy as a result of fighting the Vietnam War and some serious mistakes that were made.

A weak dollar policy is not something Id advocate either. And the reason is this, is exactly is, is youre focused on how your exports are doing well to competitors. And thats not a great way to do policy. Central banks and policy makers throughout the world should try to stabilize their economies. And in fact, whatever way the value of the currencies go in that context, so be it.

And capital flows that much easier. Which is why in Africa, you have 14 nations that are attached to the Euro, 13 nations that have currency boards where they attach to a currency. So among our trading partners, they find it very disruptive when the dollar goes all over the place and their currencies wobble up and down. So in terms of stability, yes, it would be good for developing countries, because it would facilitate trade and facilitate the trade of capital. You never get ahead in a sustained way, productive way, by fooling around with your money, any more than you would changing, what now, feet in a mile.

We depend on trust. When you go to the restaurant, you trust -- to pay the bill. When you go on an airplane, you trust that these people know what they're doing, and when you do transactions, you trust that you get in return what you've been promised, and you'll give what you promised. And with an unstable currency, what it does is undermine hard work and productive effort and give undue rewards to speculation, undue rewards to commodities. That's why oil has gone from 21 to 90 or $100 a barrel. That's why you saw this speculation mad, speculation in housing instead of productive facilities or finding cures to diseases. So it misdirects investment. We saw that in the '70s, huge investment in farmland and commodities. They crashed in the '80s. Those investments had to be liquidated. A lot of wasted capital. Stability, again, it's just a measure of value.

On to round three, closing statements by each debater in turn. Our motion is, "America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. " And here to argue against the motion, which means he is for a strong dollar policy, James Grant, editor and founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Buzz, buzz, buzz. I'm going to do that again because I needed -- you all missed the applause cue -- -- so badly. So I want to introduce James again and give him that robust welcome that you've been doing all night, thanks. No, no, no, no -- . We're really out of sync now, I'm going to introduce him again, and when I say his name, then that would be the moment, thanks. And here to summarize his position against the motion, James Grant, editor and founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

" And one of these books was the biography of her future husband called "Farmer Boy. " It was about the life of a hardscrabble dairy farmer and his family in upstate New York. This was during the 1880s when, contrary to Anna Schwartz, America was on fire -- -- but from a very low base. People were not wealthy. And one day, the farmer took his son to the fair, summertime, and lemonade was on sale. And the kid screwed up his courage and asked for a nickel to buy a round of lemonade for his friends, and the father astonishingly produced from his jeans a 50 cent piece. The child was speechless, and the father asked him, not wanting to let a moment go by without instruction, asked if he knew what that was, this coin. And the kid, of course, said nothing, how could we say anything? He was literally struck numb. And the father said, "It's money," so he asked the son, "Son, do you know what money is? " Again, silence. And the boy said, "I --" and the father said, "Money is work. " And money is the stored value of work; this is the moral of the question. So you work all day and you earn something for it and that something is called money, and you save some of that because there are only so many heartbeats and a lifetime is precious, you save some of it for later. Now, what our opponents would like you to -- would like you to believe is that through the most dexterous use of advanced mathematics they can calibrate the rate of depreciation in that money so that you will -- won't even notice it. But Steve and I are here to tell you that you will notice it, and we are also here to tell you that the ways of higher mathematics are not the ways towards price stability. What is attempted today is unique and it will not work. Vote against this proposition.

If stability is the goal of government and of government policy, then it must lean against the wind, whichever way that wind is blowing. If the economy is growing too fast, it must act to slow the economy; and if the economy is growing too slowly, it must act to speed it up. That is the policy that the government has been following for at least since World War II. That policy, at least according to Jan Tinbergen, who did win a Nobel Prize in economics, the first one, given in 1953, said that there were four independent variables that drove the government's ability to control the economy and the economic outputs that are important to the people who live there. And so that's why I'm worried about the social welfare of the people. Those policies were money growth, interest rate levels, fiscal policy, i.e., the level of taxing and the level of spending, and the currency value. Currency value was one of the four instruments that was chosen to manage the government output. That was in 19 -- actually, earlier than 1953. The Nobel Prize is never given to somebody who's done the work right then. But was involved with the Bretton Woods situation, and it was even-- by one of the leading economists of the world recognized that even under that time -- that currency movement was critical to keeping the world moving forward. So my argument is that we should have a flexible policy that allows us to lean into the wind, or lean, -against it, depending on which way we need the government to act. And so, therefore, we need that flexibility and we are against a strong dollar policy.

Keynes was right about over time when you weaken a currency you do undermine the social order. Ask yourselves, why is it that two incomes in the family can't seem to do what one income could do 40 years ago? It's been gradual, but it's been acidic, very real. What the federal reserve is doing is the equivalent of what you might call the federal reserve diet. How much raising the number of ounces in a pound from 16 to 20? Your weight goes down 20 percent; if you weigh 200 pounds, suddenly you're 160 pounds; you weigh 150, suddenly you weigh 120. The fed could do the same thing with a mirror that makes you look svelte and thin. This way obesity goes away, this way you can eat more, weigh less, and look thinner. Well, put that way, it is absolutely ridiculous thinking if you change a measure of something that, therefore, you can achieve a desired result. Inflation is the equivalent of changing the number of ounces in a pound or changing how a mirror makes you look, it is distortive, ridiculous, and destructive. Inflation is legalized counterfeiting, whether its two percent a year or 20 percent. Dollar should be a fixed measure of value. Its simply a yardstick, to make transactions easier. Otherwise, its like a virus in a computer. It corrupts the information; you cant trust prices. You get a decline in personal incomes, weakening social trust, distortion and misdirection of investment into things that, hard assets instead of things of the future. And also as a transfer of wealth, to nations that are not very friendly to the United States. Whatever angle you look at, again, youre not going to make yourself wealthy by fooling around with the integrity of the U.S. dollar. There are other ways you do it, hard work, risk taking, and the like. Thank you.

Hes professor of banking and financial institutions at Columbia Business School.
America doesnt need a strong dollar policy|i2Debates/031313 strong dollar.p|305|R4|FREDERIC MISHKIN|for|1|32|9|0|0|33|0|40|0|0|2|6|33|14|0|4|9|0|0|0|0|248|2|0|0|0|1|1|7|0|0|1|21|0|0|6|6|0|0|0|36|0|9|21|60|16|44|12|60|0|0|0|0|0|27|26|0|1|12|21|60|3|2|3|29|419|So Im not going to use higher mathematics. In fact, thats never been really part of this discussion. But I do want to talk about history. And in fact, theres a very wonderful example about what happens when you pursue a strong currency policy. It happened to deal with a great man who was great in helping save the world against Hitler, but was not a very good economist. He was not a very good chancellor of the exchequer, which is the equivalent of the finance minister, or Secretary of the Treasury, and this is Winston Churchill. But what the U.K. decided to do after World War I, was to pursue a strong pound policy. They went back on the dollar -- on the pound -- excuse me, they went back on the gold standard in 1925. They started taking measures to do this starting right after the war. What was the result of this? Well, in order to do this they actually had very tight monetary policy, very high interest rates. Were they successful? Absolutely, in 1925, they went back on gold. What was the outcome? The outcome was, that we had, the British had very high unemployment, they went to over 11 percent employment in 1921. They then had extremely high unemployment all through the roaring 20s when everybody else was doing wonderfully. Then of course it got worse. But then even more important to the current situation, they actually were trying to be virtuous. They had 130 percent of debt, sovereign debt, of their government debt relative to GDP after World War I, because it was so costly to fight it, they actually pursued very, very large, a budget surpluses, excluding interest payments. What happened to them? Well, they went 140 percent of GDP in 1919, by the time you got to 1929, they were 170 percent of GDP. So indeed, in this current juncture, where in fact we have to worry about fiscal consolidation, this ended up doing several things. It meant it killed the economy. They actually had deflation. You talked -- Jim Grant talked about deflation as being a good thing during a period of American history. It certainly was not a good thing for the British. And what did you end up with? You ended up with a much more dire fiscal situation, even when there was virtue. A strong dollar policy would be something that would be very damaging to the economy and we do not need a strong dollar policy.

Were going to ask you to vote the second time now. Go to the keypads at your seats and register where you stand on this motion. After hearing the arguments, and well see how it compares to your vote before you heard the arguments. The motion is this: America does not need a strong dollar policy. The team arguing for the motion, to be clear, is the team that was against a strong dollar policy. If you agree with them, push number one. If you agree with the other team, America doesnt need a strong dollar policy is the -- actually I think Ive confused myself now. Ignore what I just said, because Im sure youve got it. You heard the argument. If youre with these guys, push number one. If youre with these guys, push number two. Im sorry. I knew it was going to happen at some point. But Ill just restate it. Our motion is, America doesnt need a strong dollar policy. If you agree with the motion, push number one. If you disagree, push number two. If you are, or remain, or became undecided, push number three. The system will correct any mis-push. The other keys are inactive and well have the vote in just a few seconds. But while the votes are being tabulated, I first of all want to say that the spirit and the energy and the entertainment value frankly of this rather potentially technical and arcane debate was terrific. It was a lot of fun and you made it really interesting. Thank you for all of that. And to be honest, a lot of times, I have to reject questions, and I don't like doing it. I didn't have to do it tonight. The questions were great. I even liked the elevator ride you took downstairs. Thank you for doing that, so to everybody who got up and asked a question, thank you to you as well. Your applause was robust and spontaneous throughout the evening. It was very, very helpful to us. So a few things I want to tell you about, first of all, we're encouraging anybody here to tweet about the debate, of course. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, @IQ2US. The hash tag for tonight's debate is #strongdollar. Our next debate in New York, our monthly debate, is on Wednesday, April 17. The motion that night will be, "The GOP must seize the center or die. " Steve, I'm just wondering if you had a reaction to that at all. Arguing in support of the motion, David Brookes, he's an op-ed columnist at the New York Times, and Mickey Edwards, he's a former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma. Arguing against the motion, Laura Ingraham, host of The Laura Ingraham Show, and Ralph Reed, chairman and founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. In about three weeks, we're going on the road. We're going to be in Washington, D.C. It's a special edition of Intelligence Squared. The motion that we'll be arguing on Wednesday, April 3rd, is, "Abolish the minimum wage. " You can get details and tickets to this and our remaining spring debates at our website, www.IQ2US.org. The side arguing to abolish the minimum wage is Jim Dorn and Russ Roberts. Arguing against, Jared Bernstein and Karen Kornbluh. For those who cannot join the live audience either here or in Washington, there are a lot of other ways to catch these debates. You can watch the live stream as I'm sure a lot of people are now on fora.tv. Thank you to all of you who are watching on Fora. And you can listen to these debates, and this one in particular, on NPR or watch it on PBS stations across the country. Just check your local listings for air times -- air dates and times. One other thing I want to tell you that normally we announce the results which I'm about to do -- for the first time, we're going to crunch the numbers in a different way. We're curious to see just in terms of the open-mindedness, and flexibility, and willingness to listen of the audience -- I mean flexibility, not in that way, but in a willingness to listen to other ideas -- we kind of wanted to see how many of you actually did change your positions, and how many of you voted the same way twice, how many of you voted different ways. What we're going to do is in the -- it takes a little time for us to crunch that. It'll probably take about five minutes. So after I announce the debates and after we've concluded, if you watch -- stay and watch these screens, it'll come up in a couple of minutes, just that analysis, if you have some curiosity about that. So here are the final results. We had you vote twice, both before you heard the debate and once again after you heard the arguments, and the teams -- the team whose numbers have moved the most are declared -- is declared our winner. So the motion is, "America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. " Here is the preliminary vote. Before the debate, 24 percent agreed with the motion, 29 percent were against, and 47 percent were divided. What did I do wrong? Oh, okay. I felt like my kids were laughing at me, and I wondered, "What did I do wrong? " So those are the first results. Remember now that you have voted a second time. The winner is the team that has changed their numbers the most from the first vote to the second. So we're going to look at the second vote on "America doesn't need a strong dollar policy. " The team arguing for the motion, their second vote, they got 54 percent. From 24 percent to 54 percent, that's an increase of 30 percentage points. That is the number to beat. So let's see if the team against -- Yeah, yeah, right. Team against, 29 percent before, they went to 37 percent, that's only eight percentage points they pulled over. It's not enough. The debate goes to the other side. The team arguing against a strong dollar policy has prevailed. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

They're about 80 percent Republican. The counterweight to that is blacks and unions on the Democrat side, but if the Republican Party alienates those people who are their most reliable supporters they just cannot win.

Let's welcome them to the stage and thank Bob Rosenkranz. Thank you. And I'd like to just invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making all of this possible. We all possess, you and I, all of us here, something that the ambitious, and the powerful, and the wannabe powerful keenly covet, and that is our votes. The rules say that political parties cannot have power unless they first have our votes, and when they fail to get them, as the Republican Party did in sufficient numbers in the race to the White House in 2012, it inevitably sets off soul searching within the party. How did we fail to connect to the American voter? Do we need to change to do better next time? That is the debate that's taking place right now inside the Republican Party, and we are bringing it out now onto this stage. Yes or no to this statement, "The GOP must seize the center or die," a debate from Intelligence Squared, U.S. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for and against this motion. As always, our debate goes in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner.

First, ladies and gentlemen, David Brooks. David, you are an op-ed columnist for the New York Times. In that position, often referred to as a moderate, you get a lot of flack from both sides. A few examples, the conservative blogger, Michelle Malkin wrote of you that you are "the Eddie Haskell of the fourth estate. " The liberal writer, Jonathan Chait writes that you are -- "David Brooks is now totally pathological. " My question to you, as somebody who's sort of getting it from both sides, does it hurt more when the zingers come from the left or the right to your bruised body?

You were not happy with how the Mitt Romney campaign went in 2012. And you said quite plainly that election should have been a "gimme," given the situation in the economy, among other things. And you said this: "if you can't beat Barack Obama with that record, then shut down the party. " How literally did you mean that?

Arguing on this motion, the GOP must seize the center or die, and here up to argue first in support of the motion, David Brooks. He is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times, a commentator on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer and a former senior editor at the Weekly Standard.
The GOP must seize the center or die|i2Debates/041713 gop.p|34|R2|DAVID BROOKS|for|14|39|18|1|1|106|0|101|3|0|17|4|149|53|0|15|21|0|9|3|0|657|6|0|0|0|18|11|40|0|3|12|69|0|3|21|14|6|0|12|43|13|9|62|161|93|140|14|136|0|4|4|2|14|106|75|0|23|15|29|159|5|3|13|86|1178|Now, I did this once before, and the competitive juices got going, and I turned into an insufferable jerk attacking the other side. So before I do that, I want to just express my love and admiration for my opponents. We came into this business together, Laura, the slowly aging portrait of Ralph that he keeps in his attic, and I -- And just complete admiration for them, the fact that they -- the Democrats have hired them to burrow within the Republican Party and to destroy it from within, I do not hold against you. Now, I admit I was on the left at one point. In the '60s, my parents took me to a "be in" where hippies would go just to be. And to demonstrate their liberation from money and material things, they threw their wallets into a garbage can. I was five. I saw a five dollar bill on fire in the garbage can. I ran into the fire, grabbed the money and ran away. And that was my first step over to the right in my life. Kept going. But we had one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants, lower east side, a Jewish kid trying to make it in the city. We had the attitude, the think Yiddish act British attitude, "We'll fit in. " We had the dream of making it in the city which meant making it in this neighborhood where we're standing, in the upper west side, the Upper East Side. And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started. It was started by Abraham Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it. And he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility. He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads. He got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, Homestead Act, Land-Grant College Act, even introduced the income tax. It was using government to give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed. And that was still around when I got there, when I got to Washington. Ronald Reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed. Reagan did it. Is the Republican Party doing it now? I think they have not because they've been so hostile to government. Ronald Reagan was more pragmatic than the current Republican Party. It's also no longer 1980. Now if you want to rise and succeed, it's not enough just to work hard and row a boat across the Ohio River like Lincoln. Think of a poor girl who wants to be like Lincoln today. She can't just work hard ferrying people across that river. She grows up probably without a father. She grows up in a chaotic community with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds. To succeed, she's probably going to need some language instruction. She's probably going to need some early -- some protection from early childhood distresses that'll destroy her self-control. She's going to need institutions that'll help her build relationships so she can use people as tools for learning throughout life. She's probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job. And so what does the Republican Party today have to say to her? Almost nothing. This party is encased in a simplistic and archaic metric, government versus the market. Government bad, the market good. If you're an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your central pain. If you're that little girl, the government is not your big problem. If you're that little girl, the government, through Pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping you work hard and becoming a better capitalist. Does the Republican Party offer anything? No, which is why Asian Americans, for example, voted against the Republican Party three times to one. The Republican Party has become so hostile to government that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer. So hostile to government they can't really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with. And so this is a party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its founding principle. And the country knows that. Republicans have lost five out of the last six popular votes in the elections. They've lost the Senate. They should have won. They held onto the House by force of redistricting. The Republican party has a 33 percent overall approval rating when the Democrats have 47 percent. You take every rising group in America. The Republican Party is losing that group. Latinos, by 4 to 1. Asian Americans, by 3 to 1. African Americans, by 9 to 1. People in single households by 2 to 1. They're getting slaughtered among young people. If this electorate, and the electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men -- white men, the party would be doing awesome. This party is not that party. This party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white America that's never coming back and has to move to recapture that. It has -- and what is the people's top criticism of the Republican Party? Recent Gallup poll this week, the top criticism is they do not compromise. So this is a party going down the drain. It's a party that's unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns, apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration. Bob Bennett of Utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the Senate for working with a Democrat. I had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the Senate - - terrified of getting primaried from the right. Unwilling to have any flexibility. Becoming an uncompromising party. To me, this is a party that has to tackle two big issues. The first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable. The second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that Charles Murray writes about. And my advice to the Republican Party: don't move to the center for the sake of moving to the center. The center is nothing. Move to the center for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility. Do right by that little girl and you'll do right by yourself politically. And that means having a positive agenda. It means being more flexible. It means being prudent and sensible, not a party of a red rump of America. And so, I don't necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism. But I want to call them back to their essence as a party. And so, I ask you to vote for the proposition. Thank you.

You know, I think for those of us who grew up in this party -- and I knocked on doors and walked precincts in my first campaign for a Republican candidate, 35 years ago -- we've seen this movie before. Virtually everything that David just said from that podium would have been said in 1949 after Dewey lost. It would have been said in 1965 after Barry Goldwater lost. It was said in 1977 after Ford lost. It's been said every time the Republicans lose a major election. And I would just say, paraphrasing Mark Twain, When it comes to the Republican Party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited, the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in decades. And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics. First of all, look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate, 117 in the House. Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after those devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure. And the party's brand then was even lower than it is now. 36 in the Senate, 144 in the House. Even after George H.W. Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by the way, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932. The Republicans at that point stood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House. You compare that to today where they have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question that the Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina. or Scott Walker in Wisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among the most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country, reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising taxes. The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level. And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level. The Republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010. They controlled both Houses of 24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats. So I tell you what the Democrats are going to find out. They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a lot of fun. For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack. For Nixon, it was Watergate and Vietnam. For Clinton, it was impeachment. For Reagan, it was the loss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra. And, of course, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq. Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's only been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in his second off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998. So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries. I'll quote you one from 1993. This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, "We should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and dying past. " Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. My second point would be we've tried this before. This formula's been applied. If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that once produced Nixon, Reagan, , and other great conservatives. They moved to the mushy middle. They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro- choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate. And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction, having followed these same policies that are being recommended now. Only 25 out of 80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate, following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally. And the other thing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie. If the Republican Party walks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of the electorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass- attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics. They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney. That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and the Union vote combined. And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles, those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party will become the Whig Party. One last thing because I'm running out of time. I'm an old high school and collegiate debater. Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate. And remember what this resolution says. It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to say become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the Democrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die. It doesn't say, "lose elections. It doesn't say, "under perform among minorities. " It says, "it will die. " Now, based on what I have just told you about the state of the Republican Party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution. Thank you very much.

You have heard the first two opening statements and now onto the third. To debate for this motion that the GOP must seize the center or die, a former eight-term Republican congressman from Oklahoma, vice president of the Aspen Institute and a founding trustee of the Heritage Foundation, ladies and gentlemen, Mickey Edwards.
The GOP must seize the center or die|i2Debates/041713 gop.p|39|R3|MICKEY EDWARDS|for|17|35|71|2|0|92|1|99|5|0|13|7|160|70|0|13|35|0|0|3|0|595|9|0|1|0|1|6|50|1|0|16|85|0|13|21|23|8|0|9|18|4|57|55|129|100|146|17|85|0|4|3|0|3|87|42|0|14|23|16|146|7|22|9|50|1054|John, thank you. Well, it's a great privilege to be able to be here at Intelligence Squared. Thank you very much for doing this. It's great to be here with my friend, David Brooks, and also to be here with my friends Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed who have devoted so much of their lives to fighting for principles they believe in. And I admire them both. I hope they lose badly, but I admire them both. I think the question here tonight is -- to put it even more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country well? And if they do not, if they do not stand for where America is and where America is going, what claim can they make for support from the American people who find a party that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is going to elect America's political leaders for years to come? The fact is, Ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from. It's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become. Let me be clear. I do not think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative. The problem is that what it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today. It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be. I spent a good many years championing the Republican Party and conservatism. Among the other things, besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election. And I have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change in the opposite direction. Americans still agree with conservative principles. They defend the right of citizens to own guns. But they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches. The people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes. You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the Republican Party. The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government, they say, No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase, who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil. You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work. And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it. Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes. And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe. So we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made. What does it mean to move to the center? I would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works. And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one America. That's what the American people don't see. That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party. So people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and nominates for office. Will it doom the Republican Party? You saw Barack Obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected. Laura has written that it's Mitt Romney's fault. Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people? It's the only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did. So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate. Everybody thought we would win control. Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate. In fact, they gained seats. Why did they gain seats? Because Republicans put up candidates that allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who -- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they just could not go there. So the other question is what it means to be a political party. And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of America. So what's really at stake here are two things: Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can survive, and second, whether it should. The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it, my party, will disappear, and it should. Please vote for the proposition.

And I have deep admiration for all of my co-panelist debaters. No snarky comments. All of them contribute to the dialogue, and I really appreciate the opportunity to be here. Last -- on Saturday, I was at the NRA 500. Do you guys know what that is? Anyone in Manhattan know -- it was a NASCAR race in Dallas. What a great country it is. I could be at the NRA 500, be here with you today. Is there any crossover audience, any people -- oh, none. Darn. I'm totally losing already. I'm a duck out of -- I'm a duck out of water, okay? I'm really a duck out of water here because for me, a centrist is someone who owns only two guns. Oh, come on. I have a question, if this thing is tied by the end, does the Supreme Court actually pick the winner like in 2000? Can we actually get Justice Scalia to write the opinion? I have to say that debating with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards, the politics -- David Brooks, an esteemed columnist for the New York Times, in New York is like -- it's like Barack Obama debating Wayne LaPierre about gun control at a gun show, okay? The odds are definitely stacked against us. But you must vote against this proposition. A couple of points first to Mickey's argument. If Mickey's argument is correct, then one would think that in the bluest of states, which would be very hospitable to moderate Republican views, quote, "centrist views," people like Scott Brown would be victorious. Scott Brown obviously went down in flames. One would think that someone like the very centrist Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin would have won his Senate seat. Unfortunately Tommy Thompson, thought of as a middle-of- the-road Republican, went down in flames. Republicans had their issues, but for every Todd Aiken and Richard Murdoch, I can cite a Republican moderate who could not make the grade. The proposition should be rejected because moderate Republicanism, going to this mythical center, has been tried, and it has failed repeatedly. Last two elections. The Republican Party already died. It died in 2000 with the elite's choice, which was John McCain. Remember, back then, Mitt Romney was the insurgent candidate. I supported Mitt Romney in 2008. He was going up against John McCain, who was for immigration reform. He worked for Ted Kennedy on a bunch of issues. He was for McCain-Feingold. John McCain was the media's favorite Republican. John McCain went down in flames. Move forward to the last election. Everyone said, The only guy who could beat Barack Obama would be Mitt Romney. Couldn't be that Rick Santorum. Certainly couldn't be Newt Gingrich. Gosh, Jon Huntsman, the other moderate Republican, he got no traction. Lo and behold, Mitt Romney ran. Mitt Romney lost. Moderates usually lose elections with few exceptions. And before you pull out the Chris Christie is a moderate and everybody loves him example, let me tell you what The New York Times said about Chris Christie in 2009: Chris Christie, described as plainly conservative on issues such as school choice, rolling back regulations, and very restrictionist on abortion. Chris Christie won the governorship of New Jersey with the help of people like yours truly, the early Tea Party and conservatives. He was no middle-of-the-road centrist when he won. The proposition should be rejected for another reason. The mythical center. The proposition misunderstands what the word center means. Think about this. You don't seize the center. You create the center. Think about this. George Bush saying that conservatives should be more compassionate. Or Marco Rubio saying that you have to agree with Chuck Schumer on immigration. You say that. I don't know what you -- what you've seen, but to me, it seems a little bit more weak than you would have seemed if you just said, You know, these are my views. Take them or leave them. But Barack Obama -- did he seize the center in, let's say, 1994? When Newt Gingrich was changing the face of Republican politics in 1994 or when Ronald Reagan was triumphantly winning elections in the 1980s, did young Barack Obama say to himself, Gosh, I've got to seize the center. I've got to move and adopt a new point of view, and a new tone, and a new idea, because guess what? Conservatism is all the rage. Unilateral disarmament is out the window. I need to seize the center. Of course he didn't do that. And he was very smart not to do that. Constantly changing viewpoints are a fact of life in the United States. They usually change when someone makes a coherent, strong argument that the status quo is unacceptable, that the policies that are being advocated by the other side actually don't help the American people. So that to say, seize the center or die doesn't mean anything. I can remember when the center was the Defense of Marriage Act. Barack Obama believed in that centrist position. So did Bill Clinton. So did Hillary Clinton. So did most Americans. The left found a new way to approach it and guess what? The center changed. I can remember when the center position was for the war in Iraq. David was a big supporter of the war in Iraq, as was I. But guess what? Facts changed. Circumstances changed. Arguments changed. The center changed. Does that mean that people who had a principled view about the war in Iraq should seize the center and just admit that the war in Iraq was wrong? If that happened and, David, you wrote that column, I must have missed that. The proposition should be rejected because it misunderstands what a political party is. Mickey touched on this -- and I agree with him on this point. A political party doesn't exist just to get elected, right? A political party exists to make people's lives better. Edmund Burke -- I'm sure a lot of fans of Burke out there. But Edmund Burke said that, Look. A political party is to implement certain agreed on principles. And by the way, it should -- you should reject the entreaties of the elites who will urge you to change your principles to fit the mood of the day. We saw, time and again, people who come across as flip-floppers. They want to change their views for political convenience. And time and again, those people are rejected as candidates. A party does not exist to win elections. If it did, then guess what? We would have a different scenario today in the United States, because, guess what? Flip- floppers don't win. Would anyone have agreed that the center position of -- about slavery -- you think slavery is a good thing? Slavery in America is a good thing? That was a centrist position in 1850 during the famous 1850 compromise. That center changed. And it should. We had Abraham Lincoln. He came around and guess what? He was a Republican --

Thank you, Laura Ingraham. And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is "The GOP must seize the center or die. " Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the debate. We're going to have you vote again at the end of the debate, and the team who's moved your views most in percentage terms will be declared our winner. Now we move on to Round 2, and that is where the debaters address each other directly, and they answer questions from me and from you in our audience. We have two teams of two arguing this motion, "The GOP must seize the center or die. " We have David Brooks and Mickey Edwards in support of the motion. We've heard them say that the Republican Party has become too hostile to government, that it is losing ethnic minorities and young people, and that those are two growing groups. They say that resistance to compromise is not a winning message and that the party has found itself at odds with the more diverse population. The side arguing against the motion, "The GOP must seize the center or die, Ralph Reed and Laura Ingraham. They've argued that the sky is not at all falling for the GOP, that the GOP is doing very, very well in the states and in local governments, that it has had these losing streaks before and has bounced back, and that never has a move to the mushy middle, as they called it, turned out to be a winning strategy, and if they tried and compromised their core convictions, they would alienate a base that is too large to be alienated. They would lose. I want to put a question -- I see that we're already debating this whole notion of what are we talking about when we say there is a center. And I want to put to the side arguing against the motion -- against the notion of compromise on this. You have said that the center is really a moving target; it can change by the month or by the year. One of your opponents, Mickey Edwards, put it a different way. He talked about the center as an approach to your opponents, an approach to the process, that it's a willingness to compromise, and that ultimately being willing to go to the center is a willingness to go to the common ground, and when you get there, that's where the center is. I'd like you to take that on and elaborate more on this debate about what we mean by "the center. " Laura Ingraham.

If you compromise over the core principles of your party, then you are ultimately representing nothing, and you might as well just be a shimmer or a figurehead, representing nothing. So compromise on, "Well, we're going to spend X amount of money versus Y amount of money," oh, that's compromise, I understand what you're saying. But when you say "seizing the center," that stands for a set of principles. In the liberal lexicon, seizing the center for Barack Obama never meant, "Okay, I'm going to actually now look at the way we spend our military money or the way we run our foreign policy differently. " He doesn't believe that's seizing the center. Compromise only exists when it sets about to erode conservative principles.

Mickey and I have talked about how to solve problems. Mickey talked about the problems of political dysfunction in Washington, and that's to start with a position and then behave in a prudential manner to try to ease political dysfunction in politics, and that's a centrist position, which involves the practice of patriotic service to the country, understanding there are two sides and both sides contain some truth. I talked about social segmentation, a problem that Charles Murray has talked about, a problem that I think can be addressed with limited but energetic government. We've talked about how to solve those two problems, so neither of us has talked about moving to the center --

It's about the party standing for the country. You know -- -- James Madison is my hero. I love Madison, the champion of limited government. But he was also for government. The Constitution was not just to put constraints on government but to empower government to act in a reasonable, rational way as a nation. This is not a collection of disparate ideas. This is a full-fledged nation of people who must come together if they're going to do anything worthwhile. Government doesn't have all the power. Government doesn't have all the responsibility, but government does have some responsibility. And that's where the Republican Party is copping out.

And what the resolution says is that the Republican Party must move to the center or die. Now, I haven't heard the other side define these terms. I offered my definition. I'll give you a further definition from Merriams, which is The center is the middle point that is equidistant to both end points on a sphere, okay? That's what the center is. So we're not going to let you off the hook by saying, you can be a conservative, but you've got to compromise. The resolution makes it very clear that the point to which you must compromise is the point that is equidistant between Democrats and Republicans. The resolution further says that if the Republican Party doesn't do that, that it will die. Now, ask yourself, if you're Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin, and you want to reform the pension program for public employees, because if you don't, it's going to bankrupt your stay. And then that young lady that David's so concerned about isn't going to be able to get any social services because the state's going to be bankrupt. And he offers a proposal that the public unions opposed. And then it goes to a vote. Where is the compromise? They tried to recall him. You want to know what? He won the recall election by a bigger margin than he won the original election because he stood on principle, and he didn't compromise away his principles.

I would say American greatness conservatism, which was at the crux of much of what David Brooks argued for during the Bush years, supporting a larger, more energetic federal government, supporting not only the war in Iraq, but the war in Afghanistan. It was an utter failure. It grew the deficit. It ended up losing the Republicans, their hard- fought gains in the Senate and the House of Representatives. And by the end of this moving to the center of the Bush administration, the Republicans had lost the House, the Senate and turned the White House over to the most liberal president ever to step foot in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. So the Republican Party moved to the center, David Brooks -- I like you very much -- and it got clobbered. And only when it moved away from the --

At IQ2 U.S. Let me put something else into the conversation here. And it was the argument made by the side arguing for motion, that the party as it now stands is losing touch with -- has lost touch with growing segments of the population, that part of the population being the young, maybe some segment of women and ethnic minorities. And I just want you to take that on. And Ralph Reed, I acknowledge your point, and I want to take it to the other side ultimately, that you're also talking about the basis, it cannot be alienated.

The candidates who do well among minority voters -- and, Mickey, I know when you were one of the most conservative members of the House, serving in the '80s, you regularly won large percentage of the African-American vote in your district. Conservatism is not anathema to minority voters. And in fact the high water mark in the post-World War II period for a Republican presidential candidate in winning Hispanic votes was George W. Bush in 2004. And if you look at that, he won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. You look at the Hispanics he did well among, he over-performed among self-identified conservatives. 40 percent of Hispanics self-identify as conservatives, 22 percent are Evangelical, another 25 percent are faithful Catholics, 2 million of them are small business owners. And that's how you win their votes. Bush won 75 percent of Evangelical Hispanics. They're pro-life, they're pro-marriage, they're for lower taxes. These are conservatives. So you don't -- it's not an either/or. You know, Mike Huckabee who is a pro-life, pro-marriage conservative, won 60 percent of the African-American vote in Arkansas.

She's almost eight years old. And I take this issue very seriously. And I take the issue of immigration seriously. I believe in it. I believe it adds enormously to the fabric of our society. But the resolution on the table is the Republican Party must move to the center or die. And we are arguing about George W. Bush only because George W. Bush is the most recent national example of a Republican that all the individuals under the age of 35 remember. If you're under 35, the only national Republican you really have any experience with is George W. Bush. And the last time I checked, George W. Bush drove up the deficit, got us involved in two wars that ended up being either badly explained or just wildly unpopular because they didn't seem like they were helping Americans at home and were not all that successful. And I will say that when he left office, he had -- I believe, the last approval rating he had was about 32 percent. The Republican Party was decimated between 2005 and 2008. And during those years, there was not a Tea Party. There was no Sarah Palin. This was no issue with the Tea Party influence. It was because we had an abysmally centrist and out of touch George W. Bush in the White House that the Republican Party has still not come to terms with.

So, I mean, you guys keep talking about the definitional problem, we're not defining the issue right, and yet you keep redefining conservatism. I mean, Ralph, I appreciate the fact that you pointed out that when I was running for Congress, and when I was there, I routinely carried the African-American vote by good margins. But, you know, a very interesting thing happened. There was a political scientist who did a study of me. I can't imagine why he would do that, but he looked -- and he compared my voting record with what it would be today. And he said, Holding things steady -- when I was in Congress, you're absolutely right. I was one of the most conservative members of Congress. And if I were in Congress today, voting exactly the same way on exactly the same issues, I would be one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress. It's the party that has changed. That's not the party of Reagan. It's not the party of Barry Goldwater. You know, it's -- this is a party that has become something different and unrecognizable, something that is at war with the American people, that's at war with people's rights --

I don't know about this resolution, but let me say this. I think Laura and I -- I'm not sure, but we -- I don't want to get too down the rabbit trail of immigration. But I think that it elucidates the disagreement we're having. They seem to be saying, or at least Mickey is, that it's okay to be a conservative, you just have to be willing to compromise. Well, as I understand it, that's not really the resolution. It goes without saying that in the legislative process, you have give-or-take. I mean, if you read this comprehensive immigration proposal that was released this morning, it has the toughest enforcement and border security measures in U.S. history. If you entered this country illegally, the soonest you can get a green card is 13 years. The soonest. For many, it'll be 20 years. And nobody -- but nobody under this bill moved ahead of the 4.7 million people who have played by the rules, obeyed the law, and are waiting in line right now. Not one. Now, that is not amnesty. And I -- even if you don't agree with the bill, I defy anybody to say that what Marco Rubio has done is seize the center. What he has done is he has -- as a brilliant legislator and he's very gifted -- and this is not just me talking. The president has said he's been a positive influence. Chuck Schumer called him a game-changer. He brought conservative principles to bear, okay?

Do not interrupt me, please. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat. Charlie Crist's positions in Florida were widely hailed by liberal Republicans and liberals, period. He also happened to be unseated by the Tea Party. I had Marco Rubio on my radio show in February of 2009. He was 23 points behind. I saw in Marco Rubio someone different from the Republican dinosaur establishment, the same people who had driven the party, from Bush on down, into almost oblivion. All the gains we won during Gingrich were lost almost under George W. Bush. Marco Rubio is a different type of legislator. It doesn't mean I'm going to agree with him on everything.

Government should be small. It should be limited, and it should be confined to specific enumerated purposes.

So ordered liberty is obviously the best. And a moral core, encouraging moral behavior, society changes, maybe society will change what the meaning of the world "moral" is, and I understand that.

So in the case of the civil rights and you cannot deny African-Americans, obviously you shouldn't, these rights, you know, that's a good thing. But denying gays rights, that's different, right? So, I mean, theres a point where you're not being consistent, are you for liberty, or are you for restrictions on liberty? Are you for a workable government, or are you against it? Are you for limited government or not? I mean, you're on every side of everything. That doesn't work.

They've not -- wait a minute. They've not been denied the right to vote. They've not been prevented to run for political office. If you believe that gays and lesbians were subjected to slavery and segregation and denied the right to vote for over 100 years after the 13th amendment granted them the right to vote, that has never happened in American history. So they are free in a free society to make moral choices with which I may disagree. Just by the way straights are. There are straight men and women who live together outside of wedlock, do so every day, and they're free to do so in a free society. I'm not going in there to try to interfere with their personal decision. The issue before the country is whether or not that relationship should be defined as the institution of marriage.

My mom was a waitress. I had a middle class lifestyle. I kind of gravitated toward Reagan. I didn't really have any reason to be political. But this guy was kind of an older guy, but he seemed to love America, and he thought government was kind of out of control. I saw my parents in these gas lines, and interest rates are really high. Parents couldn't make much more money. Listened to him and thought that message made sense. The Reagan experience was not without its pitfalls. Reagan did compromise on some issues. But that vision of conservatism, which was a happy warrior conservatism, which was unyielding in the face of the Soviet threat, which understood that the power of the individual, individual prosperity, was best achieved with a government that didn't get in the way. Those messages were clearly stated, mostly optimistically stated. But he could throw the punches when necessary. Reagan was a great example for me as a young person. I think as time went on, they had some successes obviously in the '90s. Republicans took the House of Representatives for the first time in 50 years in 1994. Seemed like we were back on track. And George Bush -- I mean, I sound like I'm beating up on George Bush, but George Bush comes along, I like him very much. We had an idea that Republicanism --

It took a lot longer than I thought. So Reagan raised taxes 14 times. He included the biggest tax hike in American history to that point. Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which was one of the bigger liberalizations of abortion laws. That didn't make him a moderate. It made him someone who was practical politician. And he fought for what he could and tried to get things done, but he was willing to address real problems and not govern on the basis of a prefab ideology.

So, well, maybe two ways. Ronald Reagan adjusted to the problems of his day. In the late 1970s, there was a stagflation. There was a global shift of overregulation. There was a global shift of government which really did stagnate the country. And Ronald Reagan, I think, responded very intelligently, along with Margaret Thatcher, to the problems of those days. The problem is the problem of 2013, it's not 1980, and the problems are different. And if you stay with some mythical, pure Reaganism, which includes no tax increases ever, small government all the way, which is mythical, then you are not responding to the problems of today.

It is an undeserved reputation, but it nonetheless is the case. But the fact of the matter is that what the Republican Party stands for, what it fights for and what it seeks to advance, is policies that will strengthen marriage, family, childbearing and rearing, so that young people are not left behind in circumstances where this young girl could end up finding herself. We seek policies that strengthen the family, because we know that if somebody gets married and stays married, bears children within the institution of marriage, and gets a job, any job, and graduates from high school -- that person that I just described, in the United States of America, you know what that -- what chance that person has of living in poverty? Two percent. You do the opposite of those four behaviors, you don't graduate from high school, you don't get your first job, you bear children outside the institution of marriage, you have an 85 percent chance of living in poverty. And I read Losing Ground. And Charles Murray's exactly right. But the sociology and pathology of poverty in America today is largely as a result of government policies that don't strengthen those institutions.

Number one, school choice, which we know dramatically increases parental involvement in a child's education, David. All the social science shows that if a parent can choose the school, that they're going to be more involved in that child's education. Secondly, we supported the $500 per child tax credit, which became $1,000 per child tax credit, which we made fully refundable. David, that is the most successful anti-poverty program in the last 30 years. It lifted 9 million people out of poverty last year. That was in the Contract With America.

You know, those are conservative. But I -- we used to call -- people used to call the Republican Party the "dumb party," and I tried to think, "Why is that? Why is it the dumb party? " So what happens when you have good ideas like the ones you just talked about, and you have the president of the other party and the Senate of the other party, and you want to advance toward what you say, but if they say, "Okay, let's find a compromise," you say, "No," and, therefore, you get nothing, instead of moving in the direction you're advocating, you get nothing. That's dumb. That's really dumb, and that's the reputation the Republican Party is getting.

Number one, on D.C. Opportunity Scholarships, I don't know if you guys know what that is, but that was a school choice initiative, wildly popular in my hometown of the District of Columbia. African-Americans, Latinos line up around blocks to get their kids enrolled in the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship. The centrist, Barack Obama, zeroed out -- approved the zeroing out of the money, pittance, I think it was $13 million, a drop in the bucket in our budget, for those families. Okay, so the idea that somehow that's compromise or that's -- there's all sorts of compromise going on, on the other side, not when it brooks the teacher's union, not when they're up against their people, so Republicans need to compromise and move to the center, but Democrats on issues like the unions and opportunity scholarships, there's no way they're going to do that. And on the point about the -- about the African-American point, I think it's an important one, I'd just like to say one brief thing, you're absolutely right. Republicans have been abysmal, from Romney, to McCain, and to pretty much everybody in between, about talking to people as people. They have different views. They have different values. That's okay. Rand Paul, Tea Party, not centrist Republican, is the first Republican to actually really go speak to African-Americans in a meaningful way. He did that last week at Howard University. He was booed for having done so, but I give him great credit for doing that. He began the conversation. I hope it continues, but you're making an absolutely important and valid point, and we have been terrible at that.

The first is you can be asked any question that the questioner wants to ask you. The second is you can answer it any way you want. And our candidates just didnt seem to fully grasp that second rule. They were given a choice of raise your hand. What they should have said was -- and I can't remember who the moderator was, you know, doesn't matter -- but you should say, "That offer will never come. There has never been a time in modern American political history where a Republican president has been offered a deal of a dollar in tax revenue -- new tax revenue for $10 in spending cuts, and it never will happen. And, by the way, you know, David was talking about the tax increase that Reagan signed in 1982, which was then the largest tax increase in American history. I was there. I was working in the U.S. Senate at the time. It was supposed to be $3 in spending cuts for every dollar in tax increases. Reagan signed it. All the taxes went up. The spending never got cut. He never got the spending. He went on to say it was one of the biggest mistakes he made as president. And that's why. If you look at what Obama's proposed, it's basically dollar for dollar. Now at a time when we're spending a trillion dollars a year that we don't have, Republicans are not going to agree to that kind of ratio.

If he had consulted -- if they had asked him before they raised the hand question, he would have given that good advice of how to dodge it. But they didn't just dodge that. They didn't just answer that question. They raised their hand, and then they defended it for the rest of the campaign. They defended the position that $10 in spending was not worth $1 in tax increases. They support that. They believe in that, they talked about it. It was a perfect example of the sort of absolutist position; a position of preference that a lot of us have that taxes shouldn't go up turned into an absolute fetish. And as a result, this party is incapable of reaching a budget deal. Now, I don't support all the budget deals that were out there, but a couple years ago, they were given a budget deal of $3 to one, $3 of spending cuts to $1 of tax increase. That, to me, was the no-brainer of the century. Take that deal. They didn't take the deal. They lost the election. Now we're down to maybe one to one. This is a party that's incapable of getting to yes.

Is that right, two budgets in five years. The last one late. I think it's the first time a president delivered a budget that late in modern history, or maybe ever. And the president's first budget got a total of zero votes for his budget, which apparently would be filled with compromise and moving to the middle and understanding governance and all of that. Got no support. And it doesn't look like his current budget is getting any support either. So the idea that the Republicans are sitting there as this -- as this buoy in the water, and it will not tact to one direction or the other. It's ridiculous. The Republicans have tons of problems, believe me. But the idea that if they -- again, the proposition on the table, they have to move to the center or die.

And I think it's an obligation of the Republican Party, of conservatives, to recognize that if you're going to fight against things that might do harm, might do danger, you know, that one of the things you have to look at is what's happening in the environment and what you need to do to secure our safety in that regard, too.

You should know that the Eurozone has adopted what this administration has proposed; a cap and trade system where you have permits that trade carbon emissions back and forth across industries and factories and even across country lines. What are their CO2, emissions up roughly over the last two years? 4 percent. We don't have a cap and trade system. Our carbon emissions have fallen by about 1 percent per year without it. You know why? Because we've incentivized corporations to adopt cleaner technology without going to that system. So we clearly oppose a cap in tax system which one study would show, through higher utility bills, higher gasoline, and higher built-in energy prices for everything from keeping your home warm to running a factory or a manufacturing establishment, will be a $1,800 tax on every family of four in America.

The electorate in '80 was 88 percent white. Today it's 73 percent white. I think we've already stipulated that we need to do better among minority voters, younger voters, single voters. We can do that with conservative policies. That's the disagreement. We all agree we need to do better among minority voters. You can do it by talking about conservative policies.

And apparently it was because of the mushy moderate policies of Pete Wilson and others. What I don't remember is Pete Wilson proposing a restrictionist immigration reform and destroying the Republican Partys chances among Latino voters in California. And that's what destroyed the Republican Party in California. I sit here this week, and I watch the Republican Party learning from the lesson of California and trying to do the same thing nationally.

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is "the GOP must seize the center or die. " And remember, we had you vote just before, and we're going to have you vote again right after closing statements which we're going to move to immediately. Onto Round 3, closing statements by each debater in turn. Those statements are two minutes each. Our motion is "the GOP must seize the center or die. " And here to summarize his position against this motion, Ralph Reed, the founder and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.
The GOP must seize the center or die|i2Debates/041713 gop.p|355|R4|RALPH REED|against|4|17|3|1|0|23|0|34|0|0|3|1|70|32|0|10|26|0|0|0|0|217|6|0|1|0|1|2|15|0|0|6|27|0|0|6|11|1|0|1|15|1|2|22|42|31|54|10|29|1|0|0|0|0|40|16|1|14|7|6|57|7|0|5|19|347|Well, I want you to remember when you vote tonight, that we're not voting on whether or not Republicans ought to compromise more, whether or not they ought to work with members of the other party to find common sense solutions. That's not what we're debating. We're debating whether or not the Republican Party philosophically should move from where it is to a point equidistant the two parties. And if it does not do so, it will die. Now, we have lots of data to demonstrate that that's not true. I've mentioned some of it tonight. Look at the exit polls in 2012. People asked whether or not they thought government was too big and was doing too much or whether or not they thought was government was too small and was doing too little. And a majority of Americans said government was too big and was doing too much. 41 percent of the electorate was conservative, only 23 percent liberal. I mentioned earlier that a plurality of Hispanics are conservatives. Only 23 percent of Hispanics are self-identified liberals. Now, the Republican Party may need to talk about these issues more effectively. You know, I think about what Oscar Wilde said. You know, sometimes you can tell somebody they're going to hell in such a way that they want to get there as rapidly as possible. And sometimes the Republicans have done that. But we're not talking here tonight about better candidates, better candidate performance. The gentleman who asked the question about engaging and connecting with minority communities, you can do all those things and remain an authentic, genuine, Reagan-style conservative. And if the Republican Party doesn't do that, if it moves to the mushy middle, if it tries to trim its ideological sails and tries to be simply a Democrat-lite, then the tens of millions of people who lick the envelopes, and knock on the doors, and make the phone calls, the volunteers who turn out on the -- on these primaries -- they will walk away from this party because it walked away from them.

Ralph has his . Laura has her animus to George Bush. I want to go back to the little girl I mentioned. I want to go back to the high-tech entrepreneurs looking for a worker. I want to go back to the young person saddled with debt, the gay or lesbian person in a relationship who wants to solidify that relationship within the covenant of marriage. The party that doesn't serve the people is going to die. The party that doesn't serve the contemporary problems of the age is going to die. Those are some of the people who have to be served by a party in order for it to survive. I'm a conservative. I have some doubts. I have a lot of skepticism about government. But you have to use government in limited and energetic ways to serve those people that I've mentioned. You have to be willing to compromise to get a budget deal so the young person is not saddled with millions of dollars of debt. You have to be able to work for a comprehensive immigration reform so that the high- tech worker can get a job, so the young people living in the shadows have some chance of dignity in their lives. You have to be willing to use government in limited but energetic ways to re-weave the social fabric so the young girl living a few miles from here can grow up in a neighborhood that's orderly, so that people can have jobs with earnable wages, so that people have an incentive to marry, some of them men who are now drifting through society. And that takes more government than I would have thought 10 years ago. But that is the problem that's out there. And that's the problem we have to deal with. So, I may have moved more toward the center since I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page or the National Review. But I think I've done it because the problems have changed. And some of those problems demand a little more government action. And if you're stuck, unwilling to use government in any of those problems, then your party will die.

And it's the top shelf stuff, not the stuff they were -- I want to start by saying -- you're not going to believe I'm saying this. But I'm going to say you should reject this proposition that the Republican Party should seize the center or die because I have a lot of faith and respect in the decision-making that Barack Obama made when he could have gone that way. He could have, himself, seized the center. He could have seized it in 1985 when it looked like liberalism was on the run. He could have seized in 1994, when this Newt Gingrich guy just took the country by storm, love him or hate him, but changed the face of politics. He could have given up hope in 2001 and 2002 when the whole country was rallying toward this war in Iraq, and he decided, "You know something? It's -- in my view, it's the wrong thing to do. Because the establishment and everyone around him was probably telling him, "The center has moved. You've got to go that way. " He didn't go that way. He had a certain set of principles. I disagree with him deeply, but he had a certain sense of himself and sense of principles that he decided to follow, and he followed in a new way by reaching out to all those disaffected Democrats who were kind of tired of the old way and Republicans who were kind of sick of where the Republicans were falling down. And, lo and behold, Barack Obama, by not seizing the center, unseated the establishment candidate of, of course, Hillary Clinton, decided, "Guess what? Liberalism is back. I never let it go. I never moved to the center, and I'm going to bring along constituency after constituency in looking at the world and the country in a new way. " He found his center. Republicans, guess what? They know where they -- what they believe and how they believe it. Seizing the new center is political death. Please reject the proposition.

The GOP must seize the center or die|i2Debates/041713 gop.p|363|R4|MICKEY EDWARDS|for|0|9|12|0|0|32|1|31|1|0|0|4|51|25|0|4|16|0|0|2|0|178|7|0|0|0|0|2|17|0|0|3|31|0|2|0|10|1|0|3|0|0|10|17|28|27|49|8|24|0|0|0|1|0|27|17|0|3|5|8|41|8|4|1|12|285|I should support the other side so that Laura will buy the margaritas. Look, there's just one simple question on the table. It's not whether Ralph and Laura are good people, which they are, who believe strongly in their positions or whether those positions are defensible. I'm a conservative, too. I agree with a lot of the positions they've taken. But it's whether or not they are positions that can gain in total the support of a very diverse nation. The Republican Party we have today could disappear and be replaced by a range of its little subsets, all these other -- a Christian right party, a libertarian party, a no government, no tax party, a gun owner's party, a no gays and no immigrants party, each one with its own small niche of true believers, but America would no longer be a single nation of people standing together, and for the purposes of this discussion, then you will have lost. The Republican Party that once served as a viable noble alternative, a serious part of the national conversation will be, like the Federalists, the Whigs, and the know-nothings, irrelevant and disappeared. That is not an end that we should embrace, but as long as the Republican Party remains a coalition of extremes outside the broad range of reasonable discourse, that's precisely what will happen. We political people are kind of self-referential; we like to think of ourselves as thinking it's all about us, but it's not about us alone. It's not about just what we think. This is a big diverse nation, and a political party that gets smaller and narrower as the country gets larger and broader is a party that is doomed.

And that concludes our closing statements. And now it's time to see which side you feel has argued the best. We're going to ask you again to go to the keypads by your seats and vote your view now on this motion, "The GOP must seize the center or die. " If you agree with the side arguing for the motion, push number one. If you disagree with the motion, vote for that side, push number two. If you're undecided, became undecided, remained undecided, push number three. You can ignore the other keys and we'll have the results in about two minutes actually. And so, while we're doing that, I just -- I want to ask your attention for a moment because this could have been a very ugly debate and it wasn't. It wasn't. I think all four debaters came to the stage respecting the fact that there are arguments on the other side. They played it that way. This was a good, honest exchange of ideas, and I think progress was made just in understanding where both sides stand. I'd like to give a round of applause to all of them.

You hit the target. Thank you to all of you for doing so. And I love this. I think this is the first time it's ever happened -- and forgive me for typecasting, but I -- you know, I think it's the first time we've ever asked a probably overwhelmingly liberal audience to choose between these conservatives and these conservatives. So that must have been a challenge. Wed love you to keep Tweeting about the debate. We know you've been doing it all along. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US. Our hash tag tonight is #GOP. Our next debate is here in New York. It's on Wednesday. It's May 8th. The motion is "the FDA's caution is hazardous to our health. " Arguing for that motion, we'll have Scott Gottleib. He served in various capacities at the FDA. Most recently, he was the director of medical policy development there. His partner will be Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan institute. He has also debated with us in the past and was terrific on this stage. Arguing against them, Jerry Avorn; he is a professor of medicine at Harvard who believes that when it comes to drug safety, the FDA is not doing well. And David Challoner is his partner; he is chair of an institute of medicine committee that found the FDA's medical device clearance process to be fundamentally flawed. Tickets are still available for this one. The 19th we will be in Washington, D.C. in partnership with the McCain Institute for International Leadership. We're doing a debate there with this motion: "Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. " For more information, you can visit our website, www.iq2us.org. And as I set at the beginning, we're on NPR stations, PBS stations here in New York, across the nation. We're a podcast. Download us, talk about us. Come back next time. All right. All right. It's all in. Remember, the way we do this, we have you vote twice and the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Our motion is "the GOP must seize the center or die. " Here are the results from before you heard the arguments. 65 percent of you agreed with the motion. 14 percent were against. 21 percent were divided. Those are the first results. Remember, the team that changes its numbers the most from first to second vote is the winner. So let's go to the second vote. Let's first look at the team arguing for the motion. They went from 65 percent to 65 percent. They picked up -- They picked up zero percentage points. Zero is the number to beat. The team against the motion, their first vote was 14 percent. Their second vote was 28 percent. They went up 14 percentage points. That's enough. The motion, "The GOP must seize the center or die" has been defeated. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and

We started talking about this months ago. We worked through a lot of topics. We found out -- we came to the conclusion that this was the one that was really going to be the one that fit both our sets of values and agendas for the kinds of things that we need to be out there in the public discourse. And for that reason, at this point, I would like to bring to the stage, representing the McCain Institute, Ambassador Kurt Volker. Let's welcome him to the stage.

As you heard, my name is Kurt Volker. I'm the executive director of the McCain Institute. We are a part of Arizona State University, and this event is not only on radio but being live streamed back to Arizona, watched by students there on ASU TV, among other things. One of the missions that the McCain Institute set for itself as we established ourselves over a year ago was to bring back a culture of reasoned structured debate about the core challenges facing our country. We embarked on a series of debates. One on Syria, should we intervene or not; one on Afghanistan, should we be getting out or not; what do we do about Iran? And this was the first time that we are partnering with Intelligence Squared. And we are delighted to be able to do so. It should be a very lively debate about a critical issue that is, again, facing our country: What do we do about our defense budget? We'll be doing more of these in the fall as well. Senator McCain wishes that he could be here for this debate at the beginning, but as you may know theyre dealing with immigration issues on Capitol Hill this evening, and so hes over there for that. We do hope that he would be able to join and say a few words by the end. With that, I want to turn it back to our Intelligence Squared organizers and thank you all very much for coming.

So I would like to welcome to the state, warmly, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. So, Bob, we've been around the country in the past year. We've been to Chicago, we've been to Aspen. A lot of the time we're in New York City. We're back in Washington for the second time this year. I just want to very briefly touch on the notion of bringing to this process the kind of very structured debate with rules and rounds and timing and a winner and a loser. What does that bring to the discourse?

They're forced to respond in real time to challenges. They're forced to respond to facts that either support or undercut their positions. And they're trying to persuade an open-minded audience to change their minds. So in many ways, it's reminiscent of the debates on the floors of Congress.

So let's talk a little bit about this debate that we're having right now in this era of mandatory cuts coming for the Pentagon budget. The team that's arguing for this motion -- and the "for" side is saying that the cuts really are a threat to national security, or a gift to our enemies, as we're putting it. What do they have going for them in this argument?

We live in a world where we're facing a much more assertive China. We live in a world where radical Islam seems to be in the ascendancy, and many countries in the Middle East. We live in a world where a lot of people who really wish us ill are trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. So we're in a very dangerous environment, and we need a very strong defense in order to be secure at home and exercise leadership abroad.

And that there is a lot of waste and inefficiency in the defense department. They're going to point to the fact that civilian employees in a bureaucratic kind of capacity have grown in numbers far faster than deployable forces. They're going to point to the fact that in a lot of procurement programs they're really driven by politics and job creation more than by any kind of strategic thought or necessity.

A little bit of a preview. And let's now welcome our debaters to the stage. So we're about to begin. And, as I mentioned, for the sake of the radio broadcast, there may be points in the broadcast where I repeat certain things over and over again like telling you that my name is John Donvan; that would be because we're coming back from breaks. And also it will be helpful when we come back from breaks if I could encourage you to applaud spontaneously -- -- at that moment, and I'll just let you know that this is the time when I really need you to do that. So the two times when that's the case, we'll be coming back from these breaks, and I'll raise my hand like that. And the other will be in a moment whether I introduce each of the debaters, when I mention their names for the first and then the second time. It would also be terrific if you can applaud. So -- 6,768. That is the number of war ships in the U.S. Navy in the waning days of the second World War. 288 ships. That is the number of ships in the U.S. Navy in the opening days of 2013. And it's about 25 fewer than the Navy says that it thinks it needs. 215. That is what a Secretary of Defense warns that the Navy will shrink to because of budget cuts from the so-called sequester. And the Navy hasn't had a Navy that small since 1915 when our war ships burned coal to get around. Obviously, times change. Military strategies change.

Yes or no to this statement: Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. A debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. in partnership with the McCain Institute for International Leadership. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two. They will argue for and against this motion. Our debate goes, as always, in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. Our motion is, Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. " Let's meet the team arguing for the motion. First, ladies and gentlemen, Thomas Donnelly. And, Thomas Donnelly, you are a co-director of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. You actually took part in an exercise, a kind of game, hosted, in fact, by your partner at the table, there at his think tank, where you were asked to rebalance the Defense Department's portfolio of weapons and capabilities on a reduced budget. And when you began your presentation, you said, "All I can offer you are roads to failure. " So does that mean you're just a pessimist or

Ben, you're a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the Cato Institute. You would like us to have a lighter military footprint around the world. And while you don't like the method necessarily, you think sequestration can be a good thing. Does that mean you are the sequester's only friend in this town?

" You were director for defense strategy and requirements on the National Security Council under President Bush.

And behalf of my partner, Tom Donnelly, I'd also like to thank compliment our worthy adversaries, without whom we could not have a debate here tonight. Tom and I, in terms of this proposition, believe that further cuts in our defenses will encourage our adversaries, and at the same time, increase the risks to our security, our economic well-being, and the security and economic well-being of our allies and partners around the world. In terms of the overall perspective -- but let's take a look at the big view. At the end of the Cold War, 20 years ago, we were spending, on average, 6 percent of our GDP every year on our defenses. Six percent. Okay? In the span of 20 years, this year, we're down to three percent of our GDP being spent on defense. So we have cut in half the amount of our national wealth that we have devoted to our defenses, okay? I don't think you can find another major part of the federal budget where you have this kind of cut. So, that's point number one. Point number two is if you look at the defense budget, you see several, I think, important things. One is 30 days ago this year, we decided -- we made a social choice, to adopt a volunteer military. And we never really fully paid the price of that choice until after 9/11, when we engaged in a protracted conflict in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. In order to recruit and retain sufficient members of -- service members to conduct those operations, we've had to increase personnel spending by over 50 percent, after inflation, since 9/11. So that's a dramatic increase. On top of that, the Obama Administration has set forth a revised defense plan which looks to cut nearly half a trillion dollars out of our defenses over the next 10 years. So what do you get? You get a shrinking defense pie, number one. Number two, within that shrinking pie, you get an expanded slice for personnel costs. What does that mean? That means in the coming years, we're going to see a lot less funding for training, a lot less funding for maintaining our equipment, and a lot less money for replacing all the worn out equipment. I've been to this movie before. This is the equation for a hollow military. This is the equation for a military that gradually loses its effectiveness and capability. Now, how will our enemies react to this? Is this a gift to them? I don't know. I'm not -- I'm not privy to their thoughts. What I can tell you is that the silence is deafening. And as Napoleon once said, When your enemy is in the middle of making a great mistake, don't interrupt them. And again -- so you have this particular situation. Now, some people say, Well, gee. We're pulling out of Afghanistan. We're out of Iraq. Let's reduce defense spending. After all, the threat is diminishing. Well, first of all, our operations in those conflicts were funded by something called OCOB, the Overseas Contingency Operation Budget. And those budgets are coming down and will go down to zero. But the base defense budget --- typically, when you draw down that budget, that is when the threat is declining. And as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we're in a situation right now where the threat is not declining. He had a pretty good short list, but there's a longer list we can go through. John mentioned that we brought together four think tanks, from the moderate liberal to the moderate conservative, a few weeks ago to look at the sequestration cuts. And these are cuts -- let's -- hey, let's cut another half trillion dollars out of defense over the next decade. Despite the fact that there's a fair part of the political spectrum that was covered, there are two conclusions that the four think tanks agreed upon: The first is that cuts of the magnitude that are discussed and put forth in sequestration will be a disaster in terms of our military readiness and capability. Second, there is a belief -- again all four think tanks -- belief that the dangers to our security, the dangers to our economic well-being are increasing over time. We've cut our budget since the end of World War II in the past, it's been when the threat's been declining, not when the threat's been increasing. So to sum up, those who advocate further cuts to our defenses as a way to put the fear of God into our enemies, kind of remind me of what the duke of Wellington once said about his own troops. He said, "I don't know if they scare the enemies, but by God, these people scare the hell out of me. " Thank you.

Cutting the Pentagons budget is a gift to our enemies|i2Debates/061913 pentagon budget.p|26|R2|BENJAMIN FRIEDMAN|against|4|32|40|7|0|66|2|101|0|0|4|2|191|53|3|22|30|0|2|2|0|651|10|0|0|0|0|4|76|0|1|23|80|3|13|7|15|9|0|4|12|6|20|116|141|107|206|24|113|0|1|4|0|0|114|68|1|31|9|25|149|75|4|9|60|1088|Andrew, it's a great honor to be able to frighten you. That's one of my more impressive achievements. I think if we cut the Pentagon budget to zero, sure, that would be a gift. But the cuts that are on offer in our political system are a different story. The president right now wants to spend roughly $550 billion on defense, including -- that's national defense, budget function 050. That doesn't include the wars. Under sequestration, under the cap that we have in place for this coming fiscal year, that'd have to come down about 50 billion. And over the decade, we'd spend 4.8 trillion on defense instead of 5.3 trillion. We'd still account for over 40 percent of global military spending and spend more than we did at most points during the Cold War in real terms. GDP measures -- the percentage of GDP measures what percentage of wealth we're spending. But, of course, our economy's been growing that whole time. We spend -- we're seven times wealthier than we were in 1950 or something like that. So if that amount of spending is a gift to our enemies, it's sort of a crappy first night of Hanukkah type gift, like sweat socks or toothpaste. I think our enemies are too far behind for it to matter much. They're sort of small potatoes, historically speaking, especially when you consider our wealth, our technological prowess, and our geographic advantage; these oceans around us and our weak and peaceful neighbors. Our biggest threat right now, according to pretty much everyone, is a scattered and increasingly pathetic remnant of the al-Qaeda terrorist movement thats failed to do much since 2001 except scare us into terrorizing ourselves. And even if you don't buy that take, you ought to recognize that aggressive counterterrorism operations with drones, with special operations forces, intelligence galore requires only a tiny fraction of our military budget. And our state enemies, North Korea, Iran, Syria, they're brutal regimes that pose little threat here. They lack the capacity to conquer their neighbors, let alone come over here and harm us. Russia, if you want to consider that an enemy, of course, has a lot of nuclear weapons, but with a dwindling population, a rusty conventional military dependent on an economy that's about equal to the Iberian Peninsula's, its days of threatening Western Europe are long gone, whatever we do. Now, China is a bigger issue. I'm sure it will come up a bunch here. But they spend about a third of what we do on defense, on the military. And most of that goes to ground forces that are largely irrelevant to a naval and air war that we might have with them if we had any war. We have 11 carriers. They have one that they practice on. Their much heralded anti-ship, ballistic missile capability which is supposed to be a threat to our ships, at the moment remains quite vulnerable to various countermeasures that we have. And I think maintaining that edge is not a problem of absolute resources. More important, China's a trading partner, not a real enemy, that we have no good reason to threaten unless were eager to fight a war over disputed Pacific rocks which we're not. I think we should hedge against China's rise not by surrounding it with our forces, which likely encourages its military buildup, but by staying rich and avoiding debt and keeping a technological edge to allow a buildup later if need be. I think the real question, when it comes to military spending is what's best not for our enemies, or worse for our enemies, but what's best for us. And I think what we want is the cheapest possible military that can defend our shores, that can keep trade routes open in times of duress. And fulfill the balancing function, that long guided British and then U.S. military policy for a long time. It is to prevent a big rival from emerging overseas that can conquer our friends and threaten us. And I think we can do that quite easily with very little overseas military presence right now. What the other side wants from our military is global dominance, which I think is not really possible. They'll say that current or greater spending is necessary to our military strategy which is primacy, which is to be a sort of globe girdling policeman. And that strategy is necessary to global stability. And I think both parts of that statement are wrong. First, we could do essentially what we do in the world now in terms of our alliances, naval patrols, bases, at a substantially cheaper cost. I think you could trim at least 50 billion off the defense budget and do all the stuff we do now. I can't explain the details of how you get there, but a good place to start, if you're interested, is Dr. Krepinevich's Foreign Affairs article from I think it was February this year that says we'll shift a bunch of money out of the army into the Navy. I think that's a good idea. I think you could also look at the joint letter that those -- a number of think tanks signed on to that had a bunch of efficiency savings, including another round and personnel cost reform. We're not destined to spend what we do right now on personnel. And both my opponents signed that letter. Second, global peace and trade I think would be fine if we adopted a more of a restrained strategy, and we'd be safer for it by staying out of avoidable trouble. You know, the -- this argument sort of reinterprets the Cold War. We didnt get into the Cold War to make global stability or secure international system. We were defending Europe against communism. We were defending some of our Asian allies against communism. And then our allies got rich. And we invented a new rationale for what we're doing. And so the new story is we agree to defend them, and they agree to let us. But I think our allies now have the capacity to defend themselves, and we ought to let them do that. And I think what we'll see that happens is a stable balance of power in Asia. And in Europe, there's basically no threats, so that's not a problem. But we'll see a stable balance of power. And as for trade, trade routes, we don't really defend them now. There's very little military protection of them.

Ladies and gentlemen, Ben Friedman. And here's a reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion: Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. You have heard two of the opening statement and now onto the third. Debating in support of the motion that cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies, Thomas Donnelly. He is co-director of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Donnelly.
Cutting the Pentagons budget is a gift to our enemies|i2Debates/061913 pentagon budget.p|32|R2|THOMAS DONNELLY|for|4|28|44|7|0|74|0|94|8|0|3|7|132|49|7|14|23|0|0|6|0|524|9|4|2|1|0|8|49|0|1|7|77|0|13|6|16|10|2|3|12|9|30|64|97|97|156|19|76|0|0|3|3|0|87|49|0|11|1|13|131|40|0|6|56|794|Thanks, John. I'd like to echo the thanks that my colleagues gave to the IQ people and the McCain Institute people. I'd like to thank the audience too. It's a beautiful day and coming in here and talking about defense budgets is perhaps not the way I would spend my afternoon if I had a choice. The smartest soldier of all time said that everything in war is simple, but the simple things are difficult. And this debate is a perfect example of why that's true. We're really talking about three things and how they relate to one another. We talk about money and budgets. And you've already heard a fog of numbers being thrown out and slices of pies being alluded to. It's a lot of money that we're talking about. But I would ask you to consider defense spending in a different way, as not just a cost proposition but a value proposition. Are we getting a return on our investment that's worth it as taxpayers and Americans? I would say absolutely. Andy says for 3 cents out of our dollar, whether we're getting the global dominance that Ben suggested or merely treading water, we have a remarkably peaceful world. There hasn't been a great power war since the end of World War II. And personally, I would like to keep it that way. That's something that I can't quite put a price tag on. And what we're spending now is certainly affordable. So ask yourselves, is it worth the money we spend? That's the way I would ask you guys to consider the proposition. Second part is even more unpleasant, the idea that we have enemies in the world. We don't like to think that as Americans. You know, we wish everybody loved us and we try to love them, but it is a dangerous world. Ben sort of downplayed all the threats that are out there. We're going to have a discussion about that. Reasonable people can differ over who's the biggest threat and what the size of the danger is, but, again, do you want to take a risk with this? If we're much stronger than our enemies, is that a bad thing? They're not all enemies. There're people who are sitting on the fence one way or the other. I would prefer to live in a world where we have fewer enemies and the ones that might be enemies don't want to mess with us. And, again, I think that's a great value proposition. The final part of the proposition is whether it's a gift to our enemies or not. As Andy said, "We don't know whether it's a gift, but it is already, we can tell, a dangerous temptation," as we see in the Middle East today. As we have come home from Iraq and we're about to depart from Afghanistan, we see in Syria a war that's metastasizing, it's like the Iraq civil war that we saw in 2006, only on steroids, much more so. So is that a gift to our enemies? I don't know. It's not a gift. Going to war is never a gift. Our withdrawal from the world after World War I was not a gift to Germany and Japan but it was a dangerous temptation to Adolf Hitler and to the Imperial Japanese. World War II was a gift to nobody but it was a necessary thing to do and a temptation to evil people in the world, and there are evil people in the world. So well work through all these questions. I like it that we have allies. They provide the battlefield. That -- you can't put a price tag on that. It's better to fight over there than it is here at home. So having America be powerful as well as be engaged in the world out there in the world has created a world that's more prosperous, that's safer, and for Americans possibly the most important point is freer than it has ever been in human history. We should not give that up. You don't win prizes in war for being the guy who does it in the cheapest way. There are no style points. The outcome is what matters, and that's what we should be focusing on when we weigh this proposition. Is it a gift to our enemies? No. That is a temptation to them, it's a risk for our friends, and it could be a real danger to us. We send very few Americans -- we have -- the world is so peaceful, and our military is so good that it only takes less than 1 percent of us to maintain the peace. I think that's worth a priceless investment, almost. Vote for us.

Cutting the Pentagons budget is a gift to our enemies|i2Debates/061913 pentagon budget.p|34|R2|KORI SCHAKE|against|11|27|27|4|0|68|3|78|0|0|17|7|146|49|0|14|18|0|0|1|0|506|7|0|2|0|0|10|55|0|0|14|44|0|27|13|16|5|0|5|13|3|15|84|115|81|137|24|79|0|0|1|0|0|92|46|0|15|13|10|114|49|2|10|45|868|So I agree with everything Tom Donnelly just said, and I think you can still agree with Ben and me that cutting defense spending is not a gift to our enemies without compromising anything Tom just said. And let me try and walk you through why I think that's so. First, as most of you probably know, 31 cents of every dollar the United States government spends, it borrows. We may only spend 3 percent of it on defense, but 31 percent of it, we have to borrow. Our national debt, the extent to which our spending is outpacing our revenue, that's the gift to America's enemies. We actually really need to bring our spending into alignment with our revenue, and the defense budget has doubled since 2001. The sequestration, the means by which we are further reducing it is damaging, but the reduction in the top line, the overall level of spending is manageable while maintaining a strong national defense, while retaining allies, while retaining the value proposition, and while frightening our enemies. The United States constitutes -- our own defense budget is 40 percent of global defense spending. 40 percent, all by itself. There are 21 aircraft carriers in the fleets of the world's navies. Eleven of those are in our navy. American dominance in the military realm is overwhelming. Of all the places you could cut spending -- in fact, the margin for error in national defense is enormous. As Tom said, the value proposition that the American military provides: we can do things that other militaries cannot do and that drives our enemies to radical, asymmetric strategies. It drives them to terrorism. It drives them to cyber warfare. It drives them to things -- because they know they couldn't actually fight the American army and defeat it. It drives them to strategies of trying to erode our national will to fight the war, because if we fight it, we're going to win it. In regard to the threat from China: China is rising. And we're smart to hedge against a rising China. But I would encourage you to remember that one of the most important strategic variables, one of the most important advantages you can have, is time. And we actually have a lot of time to figure out how to deal with a rising China. And our -- the American military is one of many means for managing that rise and one in which we have a strong advantage. A second thing I'd like to ask you to consider is -- I agree with Tom about the value proposition. The American military is extraordinarily good at what it does. That does not mean that the money that we spend on our defense we spend well. Right? The Defense Department, in truth, actually doesn't know if we have enough money to spend on American defense, because they actually cannot pass an audit that every American business has to pass. They already told Congress they won't be able to pass an audit until 2017. Given that the budget has doubled in the last 10 years, and DOD cannot account for the money, that suggests to me that there are reasonable places in the budget from which we could wring greater effectiveness in our spending. The American military is terrific at the effectiveness of war-fighting. We're not cost effective. We're not particularly efficient at how we do it. And I would offer you the testimony of General Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that if we forced ourselves to think, we could probably do this with less resources. He also said that because budgets have essentially been unconstrained for the last 10 years, the American military has gotten into a lot of bad habits. As Admiral Mullen, General Dempsey's predecessor, said, we have raised a generation of military leaders who don't know how to budget because they've never had to do it. Let me just point out to you some of the cost-drivers or how expensive American defense is. GAO determined the last year that we wasted $74 billion in the year 2012 because of the procurement process, because of what Senator McCain has described as the political -- as the military industrial Congressional complex. The Pentagon's determined we have 20 percent more bases and facilities than we need and Congress will not permit them to close them. The military -- the Pentagon has tried to ramp down the expansion of the personnel account -- military raises, housing, funding, pensions -- and Congress won't do it. So even the Pentagon understands the resources to be saved here. In fact, the position that we are in is that we have the world's finest military and that all-volunteer force is becoming unaffordable. We have to better constrain the costs of our defense. And even within national security, there are things that need money even more than the American military, right? If you look at why were are not more decisively winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the wars we have fought in the last 10 years, the reason is we're underfunding diplomacy, development, other things we need to spend our money on.

And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, in partnership with the McCain Institute for International Leadership, where our motion is, Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. We have two teams of two arguing over this motion. And now, we move on to Round 2. Two teams of two arguing this motion: Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. The team arguing for the motion, Andrew Krepinevich and Tom Donnelly have argued that budget cuts threatened -- threaten to make a dangerous world even more dangerous, that a weaker U.S. military would encourage our adversaries and create for us a hollow military. They say that the peace and security that comes in 3 cents of the dollar is a bargain considering what a peaceful world it has led to for so long in terms of wars among the great powers; that this is a dangerous world, and we have to take our enemies seriously, in their perception of this, as a weakness on our part. The team arguing against the motion, Kori Schake and Ben Friedman, say that the threat at this point is exaggerated. Number one, we are so dominant militarily, we have oceans protecting us, a technological advantage, and a dominance that makes it just too early to worry about a real threat to our existence. They say that the -- that their opponents are actually arguing for a global domination that is unnecessary to ensure the common defense. And they also point out that the cost of the military itself actually represents the real threat to our national security.

The United States is incredibly safe from natural geographic reasons because of our economy. And most of what we're doing in the name of safety or defense is sort of a luxury that most states don't endeavor to do. And I think it gets us into trouble that we could avoid. You know, a few difference of percentage points in the defense budget is not going to make a difference. But if we really rethought our strategy, we could be a lot safer because we'd avoid conflicts that we get into.

In the article, even absent the sequestration cuts, I said we're going to have to really trim our sails. We're not going to be able to fight or deal with threats in two different regions, even though there are three regions in the world we consider to be vital interests. We're not -- maybe -- I think this is a good thing. We're not going to be able to threaten anybody with regime change. I think we're going to struggle just to maintain access to critical regions where we have trading partners and resource requirements. We haven't figured out a way to deter cyber attacks. And the cyber threat is growing. We haven't figured out a way to protect our assets in space. And I think the next big thing coming down the road is the undersea infrastructure which is huge. And with the spread of robotics, increasingly accessible even to non-state groups who can threaten the enormous energy infrastructure that in military parlance is comprised mostly of soft targets.

I was talking to one -- in fact Secretary Panetta -- and if you dont already know, he's very fond of colorful language. And I raised the issue of efficiencies.

The problem is, as I mentioned before, that when you've got a shrinking budget and exploding personnel costs, what gets squeezed out are science and technology, research and development of new capabilities, training and exercise to test out these capabilities to find out what works and what doesn't. And so you're stuck making a big bet, and you hope it'll work, but you really don't have the chance to test it out.

But the point is that, for example, take the army, right? You don't have to make one big bet by cutting the size of the army. The size of the army in the 1990s, before September 11th, was 490,000 soldiers. That was when you still had the planning construct that said we had to be able to fight two nearly simultaneous wars. It was before you had the revolution in communications and precision and battlefield awareness that has made American forces so much more effective than they were. It was before the defense guidance, which secretary Panetta brought into being in the Pentagon that said that we are not going to size our force to fight a large, sustained land war anymore. And yet, the size the army says it needs is 490,000, the exact same as in 1990. The threats are different, the requirements are different. We need to find new ways to do stuff. The answer shouldn't be the exact same as it was in the 1990s.

We proved that by being unable to do Iraq and Afghanistan properly at the same time, so I don't think that was a good experience. And I don't want to expect that the world is going to be technologically transformed and that the art of war is going to be fundamentally different than it's ever been in human history. That seemed like a bit of a long shot to me, too. So numbers matter, and we have just proved that in spades over the last decade.

I am not signing up for the Don Rumsfeld vision of anything in my argument. You know, occasionally we might agree on something, but my argument is not his. He liked war a lot more than I do, and the -- we're hearing a lot of assumptions about the changes that will be made if we -- or what will happen if we cut the defense budget -- personnel will get squeezed and we'll cut the O&M budget, so we'll have a hollow force. If we did that, it would be a mistake. The -- so we don't endorse things that will lead to a hollow force. The military of the '70s I'll grant was a bit of a hollow force. The personnel situation was bad, but that's because we didn't pay them enough. We -- compensation is much better now by a mile. And we are making choices now to avoid cutting the O&M budget at the expense of procurement, so we can avoid that. And our argument doesnt entail doing all the bad things you say it does. And finally, I think, since you asked, power -- power is our capacity to generate force. It's potential. It's not standing military forces. There are powerful nations that have quite small militaries. The difference is they could -- with weak nations is they could change that if they wanted to. So our long term economic health, of course, is essential to our power.

The Air Force is cutting back on training, the Army's cutting back on training, the Air Force can't replace its aging aircraft in part because we screwed up over the last decade or so in terms of the procurement approach. But, again, that's poor excuse for compromising our security and punishing our service members. So yeah, were mistakes made? Certainly they were. You know, does that mean we give up on our security because we didn't get it right or is that -- do we ignore what's going on now?

And that wasn't quite as severe as the services made it out to be, but it was dumb, and I'm against it. We're against it. But going forward, what we have is budget caps, and if they get under the cap they can do whatever they want. So we don't have to do all those foolish things with cutting back on training in '14, '15, '16, '17. As long as they get under the cap, they can make choices. So sequestration in '13 was dumb, going forward as long as they get under the cap, it's okay.

It's also some freedom for our allies to not be militarized and to dampen down those ambitions. So what about that whole point of our enemies' perception of us being not dominant? Tom Donnelly.

We see that in the Pacific, in the South China Sea, where the Chinese, even without an aircraft carrier, are nudging and pushing at what Ben calls the various rocks in the South China Sea; the things that really matter to our allies, people who are our treaty allies, like the Filipinos. I don't want there to be a war over a rock in the South China Sea. And what we see is people feeling for how far they can go in the absence of an American military presence.

There are three agents of the world that we rely on for trade and for resources. We're part of the global economy. And we rely on the global common space, cyber space, the sea, and the undersea to link us to those parts of the world. In the Far East, the Chinese, for over a decade now, have been building up their military capabilities to try and push us out of the region. Just listen to what the Japanese, the Taiwanese, the Koreans, and so on are saying. We have a strategic choice. Now, it's not going to be a big army that we respond with. But we're going to have to do something to maintain stability in that region, lest we encourage Chinese adventurism. And you could see it in the paper, in terms of the trends in Chinese behavior. Iran -- a nuclear armed Iran. Do you think they're more or less likely to support Hezbollah, or to support Assad in Syria, or to try and undermine the Gulf monarchies, and disrupt the flow of energy? Pakistan -- and again, you know, I dont want to go on at length. But you look at cyber situation. Concerns that even non-state entities will be able to inflict serious damage on us by cyber attacks.

What Iran does, in terms of disrupting energy flows or funding Hezbollah, is not driven by small differences in U.S. defense budget. They might have some minor preference but it really doesn't matter. They're going to do what they're going to do for other reasons than a margin of difference in our defense spending. If there's been any indication that the United States is not as up for war as it was a while ago, it wasn't because we're spending a little less on the military, it's because we had bad wars that made the public less enthusiastic to go, which is a good thing. And maybe it cuts back on our credibility, but -- -- if you want lots of credibility to have wars, then don't have dumb ones all the time, you know?

The purpose of trying to maintain a stable military balance in the region and address the capabilities that the Chinese are building up -- the purpose is to avoid war, not to fight war. You can get into a war because of the perception that you're too weak to defend yourselves or that you're irresolute. And cutting a trillion dollars additionally out of defense over the next decade certainly, I think, sends that message as we withdraw from parts of the world.

China doesn't want to go to war with us. They probably want to go to war with us even less than we could ever possibly want to go to war with them. They want the benefits of nibbling away, pushing the limits. They want to intimidate the Filipinos and the Taiwanese. They don't want to mess with us. But if we're not there, there are going to be consequences. And you see it every day.

And strength can also be provocative. States balance power. States design, build military capability in response not necessarily to weakness but to being threatened by other states. States' decisions to build nukes and to build armies are often driven by threats, including the ones that the United States poses to their borders. So it's not so simple that our weakness encourages buildups. And I really think we ought to talk more carefully about what scenario would take place absent a larger U.S. commitment to Asia that's so nefarious. I think, yeah, the Philippines and Taiwan and Japan might spend a little more on defense and create a stronger alliance among them. But that's not a bad thing necessarily. We can -- we can live with other states having geopolitical responsibilities.

Chinese are good strategists. Yeah, we have the world's best Air Force. But our aircraft in the Far East are concentrated at two bases. What are the Chinese doing? They're building lots of ballistic missiles to target those bases. We have the world's best carriers, as Kori mentioned, and a lot of them. The Chinese are developing missiles to target those carriers and they're building submarines to go after those carriers. So do we cut the -- you know, do we need a big army for China, to maintain stability in that region? Hardly. But we are going to figure out -- or going to need to figure out a way to maintain stability in that region. Otherwise, I don't think the Filipinos are going to say, You know, the Americans are gone. Let's take on the Chinese. Now, the Japanese may say, The Americans are gone, we need nuclear weapons. And let's see what that does to the neighborhood.

My name is Josh Sax . My question is for the affirmative side. There's clearly waste in the defense budget I think you would agree on. There's stuff in there that is really more of a jobs program than weapons, stuff the army doesn't even want like additional Abrams tanks. Would you think that if we were to reduce spending on those things that it would be better to reallocate that spending to additional military priorities? Or would it be better in our long-term interest to take those reductions and put it towards reducing the national debt?

One thing, look, we need to get sort of the best bang for the buck that we can under any circumstances, whether we're spending more or spending less. On the other hand, compared to other forms of government, I would offer the Pentagon is actually, again, a good value proposition. If the public education system educated my kids as well as the military does its job, both my kids would have gone to Harvard, and they didn't. You know, if my doctor kept me as healthy as the military kept the world, I would live forever. So as a government function for all the waste, fraud, and abuse that there may be in the department -- and I wish it were zero -- it's relatively less. And the dollar amount is really trivial when we're talking about the size of the federal debt or the deficit. Look, we spend as much per year almost -- and if interest rates actually go up to a market rate, more on servicing our current debt than we do on military power. So in the relative size of things, we're not talking about a lot of money. You know, trillions and trillions, and pretty soon you're talking about real money. But compared to the rest of the economy or what the government spends, this is peanuts.

My name is Bernie William. I'm a grad student at Seton Hill University, studying diplomacy. My question is, first, to start off, the Carter Center for Peace has said that since World War II, of the 50 major armed conflicts that have gone on, they've all been about religion or ethnic conflict. And they've all been pretty much within borders. So -- and the actual occurrence of violence has gone down, and the number of people being killed has gone down. So is the threat to the United States that much -- increasing so much when we're using our military to go into these countries, essentially almost as our diplomats, and saying, This is our brand of Americanism, and you have to -- and you have to accept it? Can the military be changed to be more of our diplomatic arm, or could that money be better spent to diplomats, commerce, and improving trade?

And that's because we don't train our diplomats and our development people to the same level of professional expertise that we train our military, and we need to do that. That's actually a better place to spend our money. It matters to see diplomats doing diplomatic work, and we could spend our money that way, we just choose not to.

That correlates really strongly with the rise of American power. So, again, that's what I was talking about originally. This has produced great benefits, not only to us, but to humanity -- -- and there's -- and Kori will remember this from her own time in the White House. The problem with diplomats is that if you want to send them to Afghanistan, at least until recent years, they could say no. They could refuse to go. So we need all the tools in our kit bag of all kinds, but we should not pretend that military power isn't part of what needs to be in that kit bag.

I mean, diplomacy is really hard. We sort of have this idea that because diplomats don't produce magical results in transforming societies that are problems, that we should hand it over to the military, which is really good at destroying things but also doesn't have the tools to build society. So I'm certainly not in favor of transforming the military's mission. The -- what Tom just said ignores a vast social science literature on the causes of the long peace. This idea that peace in the world, this massive decline in violence which you referred to, which is not talked about enough -- everyone should read Steve Pinker's book about this -- civil wars are in massive decline, coups are in massive decline, genocide has been going away. Your chances as a human of being killed in political violence have descended massively since World War II. We don't talk about that in Washington. That's not due to the benevolence of the United States of America, I don't think. It has to do with the spread of liberalism, maybe, the spread of capitalism, and the experience of wars which cause societies to learn. And, again, this isn't just me talking, this is most of the people who study this for a living. This idea that --

So and if you read Pinker's book, he says this progression has been going on much longer, even prior to World War II, which is kind of hard to understand, but it's not a controversial sentiment that violence is massively declining.

I would like to think that diplomacy could solve all our problems, we wouldn't need militaries. Or that the global economy's stupid, if we all just sit down and shut up, we're going to get rich. Fact of the matter is, in the absence of a stabilizing military force, you tend to get into trouble. Look at the period from 1850 to 1914. The end of the Napoleonic wars. Britain emerges as the world's dominant power. And the Pax Britannica exists for a century, until the time that Britain's power began to wane, they began to cut back on their defenses. They began to expand their social welfare programs, for better or worse. And Germany decided that they could win a war quickly, that they could defeat the Allies quickly. And what you ended up with is World War I and carnage on an unparalleled scale. Again, it wasn't because the British were too strong that Germany decided to go to war. It was because they thought they had an opportunity to advance their aims at the expense of others.

So I don't think there are that many lessons in that regard from the private sector; I think we have to learn lessons from the public sector about how to be more efficient.

Again, we have to keep things in perspective, as -- although I would add to that, we're not suffering from what, you know, the historian Paul Kennedy called imperial overstretch. We're suffering from things like entitlement overstretch. The money that we're spending that's impoverishing us is not going, for the most part, to buy military power. It's going to buy other things that the government does, like provide social services. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing or not, I -- you know, people can reasonably disagree. But that's where the money is going. And if we want to reform both the federal government's books and to boost economic productivity, we can't do it by cutting the defense budget. We have to do it in other ways.

The problem isn't necessarily entitlements, per se. It's the fact that as a people we're not willing to pay for the benefits we vote ourselves. Entitlements are up around 10 percent of GDP, not 3 percent. And they -- the slope line is going up dramatically. And as Robert Rubin said not too long ago, if we don't get a handle, particularly on the medical entitlements, then there's no way we can solve our economic problem.

But yet I've seen how China and Russia are stealing our intellectual property and using that to make huge advances in their capabilities. So how can you argue that by cutting the defense budget that we're simply going to be able to maintain our dominance when our enemies are using our technology and our technical development against us?

You're exactly right, the protection of intellectual property is actually probably the most important thing the American government should be negotiating in our trade treaties, because that is the engine of our economy. I live in Silicon Valley, and you can just feel the way that excitement and interaction and people spurring off each others ideas. We build better mouse traps. And so I guess I am less concerned than you are because I'm pretty highly confident that we will continue to be an engine of innovation, of new ideas, and that having them steal the design for the original iPod is a dangerous thing, but it's a lot less dangerous when we go on to the iPod 7.

It's one thing you do to create an outcome that you want. And to argue that constraining one element of why the United States is so dominant and so powerful and such a force for good in the world, that constraining that one element will in fact be a gift to our enemies dramatically understates all the other things that go into America being a dominant power, the innovation that you talked about, the economic strengths that you talked about, the value of our ideas, the extent to which who we are and what we are willing to fight for in the world reshapes other people's sense of the possibilities and their future. There are a lot of reasons the United States is powerful and admired and feared in the world. And defense spending, a small cut on the margin of that, is actually not going to have a major perturbation of effect on it. But in fact, spending is much too crude a measure by which to determine whether or not it -- that the United States is giving gifts to our enemies. It's too small a factor in the overall -- in the overall constellation of who the United States is and why it's powerful and dominant in the international order. And that in order to accept our opponents' proposition, you would have to believe that a small change at the margin of a very large defense budget of a very good military would, in fact, have a major influence on the calculations of America's enemies in the world. And Ben and I are trying to argue there's a more complicated calculation than that. More things go into it, and that we need to think in a broader term. And you can accept many of the very good arguments that Andy and Tom made --

Cutting the Pentagons budget is a gift to our enemies|i2Debates/061913 pentagon budget.p|196|R4|THOMAS DONNELLY|for|2|7|11|2|0|26|0|27|0|0|7|2|55|14|1|4|9|0|0|0|0|181|3|0|1|0|0|6|16|0|1|6|30|0|0|4|6|2|0|2|4|4|8|17|34|38|54|11|29|0|0|3|0|0|13|14|0|4|4|5|48|4|1|2|22|282|Well, thanks to you all for listening to this sometimes unhappy and complex debate. I still think that the basic proposition is pretty simple and straightforward. And I guess that's why I'm not a political scientist and I'm more of a historian because that's the experience that -- and the measures, the outputs by which I would judge this proposition. Kori keeps talking about Americans building a better mouse trap. The world that we have built over the last seven decades is a really good mouse trap. It's a complex mouse trap, as Kori suggested. There are lots of things that go into making a liberal peace. But it's not a liberal peace that invented itself. The Europeans didn't, after five centuries of slaughtering one another and slaughtering the rest of the peoples in the world, decide -- get all together and say, you know, I think we should cut this out. Not even the imperial Japanese. They were defeated in war by the United States, and because of that, they've become liberal democracies and pretty peaceful ones too. So I don't know what the marginal difference will be, but it's not an experiment that I want to make. We've seen what's happened with the marginal cuts of the last couple of years. We see what's happening in Syria today. We see the Chinese messing about in the South China Sea. Are they coming to our shores tomorrow? No. But let's not let it come to that point. A marginal difference. We don't want to know where the last margin of safety is. It's better to have more margins of safety than less. And that's really what this proposition comes down to.

I think that was a good move for us to fight that. So let's not say that we oppose that. Look, my argument is -- it has two parts. Number one, we can do a lot -- we can save a lot of money while doing all the things we do in the world. If you think we're agents of history and everything in the world is great because of us, fine. Go listen to some of the recommendations out there on how to cut the defense budget by 50 or 60 billion, and you can do it, okay? You can cut the defense budget and still have these alliances. My own view is these alliances and a lot of stuff we're doing in the world are actually bad for our security, so we'd be even better off if we could get out of the business of trying to run everyone else's security for them. Pax Britannica, Pax Americana, a lot of other things were happening in the world at that time. A lot has changed. There were -- it's a disservice to history to say that there's only one factor that matters, which is whether or not there's a hegemon that's trying to manage international affairs. There's a variety of reasons, changes in the international system that encourage peace, absent the benevolence of the United States of America. So I think what we have today is a luxury budget. It's not a defense budget. It protects our safety in the same way a billionaire's restaurant choices prevent his starvation. There's a lot of room -- there's a lot of room in there for us to be safe and cut. So I think cuts to the Pentagon are a gift to ourselves, will make us a bit richer. And in the long term by inducing some choices that we've avoided in the defense budget, they might make us reconsider some policies that actually erode our security and get us into trouble. And that's why cutting the defense budget is not a gift to our enemies.

Cutting the Pentagons budget is a gift to our enemies|i2Debates/061913 pentagon budget.p|200|R4|ANDREW KREPINEVICH|for|3|13|7|1|0|22|0|32|0|0|3|1|48|17|1|6|9|0|0|0|0|171|2|0|0|0|3|2|19|0|0|2|3|0|0|3|7|1|0|2|23|1|4|29|36|7|33|3|36|0|0|1|0|0|30|20|0|8|2|11|38|18|0|2|16|291|One way to think about your vote is if Vladimir Putin were here tonight or the senior generals of the PLA or the Ayatollah Khomeini, how would they be voting, do you think? The issue we debate here tonight is very real for me. For 25 years I wore the uniform of a soldier, and in the 1973 Middle East war we were one order short of arming nuclear warheads. But we were trained. We were equipped. We were ready. Two years later in 1975 I was stationed on a militarized zone in Korea when the North Koreans were digging tunnels underneath us and trying to intercept the resupply ships we were sending out to some of the islands off the coast of South Korea. But we had confidence in our equipment. We had well-trained troops. We weren't looking forward to a scrape but we were ready. Only two years later, after the results of Watergate and Vietnam and inflation and oil shocks really hit home, I was in a unit where we couldn't train, where our troops were hiding toilet paper because we couldn't get toilet paper for our troops, where some of my best soldiers were leaving the Army because they had no faith that the American people were willing to provide what was necessary for us to be a ready unit. And I say thankfully we were not put to the test. We recovered, but it was a very expensive proposition in the early 1980s to put Humpty Dumpty back together again after the military was broken. We were lucky. I wouldn't want to risk our security or our economic well-being on luck, and certainly not the lives of our young men and women in uniform. Thank you.

Andrew Krepinevich. And that concludes our closing statements, and now it's time to see which side you feel has argued the best. We want to have you go again to the keypad at your seat to register your vote. You voted before the debate, we're going to have you vote again now. And the team that has moved its numbers the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Press one if you are in support of the motion, two if you are against it, three if you are undecided. The motion is, "Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. " It looks like everybody's ready. We're going to have the results -- I'm going to announce the results in about two minutes from now, but first, we regret that Senator McCain has a day job, that he -- we don't regret it, actually we're glad he's doing his day job -- he is there doing it now. He wasn't able to make it, sends his regrets, but we want to bring back to the stage in his place Ambassador Kurt Volker.

So before we get the results of the voting, I just want to raise one question of my own. Was this the best most illuminating discussion of our defense budget cuts that you have heard in this town in a long time? And also is John Donvan the best moderator you've seen do this in -- Now, when we got here there were a lot of the issues that were going to come out. The fact is we are cutting our defense budgets, and the fact is we're going to have to face a lot of choices about what that means and how we manage it. And I think you heard tonight a lot of the things that we're going to be thinking about in the months ahead as we have to work through that process. So I want to thank all of you again for coming this evening and I want to apologize on behalf of Senator McCain that indeed he does have a day job. I was going to say, "Unfortunately, he's stuck working on immigration, but actually I think I feel fortunately he's working on immigration. So thank you all.

And just a couple of announcements. We'd love it if you tweeted about this debate. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, @McCainInstitute, and #Pentagon. Thank you again to the McCain Institute team. We really, really enjoyed partnering with you on this. It was -- it's been a terrific partnership, and I think we both gained out of it. I also want to thank WAMU which carries almost all of our debates and was very involved in letting a lot of you know about this debate and obviously they got through to you because the place is full and we're delighted by that. This was our 75th debate since Bob Rosenkranz brought Intelligence Squared to the United States. And we are happy to be sharing this milestone with everybody here. Our fall season in New York starts in September. Some of the topics that we're going to be looking at include drones, breaking up the big banks, the case for going vegan -- -- that's not a Washington topic. Gun -- -- gun control and immigration. Our tickets go on sale later on this summer. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit our website at www.IQ2US.org, and don't forget to visit the McCain Institute for International Leadership's website, and that is at McCainInstitute.org, for all of their upcoming events. They have a full schedule constantly, things happening here in Washington DC. We wanted to encourage you to take a look at the encyclopedia and look at Dwight Eisenhower, circa 1939. We actually pulled the photograph. We've looked at it. But I don't want to put it up on the screen without your permission. Go ahead? We have your permission? Switched at birth or what? All right. Thank you for being a good sport. That was great. All right. We've had -- I now have the final results. You have voted twice, once before the debate, and once again afterwards, after hearing all of the arguments. Here is the result. The motion: Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. Before the debate, in polling the live audience, 22 percent of you agreed with the motion, 57 percent were against, and 21 percent were undecided. Those are the first results. Remember now, the team -- after you vote the second time, the team that has changed the most numbers in percentage point terms is declared our winner. Onto the second vote. Cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies. The team arguing for the motion in the second vote went from 22 percent to 29 percent. They picked up seven percentage points. That is the number to beat: seven percentage points. Now, the team against the motion in first vote was 57 percent. The second vote, 65 percent. That is eight percentage points. It's enough to win, just barely. The team arguing against the motion that cutting the Pentagon's budget is a gift to our enemies has been declared our winner. Congratulations to them. And thank you from me, John Donvan. We'll see you next time.

Thank you. So at "Nightline," we've always said sometimes we work on some stories for months, and then suddenly the day we put it on the air, something breaks that makes it very relevant. And we say, "Well, the news gods have smiled on us today. " It's not in a happy way, but there's a real timing relevance to what we're doing tonight, isn't there?

There's a presidential address this evening, and it concerns obviously Syria, where if there's any action taken at all, probably will involve drones. Drones are in active roles now in Yemen and Somalia. So it is an extremely timely issue.

Some have sent them, and some have been near or close to the receiving end. The side that's arguing in support of drone warfare, actually, in our case, the side arguing against the motion, the side that is enforcing it and standing up for drone warfare, what arguments do they have going for them?

It has killed a lot of terrorists. And it does it in a very precise way because these unmanned aerial vehicles can provide surveillance for many, many hours, days, coordinate with other forms of intelligent cell phone intercepts and really identify targets to a degree of precision that no other weapon system can do. So it's very accurate. It minimizes collateral damage to civilians, does not eliminate it. And, of course, it keeps the U.S. operators many, many thousands of miles out of harm's way.

These are not soldiers on a battlefield. These are individuals on a kill list. They're targeted. They feel like assassinations. And it raises questions about the morality, about the legality, who is it that approves these targets, how are they vetted, how precise is that process? What are the legal safeguards around it? And particularly when the administration reserves the right to kill American citizens abroad with this program, it just shows how difficult and problematic the legal environment is around these issues.

Also, as I mentioned, because we are a radio broadcast, there will be a few points in the evening when I want to encourage spontaneous applause. Laugh when we come back from breaks and things like that. I think you kind of caught it. If I give you one of these - - yeah, you all got it. I'm getting nods. Well, done without any training whatsoever. And I also, at this point, want to just ask for one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz who really made this all possible. The U.S. Air Force -- it's the agency that makes pilots. And in one recent 12-month period, it made 250 of them trained up to fly bombers and fighter jets. But that is versus the 350 who were trained during the same period to fly drones by remote control, never leaving the ground themselves. 350 drone pilots versus 250 traditional, clearly a trend that has good reasons behind it as the U.S. and especially the CIA sends these riderless aircraft week after week after al-Qaeda. But there's also a backlash against the drones and worries that the way we're using these weapons could come back to bite us. Well, this sounds like the makings of a debate. So let's have it. Yes or no to this statement: The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed, a debate from John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will argue for and against this motion: The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. As always, our debate will go in three rounds. And then the live audience votes to choose the winner.

Our motion is "the U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " And let's meet the team arguing for this motion, but first welcome, ladies and gentlemen, Ahmed Rashid. And, Ahmed, you are a journalist, you're a bestselling author. In your youth straight out of Cambridge you moved to Baluchistan in Pakistan and became a guerrilla fighter and a political organizer for 10 years. You came home with fewer teeth and a case of malaria. You then became a journalist and before September 11 you spent some time with the Taliban and wrote a book called "Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia. " It was a book that everybody wanted to read after September 11. According to the New York Times, when you wrote this book you, quote, "wore out welcome with the Taliban," meaning that it wasn't exactly a fluff piece.

Ladies and gentlemen, John Kael Weston. Kael, you are also arguing that "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " You had a very interesting and unorthodox career in the State Department. You were there for 10 years. Seven of those years you were in Iraq and Afghanistan but you were not on a red carpet inside an embassy, you were in the dust with U.S. Marines. You were out there in the field more than any other State Department officer. Newsweek, Kael, called you a "renegade diplomat" in part because of this style in the field but also because you had some issues in dealing with authority. So this debate, you're up against a general and an admiral, both four stars. Are you a little intimidated by that?

" If they're feeling bad about that, they just need to Google what General Jack Rippersaid in response, which is even a better quote. So, thank you.

Norton Schwartz, you're also taking this position against our motion. The motion is "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " You're arguing against it. You have only recently retired as the U.S. Air Force's top officer. You were chief of staff in 2012 after 39 years of service. You got interested in flying as a kid. You graduated from the Air Force Academy. As a command pilot, you have more than 4,400 hours under your belt. And it was under your leadership that actually the Air Force retooled significantly in the direction of drone aircraft remotely piloted aircraft. And I just want to know have you actually piloted one of the -- one of those riderless planes?

Ladies and gentlemen, Norton Schwartz, General Norton Schwartz. So as we said at the beginning, this is a debate. It's a contest. And in this contest only one side wins. And we have you, our live audience, make that choice. By the time the debate is over, we will have asked you to vote twice -- once before and once again after you've heard the arguments. And the way we decide victory here -- the team who has changed your percentage point -- your vote by the most percentage points will be declared our winner. So, let's go now to do the preliminary vote. You go to those keypads that are at your seat. And it's on the right hand -- right arm of your seat. You look at the motion -- I want to be careful, but there's kind of a negative built into this motion. The U.S. Drone Program is Fatally Flawed. This is the team that's taking that position. They're for that motion. If you agree with them at this point, push #1. If you take the opposite side -- which means that you're with this team, push #2. And if you're undecided, which is perfectly reasonable, push #3. And we'll lock the votes in a couple of seconds. If you pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself and the system will record your last vote. And you can ignore all of the other keys. And then you stick around to the end to the debate. We have you vote immediately.

First to speak -- John Kael Weston. He is a former State Department officer. He spent seven years in Iraq and Afghanistan as an advisor to U.S. Marine Combat Units. He is now a regular contributor to the Daily Beast. He's writing a book, due to be published in 2014. Ladies and gentlemen, John Kael Weston.

And I want to say, it's great to be back in New York City. I was a resident here for four years, and I think it's one of the two most scrappy and resilient places in America. I won't say what the other one is, but you can probably guess. I also have to say that although our topic tonight is drones, I think in the back of our mind, we know that our nation is having a very important debate about Syria. And I just want to say I'm grateful that we the people are leading our government on that issue, and at least we're pausing for a while, perhaps, before a decision is made. The issue at hand is the motion that Ahmed and I are going to spend seven minutes each -- as well as the rest of the evening, of course -- we believe strongly that the program is fatally flawed. Ahmed will cover some of the issues that I won't. We've divided the labor as follows: he's going to look at lot of the legality questions. He'll look at -- from his perspective in Pakistan and all the great books he's written -- how much recruiting has actually increased. And contrary to, I think, some of the conventional wisdom, how effective and how targeted some of these drone strikes are. My points are going to be based on having lived in interesting places like Fallujah, Khost, Helmand . I view my role tonight as being the ambassador for the people that don't get a voice on this debate, which are really the Afghans and the Pakistanis -- most of the people I sat across a table from and heard the stories after the drones launched the hellfire missiles. So, if I do that well enough, hopefully you'll get some of their voices, which is what motivated me mostly in this debate, is to not speak as a former State Department official, but to actually speak for the people. So, it's not a headquarters perspective. It's not a State Department official perspective. It's their perspective. One thing left out of my bio was that my mother is a fifth-grade schoolteacher, so if you'll bear with me, I'm going to ask you to do a couple things she taught me. I've got about 30 seconds to ask you for this, so, the first is show and tell, and the second is a pop quiz. I'm going to start with the show and tell because -- I think it reinforces, again, what's lost in the drone debate too often. This is a pakol, which is a wool cap that basically, the more rural parts of Afghanistan, you'll see the tribal people wearing. Again, I'm trying to give voice to these guys, some of my friends.

This sparkly cap is called a kandahari, which is what I consider the next generation of leaders that you'll see wearing a lot. And again, if we're listening to them, what they tell us is basically that the drone program is undercutting them and undercutting their future. And then finally -- and I'll be quick -- I think I'm speaking on behalf of the front-line troops, because contrary, again, to conventional wisdom, this Kevlar helmet -- which is a Marine helmet -- I think represents those of us who dodge more IEDs and dodge more bombs when these drone strikes actually don't hit their target. Okay. The quiz. If you could pull out a piece of paper, my mom will be proud. Or if you can take some mental notes -- I'm going to ask you two questions, and I think they're important questions, and they're relevant. The first is, after 12 years of constant warfare, which really started in the scarred city of New York with Lower Manhattan, what words or adjectives do you think Afghans or Iraqis or Yemenis associate with the United States of America? Nouns, adjectives, whatever comes to mind. And then secondly, what words would you associate with our nation, the United States of America, after 12 years of basically constant warfare? Second question is, why is May 1, 2010, relevant to this debate? Don't Google it. Don't use your iPhones. But if you happen to -- if that rings a bell with you, we'll come back to it. The two case studies I'm now going to focus on in about the -- half of the time I've got left are one from Iraq, Fallujah, and a couple basically from Afghanistan. In 2004, drones were not armed. They were eyes in the sky. When drones became a fatally flawed program is really the X that I'm trying to hit here. The Fallujans would look up, they'd hear a flying lawnmower. The women would hang their clothes and get awkward and uncomfortable. The city leaders would come into our meetings and be irritated, but they weren't yet strategically against us. And, of course, this is the site of the largest battle of the Iraq war. When did they become fatally flawed, and who did they become fatal to? I will argue, and Ahmed will argue as well they became fatal to civilians, more than a few. And they became fatal, I believe, to all of us. In Afghanistan, in early 2009, marine general Larry Nicholson and I were in a place called Tagaz, which is basically the southern reaches of our area of operation. We met a bunch of Marines who were alone and unafraid at the edge of the American military empire, overstretched. We all know the story. The next day, in the same location, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killed two marines and killed a corpsman. If anyone wanted revenge, I did. If anyone wanted revenge, General Larry Nicholson did. If anyone wanted revenge, the United States Marine Corps did. Within a few days, we identified some suspicious looking guys who were near the area from above. Two drone strikes landed a couple hellfire missiles. One of the men was killed right away. The other one was split in two. And we all watched as he tried to drag himself into the hole from the first strike. He couldn't hide. He bled out. He died. Was it a good guy? Absolutely not. But was he found out to be directly tied to the attack? No. That happens more than we'd like to admit. The next example is based on a New York Times article that just came out on Sunday. You may have read it, but I wanted to be as topical and as recent as I could. Reportedly 14 Afghans were killed. So I asked a friend of mine, who lives in Kunar, what he was hearing. And he quoted a villager who said this: "May Allah give me power for one day to use a single drone on the American people so that the American politicians understand how much it pains when a missile comes from the sky and kills your relatives in front of your eyes, and you can't revenge them any more. " I've got another quote, but I don't have time to get there. In closing, I found a very convincing op-ed by a very senior former member of our government, highly experienced, wrote it brilliantly, brilliant perspective. And it was titled, "Drones alone are not the answer. And it was a New York Times op-ed that came out on August 14th, 2011. He said, "the important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce al-Qaeda's capabilities. They will not. And I am pleased that he is on stage with us. It's Admiral Blair. And I look forward to hearing more comments based on the argument he made in the New York Times. So I'm out of time, but thank you.

On behalf of Admiral Blair, it's a privilege to be here to address with you a very, very important topic. And, Kael, I would argue that I'm representing the troops in the field tonight. And we can talk about the relative advantages. But I think it's important also to address the issue Kael mentioned of the strike on Sunday. It's important to know that that strike killed the individual who publicly admitted to kidnapping Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of the United States Army who was still the only American service person who is incarcerated in Afghanistan today. Now, it may be that others were also injured and/or killed in this event. But I would argue that Afghanistan is a declared combat zone, ladies and gentlemen. And under the rules of armed conflict, that this individual was a legitimate target and clearly a combatant. And he will kidnap no more American servicemen. But let me go back to a bit more balanced discussion. What I want to do tonight -- and I submit, ladies and gentlemen, that the employment of U.S. strike-capable systems is a viable and a rational response to a vexing battlefield problem, one that must be calibrated, used with care, synced withpolicy. But nonetheless, one that allows us to pursue our objectives in a fashion that minimizes loss of life for friendly forces and maximizes the opportunity to avoid needless casualties of friendlies; in other words, collateral damage. Simply remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, permit more considered and more accurate and, as a result, more proportionate application of lethal force than any other comparable weapon system. Because they can spend longer time over the target than equivalent manned aircraft, they give their operators the time to maximize the certainty but not necessarily achieve absolute certainty that they are engaging the right enemy combatants and that they have the time and the means to confirm the presence of noncombatants in the presence of the intended target. Thoughtful observers like our partners tonight have mentioned a number of criticisms. Let me talk quickly about a couple of them. One is that the absence of physical risk to the operator encourages our political leadership to use remote systems more often than they would if they had to put American troops in harm's way. I would counter by asking whether those who use this argument would prefer for the American military to absorb casualties just for the purpose of making war less numbing to the political leadership. In addition -- that's a tactical level -- is the ability of remote systems to maintain surveillance of target areas with remote operators carefully and deliberately evaluating potential targets against the criteria that allows them to shoot, that makes this system so discriminating and effective. Soldiers and airmen under fire on the ground I think you would agree, Kael, are far more likely to shoot back at the sources of fire aimed against them, with greater danger to noncombatants than are remote operators whose safety and lives are not at immediate risk. There's also a concern that nonstate or state actors will use these technologies against us in a more crude and indiscriminate fashion than do we. And well, they might. But the reality is is that this technology is proliferating, and not because we chose to use it. It is a fact of technology advancing. And our lead was and remains significant. So, let me go to a quick summary of some data. This goes back to 2011 in Afghanistan during the surge period. There are about 150,000 Air Force flights in Afghanistan in 2011. Sadly, about 3,000 of those flights were medical evacuation sorties of our wounded, and our dead. Compare that total to 25,000 close air support sorties and support of ground forces, your Marines, of which 1,400 had at least one weapon release. So what this means is, is out of 25,000 sorties, 1,400 actually released a weapon. There were many sorties that flew with no weapon release at all. That's what a professional Air Force does. Ready, finger on the trigger, but extremely careful and deliberate about applying lethal force in practice and in principle. 333 of those 400 weapon releases were by remote systems. Now, I ask you, were those releases -- the three quarters of the releases -- from manned aircraft somehow more practical, less immoral, less unfair than those 25 percent that were released by unmanned aircraft? I think not.

Our motion is "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed," and here to speak in support of the motion, in other words, he feels the program is fatally flawed, Ahmed Rashid. He is a Pakistani journalist based in Lahore and the bestselling author of several books, including "Taliban and Pakistan on the Brink. " Ladies and gentlemen, Ahmed Rashid.
The US drone program is fatally flawed|i2Debates/091013 drones.p|36|R2|AHMED RASHID|for|1|54|16|7|0|81|0|122|0|0|31|14|186|79|0|17|41|0|1|4|0|640|5|0|0|0|0|0|39|0|0|20|84|3|1|16|12|8|0|7|27|6|7|29|117|130|123|32|119|0|1|5|0|0|44|70|0|38|11|20|183|8|3|6|57|1083|The first thing I think to make clear is that unfortunately drones -- which is -- it's a weapon, it's a tool, it's a tactic -- has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is how foreign governments and countries where drones are being used see it. All the good of U.S. foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, et cetera, all are demolished when at the same time the U.S. uses drones. So in fact drones are undermining U.S. foreign policy. They become the only symbol of foreign policy which people abroad remember when they are -- when those countries in particular are targeted. And some of the countries like Yemen, like Pakistan are in fact allies of the United States and drones are being used against allies, naturally that is infuriating the population even more. Secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the much more sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the U.S. in the last few years, where the whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive, development, et cetera. Again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy being undermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, and they do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda. The other question which I think has to be agitating the minds of many Americans is how legal is this? How legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not at war, with which nothing has been disclosed, there's no transparency involved, nobody is informed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again, taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the U.S. The lack of transparency is not helped by the fact that the CIA has been mostly involved in using drones, especially in Pakistan. If -- and certainly there's a move now to move some of these drone attacks to the defense department, but -- and that could increase transparency, but at the moment the CIA's running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosen or whether killing these individuals are justified or not. Now, what all this is leading to is an enormous buildup of hatred for the United States, and that is not just affecting people in the target countries but people all over the Muslim world in particular. It's quite shocking to see the figures in Pakistan. One poll puts 74 percent of Pakistanis now hate the U.S. more than India, and remember, Pakistan has fought three wars against India, and India is the proverbial enemy. Another poll that I just read recently in Chicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent. And here, as I sit, we're talking about a so- called ally of the United States. Now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set. What happens when another country will start using drones? First of all, what happens if a European country, or Russia, or a so-called ally of the United States uses drones? What is the U.S. strategy going to be? How is that going to affect U.S. foreign policy? Are you going to slap that country down? Are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, "No, only we have the right to kill people in other countries. You don't have that right. " Even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the United States uses drones? What happens if North Korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill South Koreans? What happens if Al-Qaeda itself develops drones? What happens if any -- if the Syrians or any of the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones? So, what will be the U.S. policy then? Are you going to go and bomb those countries? What is the U.S. strategy policy going to be? There's a complete vacuum here. There's no thought being given to this. But this could happen tomorrow. Drones now are everywhere. Drones are being used for all sorts of other, peaceful projects. And any of those drones can be bought on the market and they could be converted into drones that kill people. And I think that the idea that somehow, the U.S. is going to have a monopoly over this instrument forever is very short-sighted. I think the other thing that is -- that I must answer, the issue of civilian casualties. There is, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signature strikes. That is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in a group of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, drones are used -- can be used to kill that militant. But of course, they kill everyone else in the truck, too. Women, children, men, civilians. Now, the last drone strike, actually, on Sunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilians were killed. And President Karzai just complained to the Americans. And they were killed by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of these people. I think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that. So, the fact is -- I mean, the issue of civilian casualties is very controversial. The Americans do not tell us what -- you know, how many civilians have been killed. But estimates from other groups put the casualties in Pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000. I mean, that's the level of inaccuracy that we have, because we really don't know. These areas are inaccessible or -- and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, the drone firer, that kind of information is available. And lastly, I think we have to understand how drones have been a recruiting poster for Al-Qaeda and global jihad. Even local groups -- local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with Al- Qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad -- if they have been droned, they become global jihadists. They want to strike back at America. They want to kill Americans. And that is really what is very dangerous, that more and more groups who are really fighting local wars and conflicts are becoming militarized and wanting to strike back at the United States and those other countries.

Thank you very much. And here's where we are. We are in the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate, where our motion is: The U.S. Drone Program is Fatally Flawed. You have heard three of the opening statements, and now on to the fourth. Let's welcome to the lectern Adm. Dennis Blair. Dennis Blair -- -- served as director of National Intelligence and during his 34-year Navy career, served as commander in chief, U.S. Pacific Command. Ladies and gentlemen, Adm. Dennis Blair.

Schwartz addressed the use of drones in a battlefield area with U.S. troops deployed. I'm going to talk about the more controversial program, in which we use drones in areas in which we do not have our troops in action. And Pakistan, of course, is the primary example that comes to mind. In fact, probably our motion tonight, "U.S. drone program is fatally flawed," is shorthand for "the American drones in Pakistan have been a failure. " And you've heard from Mr. Rashid some of the objections to that. I would tell you that there in fact is no independent drone program. The drones are part of a wider strategy which is dedicated to ending the threat from al-Qaeda, a threat with which this city is very, very familiar. The policy of the drones, a tactic to an end, are to take care of the hard core leaders and fighters who are not persuadable, who are not going to change their demonstrated and committed intention to kill as many Americans as they can before they -- before they can accomplish that. The -- a conflict between a country, the United States, and a non- state group like al-Qaeda, is allowed under international humanitarian law. And that's what we are involved in. It began here almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago tomorrow. It has continued with al-Qaeda's affiliates. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sent a bomber to try to kill a bunch of Americans in an airplane over Detroit. TTP, Tehrik-i- Taliban in Pakistan, sent Faisal Shahzad a few blocks south of here to Times Square to kill a bunch of innocent Americans if he could. We are at war with this group. And the leadership of these organizations holed up in places like northwest Pakistan and Yemen, places where the governments of our allies, as Mr. Rashid said, do not control their territory. It's worse in Pakistan. They not only do not control their territory. They give permission to the United States to take action where they cannot, and then they blame us for doing it, which accounts for a great deal of the sentiment in Pakistan when a dissembling hypocritical policy of Pakistani politicians allows them to blame us for actions which they themselves permit. But they could stop us from doing it any time. And the government in Yemen, by way of contrast, openly cooperates with us and tells its people that it does. Now, the drones have been successful. We have killed most of the people who planned, who directed, and then who gloated over the felling of the Twin Towers, the attack on the Pentagon and the aborted attack that ended in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. And we have done that not only with drones, but by armed raids, as we saw in Pakistan, by a lot of cooperation with other countries and a lot of hard intelligence. So drones have played a key role in a successful, but I would argue first phase, of our overall campaign against al-Qaeda. But what about the next phase? I think the role of drones in the next phase should be much different, not because the program has been a failure, but because the situation has changed, and the drones and other tactics have been successes. Now the job is to reduce al-Qaeda from a small-scale threat, which is where it now is, to a nuisance. And to do that, we have to undercut support for al-Qaeda. We have to make sure that Muslim mothers and fathers don't think it's a good idea to send their sons and daughters to strap on suicide vests and to kill innocent people around the world. Al-Qaeda is doing a wonderful job against itself. It has killed far more Pakistanis, far more Muslims than it has Americans and Europeans. But we need to help it further along. And we must do that by becoming even more selective, even more discriminating, even more careful in our use of weapons like drones in the future. And the great bulk of our efforts must be dedicated to helping countries like Pakistan, like Yemen, like Mali, like the southern Philippines, like Somalia, like Libya, like Afghanistan, to make their lives better for their people so that they do not support those who attack the United States and their own governments and others. And this means that we need to continue to work with them. We need to train their security forces to do their jobs to provide security, to do it humanely, respecting the rights of the people. More than that, we need to help them provide economic opportunity, security, dignity, in the words of the Arab Spring. There will be a role for drones in that next phase of this -- of this long-term combat against al-Qaeda. But it will be a more limited, more discriminating role. And the policy in the past certainly has not been a failure, and it must adapt to be a success in the future. And it's only through a campaign like this, ladies and gentlemen, that I believe that we can turn al-Qaeda into just one more in a long line of terrorist groups that flared up, guttered, and then died, which is where it belongs. Thank you.

And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is "the U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " Now we move on to Round 2. And Round 2 is where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and me -- and from me as well. We have two teams of two arguing against this motion. The team arguing for the motion that the program is fatally drawed -- Ahmed Rashid and John Kael Weston, the journalist and the diplomat. We've heard them argue that drones give a bad name to the United States, that they have become a negative symbol to many people in the world who live under doctor underneath them. That they are killing civilians as much as they're killing al-Qaeda; that signature strikes are taking out civilians and that they're a factor that is building up hatred against the United States and working as a recruiting poster for al-Qaeda.

I want to go to the team that's arguing against the motion, which means that you do not think the program is flawed, and quote back to you something that one of your opponents, Ahmed Rashid said, in which he said -- and I'm pretty close to verbatim here. He said that the drones take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda. And I don't know, Ahmed, how literally you meant that. But I want to put the question to this side. In terms of this proportion of civilian casualties to desired targets, what do we know about that? Norton Schwartz.

And it's -- it estimates that civilian casualties versus legitimate combatants in the Afghan theater is about one to seven; in other words, one civilian casualty to seven legitimate combatant casualties. In Yemen, the numbers are somewhat different, about one civilian casualty to five. Now, you can question whether Long War Journal's analysis is accurate. It's consistent with some of the UN reporting as well. I would argue again that any loss of life, any civilian loss of life, is not what uniform personal strive for. They strive to avoid that outcome.

Ahmed, I was quoting you as saying that the civilian loss is just as much as the -- the death of al-Qaeda targets. I don't know if you meant it 50/50, if that's what your point was.

I mean, but certainly there's enough evidence in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan that civilians have died in considerable numbers. Now, that's probably getting less and less as drones become more and more accurate. But as long as things like what I described, the signature strikes continue, where it is justified for a controller to drop a bomb on a group of people in which some of them may be militants and others not, obviously, you are going to get civilian casualties. And as the admiral said this is a war zone. And, in a war zone, you're going to get civilian casualties. The fact of the matter is that this is really undermining and destroying everything else that the U.S. is trying to do in these countries.

But just back to Dennis Blair on this notion of the accuracy of these weapons. Your team is arguing that, in fact, because they can hover over an area for so many hours, because -- maybe you're even saying because there's not a pilot with his heart beating and racing and being shot at, that there's a more rational and sober process happening at the pilot end of this, and that that makes them safer and more accurate. Is there something--I'm trying to get at, is there something in the nature of the weapon itself that -- that resulted in accuracy that's being produced on the battlefield? Because your opponents are saying that they're sloppy.

And when one compares the accuracy and the killing and wounding of bystanders from drones compared to, for example, artillery which is another means of close air support from a manned aircraft. Then it has fewer innocent casualties. That doesn't mean it's zero, and everyone as General Schwartz said is to be greatly regretted, but it is a -- I can tell you, your regrets are fewer if you're operating drones than if you're shooting artillery or having manned aircraft being called in.

The other side is making a compelling argument that in fact the number of casualties is going to be lower than if somebody were dropping a bomb, firing an artillery shell, or even putting boots on the ground, that the proportion is lower.

What basically I think we're losing focus of is what kind of reaction are you getting in village, after village, after village, and how many more enemies and how many more targets are you creating even if one Afghan or one Pakistani is killed.

You know, we tell ourselves often what we want to hear, and that gets translated into memos in Washington, but the Afghan and Pakistani stories that I have heard is that it's -- whether it's one to seven or one to five, it's a lot more than any of us would like to admit to each other. So I don't want to argue numbers. I think it's a strategic equals sign at the end of the ratio that is the real problem.

In the last two years, we have given $200 million in assistance -- $600 million in assistance to Yemen. Of that, virtually two-thirds has been economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, and governance assistance. Roughly one-third has gone to security assistance. That is, to Yemen. And so, we do have a broad-based program in places like Yemen. We are trying to work on places. The media impression, however, is fascinated with the drones. They're sexy. They're sinister. They're so on. So, I'm sorry, but the reality is that it is a broad-based program of which drones are a part and used very selectively. And the people who look carefully can understand that. The people who just want to read the first headline and say, "That's all of American policy" are going to stop there.

The law students at Khost University used to ask me, "What is your case for drones? " Just like Guantanamo, just like the language of these wars that we're in. They are very, very big on how we're doing our wars. So, if we lose that narrative to Al-Qaeda, I think that ratio is actually the equals sign.

Your opponents have made the point, repeatedly, particularly in their opening statements, that the drones have killed a lot of guys that they were supposed to kill, that they have decimated al- Qaeda; and that al-Qaeda is on the way to becoming a footnote in history because of it, which was the whole purpose. These are the guys who blew up buildings in this city. Do you dispute their effectiveness in -- on that agenda?

Obviously, this is a military weapon that has been developed to do a certain thing. And it is going to be further developed, and it's going to be used even more. I think the point is that it is being -- it is being used very indiscriminately and without any kind of scrutiny or self-knowledge even amongst Americans. The whole issue of legality, the whole issue of the precedent that it sets for other countries to follow, there are a whole range of political issues and political answers that are needed in order for this weapon to be really legal, be legitimate and be justified. And that is the point. I don't dispute at all that certainly many senior members of al-Qaeda have been killed. But this is a weapon that has opened up a Pandora's box of questions, especially for those countries who are in receipt of this weapon, you know, at the receiving end. And I think we need -- we need answers. I think this question of precedent is absolutely paramount at the moment with what -- if Syria is using --

We know how to take new weapon systems, use them for mission purposes, control them so that they're done legally, with lawyers in the command loop to a much greater extent than they are for most any other weapons, and you use them for your purpose, and you try to minimize the harmful side effects of which there are many, as there are for any weapon systems in order to get the mission done.

And I'm going to read a quote. When that incident happened that the New York Times covered, a friend of mine went to a tribal elder, and this is what the tribal elder said. Siraj Haqqani, the senior most leader of the Haqqani said that since the USA is using drones against people, the people will use Patriot missiles against the U.S.A. Someone in the village asked what he meant, where are the Patriot missiles? Siraj replied, Suicide bombers are our Patriot missiles. " The question I don't think we still had answered, for example, on the legality question -- and I know we're not in a law seminar, but it's an important one because it's what motivates terrorists to hurt us. Because at the end of the day, I think everyone in this room needs to ask fundamental question, which is, are you and your family safer because of the drone program as it's currently structured, or not? What is the legality of the third wave of drone strikes in terms of the triple tap? What is the legality of that? What are the lawyers in Washington arguing? They're not the initial targets. There's not intel tied to them.

The bottom line was, now, that was a manned strike. And hopefully, I make no apologize for that either. But the bottom line is that we have a situation where you have people that depart a site that -- that had combatants, that was identified as a location. And they depart that area, and you reengage. This is what happens when people leave a foxhole or when people depart a tank in a tank battle. The bottom line, Kael, I think is that you argue for discretion. I believe in that too. But on the battlefield, the principle is to engage the enemy. It is that.

And I finally told the generals in Baghdad -- at that point, I was young enough that I was still a military-aged male according to our definition. We then switched that definition because we started to treat every Iraqi as a potential threat. And I'll be honest with you, if you're a Taliban member, and you're living in a community around family and friends, with all due respect, I don't think that that makes you a legitimate target.

And -- and as I said, this is why this weapon -- the chances of this weapon getting out of hand, getting into the wrong hands and being used indiscriminately in many other parts of the world is -- you know, we should take the example of what the reaction already we are seeing in Pakistan, Yemen and other places.

And so, yes, there's going to be blowback. It's a good question. It's a very legitimate question. The drones are being used in Pakistan, northwest province basically, outside , which is a very different arena than in the conventional side, on the Afghan side of the border. Bottom line is, though is it's what the rules -- the lack of the rules actually, I believe, in our drone program that is the biggest problem. There is not, for example, a marine general necessarily that technically can command where those drones go because they're operated in a different chain of command. And we don't need to get too technical, and that may be changing. But, yes, Afghans are going to respond to a cluster bomb going off or an RPG being launched in the wrong direction. But I have faith that our forces, if one thing over 12 years have learned, is they've learned quite a bit of restraint. And then the rules of engagement have gotten a lot tighter.

It's a judgment. If there were a wonder weapon that would only kill al- Qaeda, dedicated card carrying members, would touch no one else, could be deployed from this room by pressing this button, I'd be all for it. We'd use it. We'd invent it first, and then we'd use it. It doesn't. We have a set of imperfect tools that we use to try to deal with this group of people who has declared war on us and who is far less discriminate, more ruthless, more killing in their approach than we are. And you have to make a call as to just how hard you use that weapon because it kills other people and it causes other effects which our opponents have ably said. I think that judgment has to be made to continually reevaluate it as you go, and I'm sure that there have been times in the past in which we have erred on the side of using it too much. I think we learned from those, and as the president has said in his opening statements, or his statements, in recent weeks, we've decided to cut it down so I think it's a judgment, and I think we're making it in the right direction.

But I also think that U.S. policy has -- there's been enormous tension between the U.S. and Pakistan over the years, as there has been between Yemen and the U.S. Now, it's not all centered around drones, but it's centered around, frankly, a lack of long-term strategy and vision by both countries. And both are to blame. Now, I think what we need is much greater diplomacy and, you know, diplomatic efforts to strike better relationships. We had a situation where -- as you know --

The decision on what is a target can be struck either by a military or by an intelligence CIA drone is made under criteria that are approved by the White House, that are then promulgated. And a series of officials, including lawyers, officials in each of those agencies and the chains of command, then apply them to actual names of Al-Qaeda and other combatants. Once they satisfy that criteria, then they are a legitimate target at that point. The question is, can you truly tell -- is that a person that you found and can strike, and is there a relatively small level of collateral damage? That is, innocent people around that person before you make the strike. That's how it's done.

And then he's tracked back to his house. You don't know his name. You don't know who he is, but he's targeted because it's an association or some other pattern that I'm unfamiliar with. And I want to know, do you put that in a different category? Is that morally more challenging an issue, when you don't actually have a name, but you just have a kind of profile?

Now, signature strikes in a declared combat area are different than those that occur outside declared combat areas. And I -- and the criteria are different. But the bottom line is, if in a combat area, if the individual or individuals appear to be hostile, you can engage them in the context of that signature of hostility. On the other hand, activities in non-combat areas -- and this does apply to Pakistan, I would argue -- it is much more problematic to conduct signature strikes there or elsewhere, where it's not a declared combat zone.

This is up to the middle of 2010. And I think that the administration has been really derelict in not talking about these, because they are based on the self-defense of American and Afghan forces. The signature strikes that were conducted in Pakistan, all of them during my time, and the great majority over all, had to do with armed groups of men who were coming out of known Taliban, TTP areas on road headed towards Afghanistan. And we knew that they were not friendly. They were armed. We know what their arms were. And we knew that they were coming to attack Afghans and Americans and others. And we killed them before they could do that

And I think you're absolutely right. For the admiral to describe the individuals who are involved in this decision making doesn't give us the criteria. I mean, what is the criteria for choosing who's going to live and who's going to die? The fact is the U.S. media itself has portrayed that, the president is sitting there ticking off on a list as to who is going to live and who is going to die, or today, who is going to be drone or not. Now, I mean, we have no idea what the criteria is, how these people are chosen, what is the level of evidence about them being al-Qaeda? Now, I'm not asking for all this to be made public. But I think there must be much -- a much greater degree of satisfaction that people understand, why these targets are being chosen. And that is just not there at all.

I'm talking about the people that I dealt with on the ground. So whether they were in Khost or in Helmund or even in Fallujah, although the drones weren't armed then, I'll let Ahmed take the bigger issue of the Pakistani maybe duplicity. And I'm sure there's a lot of double winks that go on every day of the week over there. But my concern is the allies that actually are the future leaders of Afghanistan, the university students, the Madrasa students, the tribal elders, the Mullahs, the whole host of people that get killed in these drone strikes when they go wrong. Because I don't think the Taliban hold up a red flag. I know they don't, and say, "I'm Taliban. What happens is there's a bad guy in the family or a bad guy in the village, and we identify maybe he's a bad guy, and we drop a hellfire, and then you turn three villages against us. It goes to the ratio and the equal sign. I'll come back to it. Yes to the woman I thought who asked a very good question, elaborated on by you, our moderator, is the number of enemies we're making and the number of targets we're making.

It came up a little bit before. Sometimes in certain circumstances, some weapons seem to raise different moral or ethical challenges to their use. Nuclear weapons, classic example. Your opponents have used the word "sinister" about drones, that they're different somehow. You, I think, alluded to the fact that maybe presidents will be tempted to use drones a great deal more because U.S. casualties are lower, that there's always going to be a temptation for a president. What about this notion that there's a different, perhaps sinister quality to the weapon itself, because it's in a different category?

Seriously, though, I take your point. Based on the available numbers, again, I would go back to that, you can question Long War Journal, you can question the UN studies and -- and so on, the New America Foundation is another organization that monitors this. But the number -- from 2006 to the present time in Afghanistan, the estimate is that drones have engaged and killed some 2600 al-Qaeda and Taliban combatants. Out -- the same organization estimates 330 civilian casualties. Now, once again, please don't take the -- that my view is that it doesn't matter. It matters a hell of a lot, and I think Kael is -- and Mr. Rashid have made this point. It matters a lot, but you have to keep this in perspective, and the numbers are pretty clear, one to seven, one to five, you know, you can say that that's anecdotal, but it's the best we have. And my point is, is that I know what the kids do. And I would ask all the parents in here if your youngster as we were talking out in the reception earlier was on the ground, what would you prefer to have in the air, something that passes over in 30 seconds and goes away or something that is overhead constantly and provides surveillance and an ability to engage the enemy that might well keep that soldier, sailor, airman, Marine safe?

I had lived five out of my seven years in these wars with Marine grunts. Surveillance overhead is a part of war. The issue is when the drones strike, what the net effect is. In Province on the border with Pakistan I can tell you when those one to five, one to seven -- I think numbers to me is not an issue I like to get into because it's that equals sign. Which is how many family members, tribal members, community members are affected by one loss of life? The IED strikes are where most of our guys are losing their legs. So do the IEDs go up when an operation like that goes wrong, and you've got a cousin in Miranshah, you've got brothers in Miranshah, and you live in Khost? I would argue with all due respect that the odds of getting a Marine or a soldier's legs blown off go up because of this program, not go down.

There is that potential, but that's what best military advice is all about. Remember, we have a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is the president's principal military advisor. And if you've watched Mike Mullen, or Marty Dempsey, or in his day Denny Blair, offer military advice, it's not to encourage political leadership to be reckless.

Denny wishes I was an admiral. Maybe some people in the Air Force wouldve, too. I don't know. Let me just say that I think that our partners here in the debate tonight have expressed absolutely legitimate concerns. And while we've jousted a bit, it's been done with respect and an appreciation for their passion and their conviction on this issue. I'd just like to relate a quick vignette. In earlier days, when I was flying airplanes, I flew a gunship -- a C1 -- it's a C-130 with guns on it. And there was one occasion when I remember the following call came from the ground. And it was this -- troops in contact need help now. When an airman hears -- no matter what service -- Navy, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force -- hears "Troops in contact need help now," there is an immediate response. And it is visceral, but not necessarily as accurate or as coherent as you might like it to be if you were -- if you could have been there for hours prior, and will remain there for hours after, which is the case with the remote aircraft or the drone technology today. I would just conclude by saying that use of drones is neither sport nor a failed tactic. And you must vote against the proposition and the adverb "fatally. " Thank you.

The US drone program is fatally flawed|i2Debates/091013 drones.p|239|R4|JOHN KAEL WESTON|for|4|14|7|2|0|26|0|42|0|0|2|1|51|11|2|7|8|0|0|1|0|226|7|0|7|0|0|11|15|0|1|5|25|0|0|5|7|2|0|6|25|9|4|31|47|29|62|2|29|0|0|2|0|4|35|16|0|5|4|9|67|6|2|4|33|430|Thank you. And I would echo what the general just said. I -- this is raising the level of debate and we should all be grateful for that. I've got two minutes and I'm going to run through these pretty quickly. I opened with a quiz about what words or nouns, adjectives you think they associate with the United States of America after 12 years of constant warfare. I don't have time to ask you what those words are, but occasionally I would hear words like Apple -- they had the Apple phone -- Obama, money. But unfortunately, toward the top of that list was D for drones. It wasn't D for democracy. It actually, to be frank, wasn't the nation-building. It was the CT. It was the counter- terrorist platform. And I think we should think about that. Do we want that to be kind of at the top of the list of what they think about us after 12 years, billions of dollars, thousands of Americans killed, over 100,000 Iraqis, et cetera, et cetera? The second point I'm going to now just cite to the question of what happened on May 1st, 2010? I think it was Admiral Blair who referenced this. And I'll add a little detail. It was Faisal Shahzad, who just a few blocks from here tried to blow up the blue 1993 Nissan Pathfinder. In that Pathfinder was three 20-gallon propane tanks, a big green metal gun locker that contained a metal pressure cooker pot, 250 pounds of urea based fertilizer, and eight plastic bags with 120 M88s. The New York City police commissioner, Ray Kelly, said the bomb would have killed many. The police later on said it would have had shrapnel and probably killed mostly tourists but a number of people. What did Faisal Shahzad say? New Yorkers get that. What did -- I used to ride my mountain bike through there, but I didn't go very often -- Faisal Shahad was asked by a judge what motivated him to try and blow up that Nissan. Here's what he said, "Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq," he said finally, "They don't see children. They don't see anybody. They kill women, children. They kill everybody. It's a war. And in war they kill people. " One final point, Boston Marathon bombing, April 15, 2013, I don't have time to read what Dzhokahar Tsarnaev said, but basically he said the same thing, "We Muslims are one body. You hurt one, you hurt us all. The U.S. government is killing our innocents. "

Thank you very much. Our motion is "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " And here to summarize his position against the motion, Dennis Blair, former director of national intelligence. Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Blair.
The US drone program is fatally flawed|i2Debates/091013 drones.p|241|R4|DENNIS BLAIR|against|2|4|8|1|0|23|0|34|4|1|7|1|48|14|1|5|6|0|1|1|0|183|1|0|2|0|0|3|13|0|0|9|27|0|0|4|4|5|1|3|20|3|2|22|49|32|54|3|41|0|0|0|0|0|25|26|0|4|2|5|61|7|2|6|15|301|I've listened closely to our debaters on the other side. And there are an awful lot of anecdote and generalization there. Let me tell a quick story from November 2011, a U.S. patrol that was on the eastern border of Afghanistan, on Pakistan, thought it was being fired on in the night, called for close support fire. A U.S. manned armed helicopter came up, under direction of these ground units fired at the units they thought were threatening them, and ended up killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. Things happen that are bad in war whether you have manned systems or unmanned systems. Things happen that affect U.S.-Pakistani relations whether you have manned systems or unmanned systems. This is the nature of combat and you have to make a balanced judgment about it. I do find it ironic to be on this side of the motion because as Mr. Weston said I was one of the first people who came out in public against some ways in which the drones were being used in Pakistan well over two years ago. However, I was not against the technology itself. I was against the way it was being used at that time. I think we've adjusted since that time. I think that's the nature of this dynamic campaign against a group that's shown it's wanted to kill us, and has killed us in the past, and wants to kill us in the future. So I believe you have to vote against this motion. That doesn't mean that you like all of the drone program, doesn't mean you think it needs to be adjusted, changed, and the narrative needs to be improved, but I don't think we should take it out of the hands of those who are trying to defend the United States. Thank you.

The day that even your allies, that drones become a kind of free for all in this world. After all, the whole crisis that we are facing today over Syria is that the danger of chemical weapons becoming a free for all. Because so many rogue states hold chemical weapons, and if you allow this one to get away then others can follow suit quite easily. And the other thing I'd really like to mention here is that the use of drones has immensely complicated America's relations with its allies. You look at the situation in three countries where drone bases have been set up secretly, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The U.S. set up drone bases with the help of the local regime, which were invariably dictatorships of one kind or another. They lied to their own people, these governments. They lied and said, "No, no, there's no such thing as U.S. bases here. There're no drone bases here at all. These are -- people are being killed by artillery shells, or by bombing, or something else. And what happened was that the public became more and more anti-regime and anti-American, which led to political crises in certainly two of these three countries. And it could well still lead to a political crisis in Saudi Arabia. So, you have now such a complicated scenario operating, where drones are creating -- I mean, one weapon, one weapon, and the use of this weapon is delegitimizing regimes in the region and also creating immense hatred for the United States. Now, this is just one aspect of what I see as a future fraught with immense problems related to drones, which we are not even beginning to think about and I --

And we'll lock it out in about 15 seconds. And we'll have the results in about 90 seconds. And while we're doing that, one thing I want to do -- I felt that this debate tonight had a -- an emotional undertone to it. These are very, very passionate issues and difficult ones. And yet, the level of the debate was remarkably civil and informed and respectable, so I want congratulate all of our debaters -- -- for bringing that. And I also -- I'd also like to thank everybody who got up to ask a question. They were all good questions tonight, so thank you for that. And nobody debated the debaters, and that was even better. So thank you to all of you -- all of -- -- I want to point out that tonight, the president is giving a speech in 32 minutes. He's laying out the case for military action in Syria following this suggestion put forward by the Russians, to have international monitors go in and lock down the chemical weapons. It's only a month ago, actually, that Intelligence Squared was in Aspen. And we debated the following motion: the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria. So in light of that speech, I thought you would like to hear what the results of that debate were. Again, the motion was the U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria. At the end of the debate, 61% of the live audience in Aspen was in support of that motion. And that was a gain for them of 21 percentage points. 33 percent were against. So, they only picked up three percentage points. So, that was a clear win for the side that was voting to keep America out of this fight. As it happens, one of those winning debaters is with us tonight -- Richard Falkenrath. I just want to ask you to take a little bow. He was dying to ask a question tonight, but you're a stage guy, not an audience guy. I'd like to also just ask -- remind you about Tweeting about the debate. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US. We're delighted if you Tweet afterwards your reaction to how it was handled and the results of the vote. The hashtag is #drones. Our next debate is on October 16th here. The motion is: Break Up the Big Banks. Supporting the motion -- supporting the break-up -- Richard Fisher. He's president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. And his partner is Simon Johnson. He's a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Opposing them -- opposing the bank break-up -- Douglas Elliott. He is a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former investment banker -- and Paul Saltzman, who is president of the Clearing House Association, which is America's oldest banking association. Other topics coming up this fall include the global job markets, the second amendment, and the case for going vegan. Tickets are available at our website for that one -- www.IQ2US.org. On Friday, October 18th, we'll be in California debating this motion, For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. Watch the -- -- you can watch that live streamed. It's going to be noon on the East Coast and 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast. Of course, as we've said before, our live stream is on FORA.tv, but you can also hear our debates, including this one, on NPR stations around the country and on WNYC. And our website has information updated on all of these items. So we have the final vote results. Remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms before the debate and after the debate will be declared our winner. The motion is this, "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. " The vote went this way before the motion, 23 percent agreed that the program is flawed, 34 percent were against, 43 percent were undecided. Those are the first results. Remember, now, this change in votes. The second vote, "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed. The team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 23 percent. They gained zero. That is the number to beat. The team arguing against the motion, their first vote was 34 percent. Their second vote was 64 percent. That's a gain of 30 percentage points. The motion "The U.S. drone program is fatally flawed" has been defeated. Our congratulations to that team. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

Corporations, on the other hand, have been divided pretty equally between Democrats and Republicans, in part because they want to hedge their bets, and in part because they don't want to offend any of their customers. So in some sense, this legislation -- I'm sorry, court decision, really opens the door not so much for corporations but for wealthy individuals.

And now let's welcome our debaters to the stage, everybody. Okay. Thank you. And I just would like to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making this possible. Deep and durable and well-known by all of us is the influence and place of money in American politics. If you go to that famous quip by one of the all-time politicos of American history, Mark Hanna, an Ohio Republican, this is what he said: "There are two things that are important in politics. The first is money. And I can't remember what the second one is. " Hanna died in 1904. He did not have super PACs. But we do, and we have a debate.

I'm John Donovan, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, all of whom have grappled with the question of where money fits into a system that we refer to as democracy. We debate, as always, in three rounds. Then the audience votes to choose the winner. And only one side wins. Let's meet our debaters. Let's meet our debaters. On the side for the motion, "Two Cheers for Super PACs," David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics. Your partner is Jacob Sullum. He is a senior editor at Reason Magazine. On the side arguing against the motion, Trevor Potter. He is president and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center. And your partner is Jonathan Soros. He is a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and cofounder of Friends of Democracy. We're going to introduce our debaters once again in more depth for our television broadcasts. And I know you just applauded your hearts out for them. But when I name them again, I'm going to ask you to do that one more time. Thank you. Our motion is "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated. " Let's meet our debaters and welcome first, David Keating. And, David, earlier this year, you became president of the Center for Competitive Politics. It represented a group that you also founded in a landmark case that was SpeechNow.org versus the Federal Election Committee. Citizens United gets most of the credit for the fact that we have super PACs. But without SpeechNow, we would not have them at all. And in addition to that involvement, you also spent a lot of time in your career working on tax policy. So the question is, which is the more twisted set of legislation: campaign finance or tax policy?

I think largely what we have tonight is a debate about the First Amendment and what it means and whether we still value the First Amendment. Do we want to keep the First Amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to say something else? And who will say what that "something else" is? First, let's review what it says. It's pretty simple actually. The part that we're talking about tonight is Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. Well, I'm sorry to inform that we have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech. The Supreme Court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on political speech. We have laws and regulations that come to -- close to 400,000 words. But these words are not clear enough so the Federal Election Commission has already issued close to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means. And on top of that, there have been nearly eight -- 7,000 enforcement actions by the Federal Election Commission during its history. To really understand the law, you need to understand all that. And the fact is no one does understand what the election law means. In fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire a lawyer like this one over here. I don't know how much he charges, but most grassroots groups probably can't afford it. And if they don't have a lawyer, they're probably going to make mistakes. I lived under this, working at a political committee. I saw the regulations firsthand, and we -- a lot of this we're getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn't get an answer to many of our basic questions. On top of that, in 2002 Congress passed the McCain-Feingold Act, and for many of us that was the last straw. A portion of that -- not all of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive no matter what our views on politics. Part of it said that within 60 days of an election, a group that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the name of a congressman if it aired on radio or TV. That was illegal. Now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that. I thought that was outrageous. And there is no group fighting on the political front for the First Amendment. We hear about groups fighting for Second Amendment rights but not First Amendment rights. That's why I started SpeechNow.org because I think we need a group to fight for our political free speech rights. Now, I designed this group in a way that I thought would allow us to be effective. In fact, one of our panelists who doesn't support free speech -- unfettered free speech has adopted the SpeechNow.org model, which is now called a super PAC. And basically here's how it works. It's Americans getting together and pooling their money. I talk to you. I make the case as to why you should donate money, so then we can talk to other Americans. That's what the SpeechNow model was. There was only one problem with it. It was illegal to do that. So the SpeechNow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued the FDC, to make a long story short, we won. That case, SpeechNow.org versus FDC, is what created the super PAC. Now, let me explain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different from normal PACs. These are different from political parties. These are literally Americans getting together independently. The Federal Election Commission calls these groups "independent expenditure only committees" because that's all they can do. We don't make any donations to candidates. We dont make any donations to political parties. We don't coordinate our speech with the candidates. We don't coordinate our speech with the political parties. All of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on the Internet on the FDC website. And all of our spending is donated -- is reported as well. That is what the media has come to call a "super PAC. " So when you think about it, what's wrong with that? It's basically a group of people getting together and saying, "Hey, we want to speak to our fellow Americans about what direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, who should represent us, and we're not going to give any money to the candidates or the parties. " That's what a super PAC is. Now, this model has been so popular that there are now 805 of them that have formed since June of 2010 when super PACs first became legal. Now, I want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech. And I will go back to 1967, when a U.S. senator named Gene McCarthy wanted to run for president. The incumbent president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a very powerful political figure. Today most people would think it'd be impossible to take down a sitting president in a primary, especially if you started in November previous to the election year. But Gene McCarthy did it. And you know how he did it? He went to a handful of people, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today's dollars of $10 million, $10 million. Now, that's the kind of money that we're talking about in super PACs, but back then, the money went directly into Gene McCarthy's campaign committee. Gene McCarthy was opposed to the Vietnam War. He wanted to make his run for president based on opposing the Vietnam War. And he wanted to help build a movement to help end the Vietnam War. He couldn't have done it without those contributions. He couldn't have done it. And you know what? He did it. He didn't win the nomination, but he forced LBJ out of the race. And it's the only time since -- since we've passed these campaign restrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger. And I daresay it probably won't happen for many, many years. So if you believe in the right of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to do everything they can to speak to other Americans. And independent political groups are the way to do it. Thank you.

It may surprise our worthy opponents, but all of us on the stage tonight recognize and celebrate the importance of the First Amendment, the right each of us has as citizens to criticize the government and speak freely. We are all American patriots in this room tonight, not supporters of King George III. None of us believe that the crown, or our government, should be free of criticism. But our opponents want this to begin and end as a debate about the First Amendment, and only about their view of the First Amendment. They want to ignore the rest of the Constitution and the functioning of the government that we the people created. The Constitution created a congress that represents the will of the people, the voters. It created a president whose job is to faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress. What we have learned over the last 200 years, by sad experience, is that our government can be corrupted by campaign money so that it primarily responds to the sources of money that fund elections -- special interests and big political contributors and spenders -- rather than representing the people and seeking the common good. So tonight I'm going to look at how campaign money can corrupt our government and why, for 100 years, there have been limits on money spent in politics to try and control that corruption. Then, my debating partner Jonathan Soros will explain why super PACs and their related nonprofit C4s and C6s only make the possibility of corruption greater. Theodore Roosevelt began this national discussion in 1905 after being elected president with huge contributions from Wall Street. He actually had Mark Hanna. And Mark Hanna had what we would call super PAC money, unlimited contributions from corporations that elected Roosevelt. Afterwards, those corporations came to him for their reward which they expected would be less government regulation. Roosevelt responded by saying to Congress, "All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law. Directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes. " Later, he said, "Every special interest is entitled to justice, but none is entitled to a vote in Congress to a voice on the bench. " Congress reacted to Roosevelt's call by passing the Tillman Act in 1907 forbidding corporate political contributions in federal elections. Later in 1947, the Taft Act extended this prohibition to labor unions and to independent expenditures. Roosevelt and the Congress believed that the election of representatives of the people to Congress should be left to individual citizens and voters, not corporate or union interests almost always seeking special legislative favors in return. Under President Richard Nixon, these prohibitions were violated because of a lack of disclosure. Then in the Watergate scandal, these hidden violations became public. We learned that the Department of Justice had dropped an antitrust case against ITT in return for $400,000 given to finance the Republican convention where Nixon wanted it. We might never have known that except an ITT lobbyist wrote it all down in an internal memo which then saw the light of day. The result was that after Watergate, Congress passed new reform laws and tried to require the disclosure of all money given for political purposes. These laws were later revised and strengthened in the McCain- Feingold law in 2002. As Senator Alan Simpson said at that time, too often members' first thought is not what is right or what they will believe, but how it will affect fundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue? The goal of each of these laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action or inaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns. Just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption. As the Supreme Court said in the Buckley case in 1976, Congress has the right to deal with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permitting unlimited financial contributions. The Supreme Court also recognized one other reality in that case which is central to our debate today. There is a significant difference between my speaking myself or giving my money to someone else for their speech. My own speech and my own words has higher First Amendment protection than a contribution. That brings us to the world of super PACs. They were created, as we heard, by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision and the DC circuit's SpeechNow case. The majority in Citizens United, overturning previous decisions, said that in their view of the First Amendment, corporations had the same right as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal elections because such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. The court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can never corrupt on two important predicates. The spending must be totally independent of candidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words of Justice Kennedy and Citizens United, the public can see whether elected officials are in the pockets of so-called money interests. So are their spending totally independent of candidates? Do we have full disclosure? Jonathan Soros will tell us in a few minutes.

And a reminder of where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this of two who are fighting it out over this motion: "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overrated" -- you have -- sorry. Not overrated. I'm going to say that again so that -- so that that can be edited out. It's great to control the process. "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated. " You have heard two opening statements, and now onto the third to debate for the motion: "Two Cheers for Super PACs," a senior editor at Reason Magazine and reason.com, an award-winning journalist and author of the critically acclaimed books, "Saying Yes," and "For Your Own Good," Jacob Sullum.

I feel a little bit under qualified for this debate because I think I'm the only panelist who has not created a super PAC. Although I briefly contemplated starting an anti-anti-super PAC super PAC. It seemed too complicated to me, but maybe Trevor could help me out. So I'm talking instead from the perspective of somebody who has been writing about civil liberties issues for about 25 years now. And I see this as fundamentally an issue of freedom of speech. Consider the legal situation before the Citizens United case. Wealthy individuals were free to speak without limit. Jonathan's father, for example, spent about $24 billion during the -- or excuse me, million dollars during the 2004 election season to defeat George W. Bush. And more power to him. Media corporations such as the ones that own FOX news and the New York Times were also free to speak without limit. Parties and candidates could spend as much as they wanted on political messages, although the contributions for them were limited. By contrast, unions, businesses and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the NRA or the ACLU, could not talk about their issues on the air close to an election if they happen to mention the name of a candidate for federal office. Furthermore, as David mentioned, people of lesser means could not get together and pool their resources to use for election-related messages unless they registered with the FEC and were subject to strict contribution limits. People often overlook what was actually at issue in the Citizens United case. This was a documentary that was produced by a conservative group, Citizens United. It was called "Hillary: The Movie. " They wanted to air it during the 2008 election season, and they were prohibited from doing so. Why? First of all, it mentioned a candidate for federal office. She was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. And two, it made her look bad. Now, whatever you think about Hillary Clinton or about this particular movie about her, how can that possibly be consistent with a constitutional provision that says "congressional shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech"? The Supreme Court concluded that it could not. And it also concluded that the First Amendment made it -- forced it to override an earlier rule that said you cannot engage and express advocacy if you are a corporation or a union, meaning you explicitly were advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. You frequently hear a couple of arguments in response to this decision from people who didn't like it. First of all, they say, money is not speech. Well, that's literally true. But you do need money in order to get your message across to a mass audience. So I suppose Congress passed a law saying newspapers can exist, but they can't spend any money. Or newspapers can exist, but they can only spend up to this amount of money. Clearly, that would be abridging the freedom of the press. Similarly, if Congress said, you can spend as much as you want if you're a newspaper, but we're going to limit how much you can take in from advertisers and readers. So once you understand that this is really controlling -- money in effect is controlling speech, I think you also have to recognize that loosening these regulations on speech does not mean empowering people to buy elections. Why? Because the messages that you pay for still have to persuade voters. You're still talking about convincing people to vote a certain way. There are a number of striking illustrations from recent elections that show you that money can't buy you love. And I'll just give you a couple of them. One from 2010, Linda McMahan is trying again this year. She spent $46 million of her own money on a Senate campaign in Connecticut. It was nearly a hundred dollars for every vote she received. She lost by 12 points. This year, Jeff Lake won the Republican nomination for the Senate in Arizona. Even though he was outspent two to one, he won by 48 points. So clearly, money is not the whole story. It is, nevertheless, true that in general, the people who win tend to spend more. But it's also true that stronger candidates tend to attract more money. Well, what makes a candidate strong? There are various characteristics that you can imagine that would make people both better able to raise money and better able to get votes, charisma, popular policy positions, but one of the most important is incumbency. And incumbency gives people tremendous advantages in terms of visibility, the power to dispense pork, name recognition, and the reelection rates for members of Congress are insanely high. I mean, historically, in the past few cycles, 90 percent or more even in the last -- in the 2010, when Democrats lost a bunch of seats, it was still about 85 percent. So incumbents have this huge advantage and they use campaign finance regulations to reinforce that advantage. One great example is the so-called Millionaires Amendment, which was part of McCain-Feingold Act. It said that if you face an opponent who is spending his own money, he's financing his own campaign, then we're going to lift the limits on the contributions you can get. So this is clearly designed to help out incumbents who are facing self financed challengers. Another argument you often hear is that corporations are not people. Well, that's also literally true, but corporations are created by people. I mean, they're not created by robots or dolphins or extraterrestrials. I mean, they're created to achieve certain goals. The question in Citizens United was whether people lose the right to freedom of speech when they organize themselves as corporations. I think people tend to think when you hear the word "corporation" of these huge businesses like Wal- Mart or Exxon Mobile, but, you know, every one of us works for a corporation. This debate tonight is sponsored by a corporation. The groups that are complaining that corporations have too much influence over politics are themselves corporations, right? So you have to understand that corporations overwhelmingly consist of small businesses and nonprofits, not these huge businesses. And they represent all sorts of points of view and take on all sorts of issues. Our moderator, by the way, works for a corporation, Walt Disney Company, correct?

Now, that was an exemption, a media exemption for media corporations, that journalists took for granted, but it's very hard to justify under the First Amendment because when you talk about the freedom of the press you're not talking about the freedom of members of professional news organizations, you're talking about the freedom to use technologies of mass communication. That's a freedom that we all have that's guaranteed to all of us by the First Amendment. So by lifting the restrictions on the money that people could collect and spend on political messages, these two decisions, Citizens United and SpeechNow, signal that freedom of speech is not a privilege that's reserved to billionaires or to media corporations or to politicians, it's a right that belongs to all of us no matter how we choose to organize ourselves. And I think we're seeing benefits from that in terms of diversity of voices and greater competition in elections that we can talk about later. Thank you.

I can see that we're going to have a lot to talk about tonight, but my partner, Trevor Potter, laid out the case for why in response to the First Amendment we still have an important interest in mitigating the corruption that can result from even independent political activity but from in particular from contributions to candidates. I'm going to take us on a closer look at the proposition, itself, "Two cheers for super PACs," and suggest that we don't even have the rules that super PACs were premised on. Mr. Keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super PACs are, but that doesn't really resemble what they are in fact. After 40 years of Supreme Court intervention, what we have is more loophole than law. Let's start with the issue of independence. As my partner mentioned, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that speech that is independent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted. Let's set aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed up and said, "I'm going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position X or position Y," that that's not going to have some influence on candidates or elected officials. We'll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what "independent" really means today because the rules around what independent is for super PACs are basically nonexistent. There are in effect only two rules that apply. One, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and what their resources are with a super PAC, and the super PAC may not give a contribution directly to the campaign. Obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, like spending lots of money on television. There are more rules about what Goldman Sachs' partners can say to each other than there are about what super PACs can say to candidates. We've all seen the jokes that this leads to. My partner's super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, has been referenced several times. It's one of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months. I would strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it. It's really funny. But what we're seeing in that -- and they've provided a tremendous example -- is that there are, in effect, no lines between super PACs and candidates. Let's just give a couple of examples. Candidates can raise money for super PACs. They can show up at their fundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit. But then what happens after they leave? Who knows? We all know, at least in the presidential election, the super PACs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates, in both instances. Candidates can endorse super PACs. You hear Mitt Romney talking about "my" super PAC. And just in the last couple of weeks, since we've watched the conventions, we heard about Karl Rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to President Bush and to many other Republicans, getting briefings about his super PAC around Tampa. And last week in Charlotte, Rahm Emmanuel, who had been, at one time, White House chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the Obama campaign, left that position and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention about how he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the Obama-aligned super PAC. So, clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke. That, in effect, leaving aside what's happened in the super PAC, has undermined something we thought we had before. We thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very good reason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions to candidates. Now, those rules still technically exist. You can still only give $2,500 to a candidate. You can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party. But you can then turn around and give $25 million to a super PAC that's working, essentially, as a surrogate for the campaign. Though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 are irrelevant to most of the population anyway. It's only 1 percent of 1 percent of the population that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities. Well, now, with super PACs, we've seen that shrink even further. So 200 people account for 80 percent of the money that was raised for Super PACs, at least as of the last filing. Lastly, let's talk about transparency. It's true; super PACs do have to disclose their donors and their expenditures. Transparency is something that the Supreme Court speaks glowingly of in Citizens United and other cases. But there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollars through, right? You don't have to give your political money to a super PAC. You can give your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations can give them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as super PACs can do, and they don't have to disclose their donors. So when people say, "How much money is being spent in this election? " the answer is, "We actually don't really know. " We know that it will be more than ever before, but we don't know exactly how much, and we don't know exactly where it's coming from. These are problems that can be addressed. We can have rules on transparency that address disclosure of all political spending that's related to the election. We can have rules, coherent rules, around independence that require that super PACs are at least an arm's length distance from the campaigns. We need a functioning enforcement agency, and I hope that we'll have a chance to talk a little bit about the dysfunction of the FCC later on. But none of this will make a difference without an alternative. A friend of mine likes to say that transparency alone is like the webcam that was at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico showing us the Deep Water Horizon well, right? Shows you everything that's spewing into the Gulf, but it doesn't do anything to fix it. We need an alternative. We need a system of citizen- funded elections that allow candidates to run for political office without dependence on large contributions and big donors. That's commonly known as public financing, but when you think about it as a system that is designed to change the incentives of candidates, then it becomes something slightly different. If you think about a system we have in New York where, if you're participating in the system, $175 contribution is matched six-to-one. What's the result? It's transformed the way that funds are raised for city offices here in New York. Instead of going to the Plaza or the Waldorf, you're going to people's living rooms and dining rooms talking to normal folks, constituents about what the interests of their community are. So if the premise of this debate had been "money and politics is badly regulated," I would have happily switched sides and sat over there and argued that case. But the answer to the current lawlessness is better rules, not less of them.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. Now we move on to round two. And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and you in the audience. Our motion is this: "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated.
Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|37|R3|JOHN DONVAN|moderator|8|7|4|0|0|15|0|25|0|0|3|1|29|11|0|6|6|0|0|0|0|129|2|0|1|0|0|0|9|0|0|0|20|0|3|3|3|0|0|2|2|1|4|9|32|23|34|5|24|0|0|0|0|0|16|17|0|3|2|3|32|0|4|4|11|221|" We have two teams of two arguing it out. David Keating and Jacob Sullum are arguing for Two Cheers. They say that in a world where political speech depends on money, you don't want to put limits on either of those things; that, in fact, super PACs and spending of money in politics has the effect of extending and widening political discourse and that attempts to regulate it usually are instigated by politicians who are already sitting in office and don't want their competition to be financed and elected either. On the other side, Trevor Potter and Jonathan Soros are making the argument against super PACs. They're saying that unlimited money puts people into office who are then beholden to the suppliers of the unlimited money. The larger the amount, the more beholden that they'll be, especially if the source of the money is secret. They say that what's needed is a better and saner system of regulation, but that regulation, there must be. I want to put a question to the side that is arguing for super PACs. Your opponents have really hammered at the theme that money is corrosive in politics, essentially that votes can be bought. And I didn't hear in your statements from either of you that you are especially agitated about that phenomenon. David Keating.
Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|38|R3|DAVID KEATING|for|0|14|0|0|0|9|0|18|0|0|2|0|31|8|0|2|12|0|0|0|0|102|0|0|1|0|0|3|6|0|0|1|6|0|1|2|6|0|0|3|5|1|0|10|21|21|19|5|13|0|0|0|0|0|13|9|0|3|2|1|29|1|0|2|12|161|Well, there is really no evidence that votes can be bought. The voters still -- No, come on. We -- out of 58 candidates who used 500,000 or more of their own money in federal races in 2010, fewer than one in five won. So my point is simple: That money does not control the outcome of the election. I'm not saying money isn't important, but it's just one factor. I do also want to point out a lot of what you just heard from Jonathan is just simply wrong about the regulations. He said, for example, we don't know how much is spent in the election. That's simply not true. Any independent expenditure that is run in the election needs to be reported to the Federal Election Commission. That is a law. Now, you can argue about whether people are abiding by the law or not. But they -- I think, by and large, people are reporting their independent expenditures.

It's not that bad a problem. Take that, Trevor Potter.

David's talking about whether you can guarantee you're going to win an election if you spend a lot of your own money. That's -- we're not saying that. What we're saying is that we have a history in this country. It's human nature that candidates who become office holders are going to be grateful to the people who put them there if they can identify somebody who spent an enormous amount of money to elect them. They are going to feel beholden to them rather than everyone else.

Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|44|R3|JACOB SULLUM|for|1|16|8|0|0|15|0|27|0|0|2|1|40|18|0|7|4|0|0|1|0|168|3|0|0|0|0|1|10|0|0|5|27|0|9|3|3|2|0|0|6|1|5|13|44|27|47|8|17|0|0|1|0|3|18|12|0|13|0|3|41|1|2|2|13|276|Yeah. I mean, actually, it often goes unnoted that in most states it was perfectly legal for corporations and unions to spend money on political campaigns even prior to Citizens United, and there's no evidence that the states that allowed unlimited spending by unions and corporations were more corrupt than the states that didn't. You would expect there to be some evidence if it's the case that money is corrupting. That doesn't seem to be the case. I mean, it seems commonsensical that obviously money buys people's votes. But in fact if you look at the research that's been done, there's very little evidence that legislators are actually driven by the campaign donations they're receiving as opposed to their party's interest, their constituents' interests, things that might appeal to the voters who elected them. By the way, I find a lot of that, at least as troubling as selling your vote for money. I think that is something to be concerned about, selling your vote for money. But I think we should be more focused on the actual policies being introduced by politicians. And if they're good policies for bad reasons, I prefer that to bad policies for good reasons. So, you know, for a politician to do something like take other people's money from around the country and spend it on some pork barrel project in his district and then go to brag to voters about this and say, "Reelect me. Look how great I am," he's basically stealing other people's money from around the country and using that money to buy the votes of the voters. And to me that's at least equally troubling.

But issue advertising is not disclosed. There's a lot of that going on this summer. It doesn't flow through independent expenditure committees, and so it doesn't get disclosed. So in the aggregate, we actually don't know the answer. So I don't think we want to get bogged down on that. I think one of the things we should think about here is the definition of corruption in the first instance. And because we're not only talking about buying a vote, that there's actually a deal that says, I'm going to hand you this money, and you're going to vote this way. We're talking about, A, that does -- that is an issue that can be prosecuted. It doesn't happen --

I'm not saying everyone does this. I'm saying two things: First, it definitely has happened across the country and in our history. There is a long series of affidavits in the McCain-Feingold litigation and testimony from members of Congress and, not surprisingly, former members who feel freer to speak about it saying, I see votes affected all the time by where the money came from, which industry was being affected. And that's the underlying corrosive problem, plus the amount of time that these members spend, which is now estimated at up to 70 percent of their working days raising money. Those are the problems we face.

And you can't point to a single member of Congress, to a single independent expenditure where they have felt this kind of pressure. It hasn't happened. And it's not going to happen. Now, we can argue about the rules we may need to ensure the independence of these groups. But we think these groups should be able to independently raise as much and speak as much to the American people. The difference between Americans getting together and speaking to other Americans is one thing. Americans and contributing directly to candidates may be a separate issue. I'd also like to point out that before the SpeechNow decision and the Citizens United decision, there were many states, in fact a majority of states in the country that allow unlimited contributions not only to independent expenditure committees but to the candidates themselves. I think what we should be looking at is the quality of the government in those states. And Pew, along with Governing Magazine, Pew Charitable Trusts and Governing Magazine, rated the states for quality of governance, efficiency of providing services. And the states, six of the best managed states in the country were states where there were unlimited contributions allowed to these types of super PACs, and most of these states also allowed unlimited contributions to the candidates. So good government, efficient government is consistent with people having full free speech rights.

Number one, they said there's no evidence that politicians are -- once in office are arguing --- are operating as agents of the people who funded them, and, secondly, that there is superior or equally good government in states that have unlimited contribution.

I think in the first instance, I think Mr. Keating is fighting yesterday's battle as it relates to whether groups are allowed to gather together and form super PACs. They are. The question is should there be rules around that and what should those rules be. Our principal argument in ours is that those rules are virtually nonexistent now, and that's a real problem. You're suggesting that there is no evidence of independent expenditures corrupting. I would say we're at the early stages. This is kind of like the year after they invented television, we're looking at television ads, right? We're seeing the first wave of these independent expenditures, and so not clear that that's true, but we're actually not even arguing that, that shouldn't happen, we're not arguing that people shouldn't be allowed to come together in groups and speak in a collaborative voice, in a collective voice. We are arguing that if the evidence presents itself that that is, in fact, corrupting, that you might want to go back and consider regulating that activity as well, but what we are saying is that the rules around independence and separation from the candidates are clearly not there.

We don't know yet what the effect is going to be. And what Jonathan just said was, "If we find out that they have the same corrupting potential that contributions have been found to have, found by the Supreme Court to have, based on lengthy trials, that then they, too -- we will have to look at whether they should be limited. " One of the things that the court did, as I explained in my opening comment, is to say there's a difference between our own independent speech and a contribution to something. The Supreme Court has never faced this question of what happens when you take your own money and you contribute to one of these super PACs and somebody else then decides how to spend the money and what to do on the advertising, is that really your own independent speech which the court has said can't be limited, or is that a contribution to a group, and they have found contributions can be limited to prevent the demonstrated danger of corruption.

" I mean, if you take a very broad definition of it, it's basically any inappropriate consideration, right, that causes you to vote a certain way. Well, some of it is actual quid pro quo corruption where you hand the guy a pile of cash and you say, "Vote my way," and that's definitely illegal, if you can prove it. But if what you're saying is that politicians tend to be grateful for people who support them, or to people support them, then it's true, but that would apply to celebrity endorsements, that would apply not just to super PACs but obviously also to rich people spending their own money independently, which has always been legal, it would apply to voting a certain way because you like the way the lobbyist from that corporation dresses, you think she's pretty. I don't think that's illegal, but it seems improper. You can vote for terrible policies for all kinds of reasons. I think we should be focused more on the policies. I mean, people vote for terrible policies because they have crazy ideologies that drive them to do it, you know. So I don't know why we're focused on this one particular area where there's potential for improper considerations when there are all kinds of other considerations that people might deem improper, and shouldn't we be focusing more on the results, the performance that people actually deliver once they're elected. Is it a good performance, is it bad? And part of that whole process is being able to speak on both sides of that.

In the first instance, with money and we're talking about a class of individuals who have a disproportionate and clear influence over the political process. You made a comment in your opening statement that the increase of money and sort of the increase of spending has generated more diversity of thought. Well, I don't think that we can rely for political diversity on disagreements between rich people. That's not a political process that allows for a full and open debate.

Because when we talk about corruption, we talk about the appearance of corruption, what we're talking about is the integrity of the system of representative government. It's about the belief that citizens have that the people who they elect to office are representing them. And the evidence shows that less than 10 percent of Americans in a Gallup poll believe that their elected representatives are actually working in their interest. That's a dangerous place for a democracy.

So that means the more that Jonathan and Trevor go around talking about corruption and how horrible it is and how everybody's corrupt and, of course, money buys votes and everybody knows it, even if it's completely false, they go around talking about, now everybody's worried about corruption. That justifies whatever regulations they're proposing. It has this sort of circular quality to it. I don't think it should hinge on the appearance of corruption. Maybe it should hinge on the reality of corruption, although I don't buy this argument at all that the fear of even actual corruption, quid pro quo corruption, justifies restrictions on speech. And the Supreme Court has basically said it does. I think they were wrong. I think that they're moving in the right direction now. But I just don't buy it. Is there some kind of, you know, codicil that's attached to the First Amendment that says, "Except when you're worried about corruption, you know, then you can restrict speech"?

And what has been found is the states that have the strongest laws, the most restrictive contribution limits, the people have no more faith in those governments than the states where there are unlimited contributions. This has no affect in the people's opinion about the appearance of corruption or the corruption of policies at the state level. So it simply doesn't work. If the idea is that people are going to have more faith in their government from these restrictive laws that are very complicated, burden speech, and prevent grassroots groups from forming easily, they simply don't work.

The federal government has this enormous power. The Libertarians in the room will be happy I'm saying this. But it has this enormous power over the purse, the tax system, the way much of American life works. And so it makes sense that if you were seeking a major tax break, if you want your aircraft carrier bought, the big money that you would be trying to influence what Congress does, that, it seems to me, is why we see the amount of money being spent on federal elections, and it's vastly more than is going to be spent in state elections, because the benefits of that extra money, if you get your aircraft carrier, your special tax break, the bill that hurts your opponent and saves you, that's huge for the interests that need that.

I want to move to the point, David, when I interrupted you at the beginning in your opening comment. Your opponent Jonathan Soros has described the tangle of federal election laws as a Swiss cheese of loopholes that's ineffective. I don't know if cheese can be effective or ineffective, but you know what I'm saying. In other words, he's saying there are regulations, but they're not regulating. It's not working at any level. And I want you to take that point on.

And I think part of the problem is no one has asked the question whether a candidate can raise money for one of these single-candidate PACs. My view is the candidates cannot do that, and they should not be doing that. And I think it would be helpful if that was made clear. But the laws --

I'm talking about regulating the candidates. To me, that's a different thing. When people -- let me say, the laws on coordination are actually -- they're not as weak as you make them out to be. It's not just a matter of sharing inside information, although that's part of it. There -- and it covers much more than independent expenditures. It's any communication that's run within 90 days of an election is covered by the laws on coordination. And a communication is considered coordinated if it meets one of just any one of five different tests. One is if the communication is requested or suggested by the candidate or if you suggested it somehow to the candidate, and the candidate agreed. You don't need formal collaboration or formal agreement to this from the candidate. If the candidate or their committee or their party is materially involved in the decisions in any way; if someone creates the communication after one or more substantial discussions about the campaign's plans, projects or needs; or if they employ a common vendor and use any of that information, or they use someone who is previously employed by the campaign in the previous 120 days. So --

We may need more rules, and that would seem to support our side of the proposition. But let's talk about the rules that are actually here. You know, David -- I think David has to say that it's important that these groups be independent because the Supreme Court said, in allowing these independent groups to exist, that the reason they wouldn't corrupt and therefore could take unlimited money, they're totally independent of candidate and party committees. As I think Jonathan did a good job of saying, totally independent of candidate and party committees? You do have former campaign aids, lawyers, fundraisers for the candidates running these things. Unfortunately, one of the few times the FEC has not dead locked in the last couple years was actually agreeing that candidates could raise money for these super PACs as long as they did so within only limited amounts. We have incidents this year of the candidates traveling with the principal funder of a super PAC, candidates thanking the super PAC when he left the race saying he couldn't have done it without them. This seems to me not to be totally independent of candidates and parties.

I mean, it does look -- -- get rid of these limits on contributions to candidates then you can raise whatever money you want to raise for your own message, and you will be responsible for your own message, and you can't play this game of saying, oh, we can't coordinate. I can't talk to them. And you have to be responsible for your own speech. That's not to say that you get rid of the genuinely independent voices. But I think if what you're worried about is this sort of sneakiness, you know, it's kind of like, you know, a prostitute who pretends she's an escort, or you go into a head shop, and they got all these fancy water pipes, and it's for -- you know, for use only with tobacco or other legal herbs. And you might say these are very dishonest people. But in fact, it's bad laws that produce that kind of dishonesty. So we've got bad laws we should get rid of.

I want to go in a moment to you in the audience to take questions from you and to remind you that I encourage you to -- to be terse in your questions, to try to really make it a question that's related to our topic. And I'm fine with you stating a short premise, but I really don't want you to make a speech because these are the guys who have to make the speeches. And what will happen is if I call on you, there will be a microphone in the aisle passed over to you. Please stand up. We would appreciate it if you will tell us your name and then hold the microphone about a fist's distance from your mouth. So as that is getting set up, I just want to take one more question -- one more point back to the side that is arguing against super PACs from your opponents. It was very much a thrust of their argument that there is a First Amendment here -- issue in this. And you haven't addressed at all whether in fact there is a valid core at all to their argument that there is a free speech issue here. And, you know, you may -- you may feel that there are other interests that outweigh it, or you may feel there is no free speech and just -- but I want to hear your view on it. Is there anything to it? Jonathan Soros.

That there is a free speech interest here. But what I -- and I wanted to -- I guess we're not going to go back and have time, but I was really startled by the comment about corruption not being a sufficient logic for countervailing some of that. So to focus on "Congress shall pass no law," that's just not true. We have lots of laws that curtail our speech in favor of some other public interest. And here there's a clear public interest in protecting the integrity of our electoral process from the possibility of corruption.

And again, as Trevor indicated -- the Supreme Court actually didn't do a terrible job with this when they addressed the question in Buckley, to say there are different considerations when you are speaking yourself that has a stronger interest than when you are giving money to other folks, when you're making a contribution. And so the limits and the rules that you put around that have to be appropriately tailored to how strong the interests are.

When you're talking about the First Amendment and political speech, you're going to have a free speech issue when you are regulating money in politics. But that doesn't -- that just starts the question. It doesn't answer the question. The Supreme Court itself, in Citizens United said government can't choose among speakers. Listeners have the right to hear every speaker. The government's role is not to decide who speaks. Great absolutist language. The next case that comes along is a group of foreigners who say, good, I want to speak. I live in New York. I happen to work here. I'm not a U.S. citizen. There's a law that says I can't speak. People should hear me. It's a First Amendment right of the American people to hear me. The court throws them out on their ear. So this is not a clean-cut issue. You look at this in balance among other things, as the court has done: The integrity of our government, the importance that people have confidence in the decisions being made, and then you look at where the money is spent, how it is disclosed, what we know. Those are all aspects of this.

And other -- you know, other exceptions like obscenity that I don't necessarily agree with. But I just never -- have never bought this particular argument. Seems invented from whole cloth. And I want to say one thing in favor of disagreeing rich people. Is that how you put it, Jonathan?

I mean, first of all, you have people of more modest means, as David pointed out, who can pool their money as a result of having super PACs. But there is something to be said for disagreeing rich people. You've got billionaires, you know, who favor Democrats, and you have billionaires who favor Republicans. You've got a bunch of rich guys who got together and put together a group called "The Campaign for Primary Accountability," which I love, because what they do is they go around the country. They look for entrenched incumbents of both parties, and they target them for defeat. And I think this is a great thing. And just to give you one example of what most people will consider to be a progressive outcome, there was a congressional race in Texas where Sylvestre Reyes, who was a long-time congressman, very comfortable, terrible on the war on drugs. He was challenged by a guy named Beto O'Rourke. I think that's his name. He's a former city councilman. And he got help from the campaign for primary accountability. And I don't know how much it helped him, but it presumably helped him somewhat, and he won. So you now have a guy who is written in favor of legalizing marijuana, written a book about it in fact. It says we need serious drug policy reform, replacing a hard line drug warrior. Both Democrats, right? So that's an example of how rich people -- disagreeing rich people can -- can aid progressive causes. And of course in the Republican presidential primaries, you had Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich -- these are not the greatest examples, but they did hang in there a lot longer than they would have, thanks to rich guys who gave money to super PACs supporting them. Mitt Romney had challengers who were different in some particular ways from him, not identical, in some ways better than him on certain issues, you know, it's not a great group to pick among, but -- -- but it -- very clearly they could stay in that race. That race was more competitive than it otherwise would have been, thanks to the super PAC money.

" The answer was, "Yes, I saw that money changed what happened in the Congress of the United States.

" There's a guy, a state senator in New York, Roy McDonald, who voted in favor of the Gay Marriage Bill and the primary's tomorrow, right? So he is up for reelection, or he's up for renomination tomorrow, and before he decided to vote in favor of the Gay Marriage Bill, he had assurances from gay rights activists that they would help him raise money to support his campaign. Is that corruption? And I think that your idea of whether that is corruption is going to hinge on your policy views to a large extent. So keep that in mind. I'm -- you know, just think about it.

Jacob kind of stole my thunder at the end with my question, but I would like to get your side to answer it. He pointed to the Republican primary this year, and it actually seems to be more competitive because of the super PACs. Gingrich and Santorum were able to stay in the race longer and gave Mitt Romney a challenge where he otherwise may have been able to mow down them much more easily without his super PACs. Isn't that a positive? More competitive elections?

I don't know that, that was a particular benefit to anybody, that all the sides were armored up significantly larger than they normally would be in a primary. You're right, the primary went on longer because instead of having to worry about for Gingrich whether they were donors who would support him and how he could keep going when he kept losing primaries, all he had to worry about was whether he made one man happy or not -- -- and under these coordination regulations he could go meet with that man and talk to him.

And I'll just comment that there's actually nothing in our current limit system to give people a lot of confidence. As I said in my opening, when you've got contribution limits of $2,500, those are out of reach for most people in America. And $25,000 -- so you end up with a very, very small fraction of people who are contributing as it is. It seems like the system's actually designed to maximize the amount of time that candidates spend with rich people, right? That's one of the reasons that I said, at the end, we really need to be focused on an alternative as well, to focusing on a system where candidates can run for public office where they're not dependent on these contributions.

I think a lot of the false independence you're worried about, this apparent dishonesty, the evasions and so forth, come out of that. And what happens historically with campaign finance regulation is, they impose one rule, people find a way around it; they propose a new rule, people find a way around that; and so on, and so on, and so on. And speech gets more and more restricted. Regulations get more and more complex and intimidating for the average person who might want to get politically involved. And I think we need to -- we cut our losses and make things as simple as possible. I don't buy the distinction between giving versus spending. I think if spending is speech, giving is also speech, or it amounts to speech if you restrict giving. So there should be no limits on giving. I am sort of on the fence about disclosure rules. I think it's legitimate to require candidates, as a condition of running for office, to disclose donors, but I don't think it's necessarily legitimate to require disclosure for independent spenders. There's an argument to be made that that chills speech. In fact, it's designed to chill speech.

I do think it makes sense to allow candidates to decide when they file, as a candidate, what the contribution limit will be, if any, and let the voters decide. So if they want to accept unlimited contributions, the candidates can do that. If the candidates will agree with each other to accept a limit, whether it's today's limit of $2,500 or some other limit of, say, $10,000, let them do that, and let the voters decide. "Do I trust this person taking these kinds of money from these kinds of people? " So I think that makes sense. Now, there are lots of other laws and regulations. As I said, there's -- the laws and regulations have 376,000 words. For a lot of small grassroots groups that just want to say something about their member of Congress, as soon as they spend $1,000, they have to file with the Federal Election Commission. A lot of people just can't navigate these forms and these regulations. And then it's not clear what they're allowed to say and what they're not allowed to say. There are regulations describing what's express advocacy that's regulated by the Federal Election Commission. But people look at the regulation and they don't know what it means. And, in fact, we helped a group that had a question about a number of ads. They submitted nine ads to the Federal Election Commission, and the Commission itself couldn't agree whether it was regulated speech or not. This is not a situation that is good for our country, where people want to speak out about what's going on in the election, and they have to hire a lawyer to do it. We've got to simplify the thing so the election law is not more complicated than the tax law.

But that was one of the arguments that the Obama administration used in favor of keeping the regulations that were overturned in Citizens United. They said there was not only this concern about corruption, but also a shareholder interest. And I guess you're talking about a consumer interest, but it's somewhat similar. I think the answer in both cases is the same. If you're a shareholder in a company, you don't like their political speech, you can -- you can sell those shares, or you can object at a shareholder meeting. If you're a consumer, and you don't like the political speech of the company you're buying from, you can stop buying from them. I mean, you can protest as well. But you have the power to decide where your money is going based on that consideration.

I'm glad that this came up because we haven't talked at all about the corporate question which is actually what Citizens United was originally about. So that's an interesting theoretical argument. The problem is Scott's Miracle-Gro decided, voluntarily, to fund a super PAC, which is one of the few instances of a public company doing that. So if they decide to give their money in a way that's not disclosed, then as a consumer, you have no idea about it and as a shareholder, you have no idea about it. The second thing is that as a shareholder, you may very well have no ability to do anything about it anyway. So let's -- the issue of corporate democracy, we could go on for a long time. But let's just stick with somebody who owns those shares through a pension fund, right? Forty-seven states in this onion, if you're a public employee, you're required to put your money into a pension fund. That money can go anywhere. It can go into any company, and you have no control over it. So there is a problem with corporations speaking because they're speaking on behalf of other people that don't have the ability to give their consent. And you can also suggest maybe you shouldn't have to give your consent in order to participate in the modern economy of owning shares.

My name is Debra Jerkerson. And just going back to David's point that people have a right to sort of organize themselves, or people have a right to change their government, it seems that we're getting into this long conversation about how to regulate money. But on the other hand, you're kind of saying that money doesn't really influence politics. I wanted to go back to what Mr. Soros is saying, what could we look at as a different system such as campaign finance reform, or public funding of campaigns, and how do you think about that?

And it's very hard to design such a system. I think there are a lot of problems with it. I mean, we talk about disconnecting candidates from the people. If they don't have to raise money for their campaigns, we're disconnecting them additionally. But there's also real questions of how you design such a system so that it's attractive so the candidates will even want to do it. We have tax funded campaigns for the presidential candidates. And in this election, both candidates have decided to forego that financing. In other states where they've designed these tax funded campaign systems, they've designed them in such a way as to penalize independent groups that speak out. Now, the Supreme Court has struck down those provisions. But it makes it even more difficult to design such a system. So I don't think it's terribly workable, for one. Second, I don't think it's politically possible to pass, either. When you put together the words basically "tax funding" and "politicians" together, it's not popular. People don't like paying taxes. They don't like their money going to politicians. They don't like politicians generally. So I think if we're looking for solutions to try to make our government more accountable, to provide cleaner government, that that's not something that's probably going to work politically.

And I think both of those things are true, but I don't think this is a debate about what's politically popular or not. It's a debate about what's the right answer. So you can design a system that actually drives politicians towards their constituents. I described it in my opening remarks. So the system we have in New York City where you only get the funding from the city when you raise money from your constituents in small dollars. That transforms the way that people -- people raise money in this city. And you have to make it big enough to -- it's true, we still have, on the books, a presidential public financing system. I don't know what it is this year, but in 2008, it was worth about $110 million. So that's just not a relevant number any more. It has to be robust enough that a candidate opting into the system believes that they can really run a credible campaign.

And this whole notion that underlies this, that you want people to have faith in your government ought to be controversial. There's such a thing as having too much faith in your government. Some people look at these declining ratings for Congress and the federal government, and they say this is terrible. People are losing faith in the government. Other people look at that, and they say, thank God voters are finally wising up, right? And so obviously that's going to depend on your own views about how big government should be, what it should be doing and so forth. But it is not an uncontroversial idea that everyone should have faith in the government.

What the court said is you have to worry about both. You have to worry about actual corruption because that means that government is not doing its job. It's not impartially deciding in the common good. And you have to worry about the appearance because if citizens think that's what's going on, and they look at all this money and they look at who's getting it and the way these super PACs are working linked closely to candidates, and think, "Well, I don't have any role in this, they are all in a league different than mine, and they're getting something for their money," that appearance is a problem for us, too.

I mean, imagine somebody who supports, say, NORML and doesn't want his employer to know that, or he supports NORML, or -- fill in your favorite group, whatever it is, you can imagine reasons why people don't want their support to be widely known. And, in fact, this has been recognized to some extent by the Supreme Court in a case involving the NAACP, where I think it -- was it Alabama -- wanted to force them to disclose all of their supporters. And the Supreme Court said, "No, this is --"

It chills freedom of association and freedom of speech, too. " So I think there is an argument -- a strong argument you've made against forcing those groups to disclose who their supporters are.

But one of -- first of all, it stands also for the proposition that there is an exemption for disclosure if there's a real threat to the members from disclosure -- a clear -- and Alabama at that time, there were clearly threats to members. There was also no state interest at all in getting that membership list in NAACP. So a couple of things on the information . First of all, elections are different, right? There's lots of anonymous political speech in our society, and we don't go around looking for the sources of those speech. But when you're talking about advocating for the election of someone who's going to represent their population, and you want to have that clear connection between the electorate and the elected official to know that they're actually representing their constituency, elections are different. There's an informational component, right, so you want to be able to evaluate the message that you're hearing. And part of being able to evaluate that is knowing who's speaking.

Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|213|R4|TREVOR POTTER|against|6|8|8|2|0|13|0|18|0|0|0|5|45|13|0|9|9|0|0|1|0|123|5|0|0|0|0|2|14|0|1|2|10|0|2|3|9|2|0|0|9|0|5|13|34|11|24|5|27|0|0|0|0|0|18|16|0|4|6|7|30|2|0|1|13|239|Thank you. I'd like you to imagine a state where industrial hog operators began to worry about proposed new environmental regulations that would prevent them from dumping untreated waste into local rivers. Imagine they formed a group called, say, "Farmers for Fairness," to persuade legislators to block such regulation. Imagine they created some campaign ads which attacked legislators by name, never mentioning hog farming at all, but claiming legislators were not in touch with "our values. " But now imagine that Farmers for Fairness did not go out and run these ads, but instead scheduled meetings with legislators and screened the advertisements for them in private. Imagine Farmers for Fairness told the legislators privately that they would hate to run these ads, but would do so if the legislators didn't vote the way they wanted. You don't have to imagine that. It happened in North Carolina, documented by a federal judge in a case called Life v. Leake. But today a super PAC nonprofit could do this in Congress with huge sums of unlimited, undisclosed money at their disposal, and we might never know it happened. Two cheers for super PACs? I don't think so. That would be a problem even if the super PACs complied with the Supreme Court's assumptions about no coordination at all with candidates and party committees and full disclosure of all this money being spent in elections. That is not the system we need.

Our motion is, "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated. " And here to summarize his position in support of this motion, Jacob Sullum, a senior editor at Reason magazine.
Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|215|R4|JACOB SULLUM|for|1|14|7|0|0|41|0|37|5|0|8|4|58|28|0|8|13|0|0|1|0|236|3|5|2|0|0|2|5|0|3|3|33|0|0|2|5|0|0|2|22|5|7|18|52|25|53|5|34|0|0|2|0|1|30|15|0|16|2|14|55|4|1|8|22|415|So during the first round of arguments in Citizens United, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart was asked, "Well, if you can ban this movie, 'Hillary: the Movie,' what about if you have very similar material but it was presented in a different medium, like DVDs or on the internet or even in books? " And he said, "That would be constitutionally permissible too. " This was pretty shocking, because it raised the possibility that the government could ban books in the name of fighting corruption. It was widely seen as the turning point in the case. They had a second round of oral arguments, which was very unusual, prompted largely by this revelation. And during that round, the solicitor general, Elena Kagan, said the government had changed its answer. She said there would be a strong constitutional case against punishing an organization for publishing a book, but that pamphlets were different because they were classic electioneering. Well, that raised new questions. When does a pamphlet become a book? Is it a matter of the number of pages? Is it the kind of cover it has, the binding, or what? Now, the media exemption that I alluded to before, upon close examination, looks equally arbitrary. Citizens United, after all, was producing movies. So why was that, Citizens United, not a media corporation? The NRA started a radio show, daily radio show, after McCain-Feingold was passed, and they said, "Look, we're a media corporation; we're exempt. " If that's legitimate, then why couldn't every advocacy group do the same sort of thing? Does the internet count as a medium? Presumably it does. Then doesn't every group that has a website qualify as a media corporation? This media exemption puts the government in the position of deciding who deserves to have unfettered freedom of speech and who does not, which is precisely the sort of distinctions the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit. And whether you're worried about corruption or you're worried about undue influence, the arguments for regulation are just as strong, if not stronger, in the case of media corporations. So while many of my fellow journalists have supported these kinds of regulations, basically lobbying to keep their own special speech privileges, it's always seemed foolish to me for people who make a living by talking about politics to appoint the government as a sort of national debate moderator, because you never know when the moderator will decide that it's time for you to shut up.

Thank you. Our motion, "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated.

Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|217|R4|JONATHAN SOROS|against|6|14|3|0|0|14|0|27|0|0|3|2|42|17|0|6|5|0|0|0|0|168|5|0|0|0|0|3|15|0|0|5|31|0|0|4|5|0|0|0|15|0|3|24|33|17|57|4|23|0|0|0|0|0|31|9|0|2|8|8|40|11|2|0|17|288|So I'm going to return to this question of Scott's Miracle-Gro, because what's not part of the story yet is that last week Scott's was fined $12.5 million for violations of federal pesticide laws for, among other things, putting toxic insecticide in their bird seed that was killing birds. Now, they got caught doing that, and they actually as far as I could tell, acted admirably. They admitted it. They pled guilty. They entered into an agreement. But they were caught, and that was dealt with because we have laws that protect clean elections -- excuse me -- laws that protect clean air and clean water, and we have an enforcement agency that deals with that. In June, they gave $200,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore our Future. This is not that it was Romney or Obama, but that they gave money to a super PAC. There are no laws in place after Citizens United, no clear legal regime that would require them to disclose that information so that their consumers would know about it, so that their shareholders would know about it, that anybody else would know about it. They could have used a different organization other than the super PAC and done basically the same thing. And we have no effective regulatory agency that will provide us with clean elections. A lot of what our opponents have talked about essentially arguing from the past. They're arguing from pre-Citizens United, pre-SpeechNow. We deserve disclosure of contributions. We deserve an effective disclosure regime. We deserve something that protects our -- the integrity of our political process. The proposition that we're arguing is whether money in politics is still overregulated, and the answer to that is clearly no.

The motion: "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated. " And here to summarize his position in support of the motion, David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics.
Two cheers for super PACS: Money in politics is still overregulated|i2Debates/091212superpacs.p|219|R4|DAVID KEATING|for|6|15|16|0|0|24|0|43|0|0|5|2|55|17|0|9|9|0|0|1|0|208|8|0|0|0|1|0|7|0|2|2|25|0|4|7|4|0|0|4|11|4|15|22|45|35|51|6|30|0|0|4|0|0|39|16|0|9|7|6|62|7|1|3|21|333|Well, since we passed the major campaign finance restrictions in the early 1970s, we've seen competition decline dramatically. We used to see elections that were far more competitive than they are today. The re-election rate has gone up not down. But fundamentally I think what we have to keep in mind here is when -- who is going to write these restrictions? Who is going to write the campaign finance laws and regulations? Well, the answer is it's going to be the incumbent members of Congress. There is no other way to write them. And if there is ever a conflict of interest about how this is going to be written, that's a conflict. They get to write the regulations so they probably will write them so that they will be able to have a better chance at keeping their jobs. They're not so much concerned about our freedom of speech or our ability to criticize the job they're doing. In fact, they would like to see less criticism of it. So basically, this is a debate about who decides what you can say? Should it be us the people getting together and deciding, or should it be the politicians? And should it be the prosecutors who are looking to make a name for themselves? You have to keep in mind many of these laws that are written not only have civil penalties but criminal penalties. And if you think that's far-fetched, the very first political prosecution taken under these laws was a group that took out a full-page ad urging Nixon's impeachment for the invasion of Cambodia. That was the first prosecution under the campaign finance laws. I would say free speech is messy. But the cure of additional regulations written by politicians who want to stay in office is worse than any disease of free speech. So I hope you will support the motion "two cheers, or three cheers, for super PACs. " Three cheers for independent action by the people.

The opposing side, push number two. If you are or became undecided, push number three. And you can ignore all of the other keys and correct your vote, and it will just register the last vote. Okay. So while you're doing that, and while the votes are being tabulated, the first thing I want to say is that this was, for us, relaunching this season in the midst of a political campaign, it was just about a perfect -- just about a perfect target for us. And I think all of us at Intelligence Squared are really, really impressed by the level of debate that these panelists brought to this. It was very serious and informational without being medicinal. It was terrific. So thank you for that. And also, I want to say sometimes we have some tricky times with audience questions. Questions tonight were terrific. So to everybody who got up there and had the nerve, thank you very much for that. A few things about what's coming down the road. First of all, we -- anybody who was Tweeting tonight, thank you for that. And you are welcomed and encouraged by us to Tweet after the debate and get the word out about us. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US. And the hash tag is the same, #IQ2US. Our next debate is on Thursday, October 4. The motion is "Better Elected Islamists than Dictators. " Arguing in support of this motion we're going to have Reuel Marc Gerecht, a senior fellow at the foundation for defensive democracies and a former Middle East specialist; Brian Katulis, he is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who has been focusing on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and South Asia. Arguing against this motion, Daniel Pipes. He is president of the Middle East forum. He is described as perhaps the most prominent U.S. scholar on radical Islam by the Washington Post. And Zuhdi Jasser, he is president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy which he founded to advocate for the separation of mosque and state. October 10th, everybody get on a plane and fly to Chicago because we're going to be doing a debate there. We're taking part in the second annual Chicago Ideas Week. There we are debating the motion, "Ration End of Life Care. " I may later pronounce it "ration. " I haven't decided yet. But you get the point. Tickets and more information about all of the upcoming fall debates can be found on our website, www.iq2us.org. And if you can't make it to the next debate, watch the live stream as we had tonight. Our new partner is the Wall Street Journal's video initiative, WSJ live. And you -- as I said at the very beginning, you can listen to all of our debates online. And this particular debate on WNYC here in New York. Our turnaround time is usually several days. And just look at their schedule. And also for the televised version, WNET and the WORLD digital channel. All right, we have the results in. Remember, our motion is this: "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated. " You heard the heated and intelligent arguments. We've asked you to vote twice, both before the debate and again at the end of the debate. And the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner. And it goes like this: Before the debate, 19 percent were for the motion, 63 percent were against, 18 percent undecided. After the debate, 22 percent are for the motion. That's up 3 percent. 69 percent are against. That is up 6 percent, 9 percent are undecided. That's down 9 percent. That means that the side arguing against the motion in a squeaker has carried this debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donovan. We'll see you next time from Intelligence Squared US.

Hi. Hello. My name is John Donvan, and I will be moderating the debate which begins in about four minutes. I wanted to have a quick chat with you about a few things relating to primarily your role as members of the audience. Normally, we do these debates in New York, and occasionally we go on the road, and it's really a pleasure for us to be here in Chicago. So I'm going to give you the spiel I give you in New York, which is this: We want you as members of the audience not to consider yourself passive listeners. We need you to be the opposite of that. You actually act as the judges in the debate. You choose the winner of the debate. And the way we have you do that, if you see at your seats, there's a keypad. And at the very beginning of the debate, I'm going to state the motion, "Ration End-Of-Life Care," and, before the debate, you agree with this motion, we want you to register that by pushing number one. If you disagree, we want you to push number two. And if you're undecided, push number three. And you can ignore all of the other keys at that point. They are not live. And if you push a key incorrectly, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote. At the end of the debate, after you've heard the arguments, and we're asking you to keep an open mind through the course of the evening. After you've really listened to the arguments and listened closely, we're going to ask you to vote again. And we want to see whose minds have been changed or who came out of undecided to take one of the positions. And the team at the end of the evening whose percentage has changed the most according to your vote is going to be declared our winner. The second way in which your role is critical as members of the audience is that after a round, a formal round of opening statements by each debater in turn, we will then have a session where it's more mixed up. They can address each other and take questions from me. At that point, I also want to take questions from you. And the way that will work is if you just raise your hand, and I find you, just stand up. A microphone will be brought to you, and we want you to hold the microphone about this far away from your mouth. I'll explain why in a second. Basically so that we can hear you. We'd like you to state your name and then ask a question. Now, on the question, this does get tricky in New York at least. We don't want you to debate with the debaters. We -- that's what they're here to do. We want you really to ask a question that will move forward the discussion of this motion. What they're really here to debate and persuade you on is this short statement: "Ration end-of-life care. " So I'd like you to think in terms of asking a question that focuses on that, not a secondary issue. And I'll be fine if you want to make a short, very, very short opening statement of your premise. But then I want you to get to a question. And you'll know that it's a question because if a question mark goes at the end of the statement naturally, then it's going to work. And I will -- I will respectfully decline questions that are really off topic. And I may have to step in and help you phrase your question if you're struggling, but I do follow that very respectfully. We are being broadcast ultimately on NPR stations, on NPR -- on podcast downloads, on television in New York, not live, but we are live streaming right now as we speak. But because of that, a few things you need to know. There are certain formalities that we need to observe for the broadcast. I'm going to have to tell you many, many times that we're in Chicago and many times that I'm John Donvan. All things like that come back from the break. So just so you know that I haven't lost my bearings, that there's a purpose for that. Also, a number of times through the evening, given that this is the home of the great program, "Wait, wait, don't tell me," whose sound is -- whose live studio sound is just spectacular, we want to hear from you in the evening; feel pleased, to laugh, to laugh, to applaud, to express your dissatisfaction as long as it's not in an ugly way. You know, a well-placed guffaw is fine. We would -- we don't want you shouting out or anything. And -- but again, really give thought to things. And at certain times during the broadcast, during those times, probably just before I introduce myself yet again, I'm going to raise my hand, and that's an obvious signal for, "Can you please give a round of applause? " So I know that we don't even have to practice that. But in the beginning, I'm going to be introducing each of the debaters. It will be great if you could applaud each of them. My hand will be going up for that. The last thing, because we're doing a radio broadcast, is we have a lot of microphones placed all over the room. And cell phones and Blackberries, et cetera, will cause interference with them if it reaches a certain critical mass. So we're -- we're fine if you're Tweeting about this. In fact, we're delighted by that. If you're live Tweeting, fine, because we don't think there will be enough people doing that to cause problems. But if you're not using your phone for that purpose, please shut down entirely. And you don't want it ringing in the middle of the debate and then having that be heard on NPR stations across the station as you stifle your phone. So that's it. We're really, really delighted to be here and delighted that we have a full house upstairs and down. And folks upstairs, I need to tell you that our microphones for questions won't go up there. But if you make a special trip to come downstairs, and I notice, I'll try very hard to call on you to come into the debate. So we are put together -- we exist because of an organization called the Rosenkranz Foundation which started Intelligence Squared U.S. with the mission of raising the level of public discourse. And to help us now frame what this debate is, I would like to invite to the stage, to the seats out front, the chairman of the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Robert Rosenkranz. John Donvan So Bob is just going to talk to us very briefly about what's going to happen here, why we're doing this. So what's at stake basically, Bob, in this debate?
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|3|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|0|22|20|1|1|39|0|50|0|0|8|9|73|33|0|6|11|0|0|2|0|340|5|0|0|0|1|2|14|0|1|4|46|0|7|10|5|3|0|10|7|1|13|26|92|57|78|14|69|0|0|1|0|0|31|36|0|8|0|14|74|21|3|0|34|548|Well, this is one of the most intense emotional kinds of issues that we've ever debated. It raises all kinds of questions about ethics, but it also raises huge public policy questions. In our country, we're spending about 17 percent of GNP on healthcare. Other rich countries spend about 9 percent. And a big driver of that is what's spent in the last year of life. And so like 30 percent of all Medicare expenditures are in the final year of life. And this is frankly driving the huge government deficits that all of us are worried about, and it also, when it gets down to the level of the individual family, it's kind of why families in America have seen no increase in their real incomes over the last decade. All of the improvement in productivity and growth over that time has gone to healthcare. John Donvan So the side that's arguing for rationing has what going for it as its strongest argument? Well, I think the strongest argument simply is that we cannot afford to provide unlimited healthcare, particularly at the end of life, as if it were a free good. There has to be a way to bring in under control. And either governments or insurance companies have to ration end-of-life care as a policy response. John Donvan And the opposite way, the side arguing against rationing. The side arguing against would say that healthcare, particularly at the end of life, should be the subject of a discussion between your doctor and your patient and the patient's family. And the argument against is really summed up in very colorful language. No one wants death panels. John Donvan And why this debate now? Well, I think the answer is the presidential debate. This is one of the critical national issues. And I expect, because it's such an emotionally difficult issue, it is not going to be debated forthrightly in the presidential debates. So I thought this was a good opportunity to do it. John Donvan So we'll do it here. Thank you, Bob. And so that is the shape of this debate. And let's bring our debaters to the stage. John Donvan And I would just like to ask for one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making all of this possible. John Donvan Yes or no to this statement: End-of-life care, we can't afford to keep every elderly person alive, so we're going to have to ration it. Is that right, or is that wrong? Well, since probably all of us at some point want to have our crack at it, when it's our turn, but probably all of us in the meantime, we're going to have to pay for it for everybody else, and since there really are two serious sides to this argument, then let's make a debate of it. I'm John Donvan, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We are in Chicago, Chicago Ideas Week. It is a pleasure to be here. The motion that's on the table, "Ration End-of-Life Care. " We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this motion. Our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins.

His partner, Peter Singer, professor bioethics in the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. The motion, "Ration End-of-Life Care," and here to argue against the motion, Ken Connor, chairman and founder of the Center for a Just Society. And his partner, Sally Pipes, president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research Institute. Let's start off with "Ration End-of-Life Care," and let's meet our debaters. First, Dr. Arthur Kellermann. Doctor, you worked in and you taught emergency medicine for about a quarter of a century. That's the front line in this really, and I want to ask you, do you think the rest of us, we, civilians, in this world, really have any idea how often these end-of-life decisions come up in the ER?
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|5|R1|ARTHUR KELLERMANN|for|0|3|5|0|0|7|0|2|1|0|0|0|17|5|0|1|4|0|0|0|0|41|1|1|0|0|0|0|7|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|3|6|11|3|8|3|9|1|0|0|0|0|10|3|0|4|0|3|5|5|0|1|4|80|John, we save a lot more lives than we lose, but we deal with the issues we're going to debate tonight far more often than anyone realizes. John Donvan Okay, and your partner, Peter Singer. Peter is a professor of bioethics at Princeton, and you wrote in the New York Times a few years back that a system of rationing care should include measures of the quality of life but not judgments about moral character or social value. Why not?
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|6|R1|PETER SINGER|for|0|5|3|0|0|15|0|11|2|0|1|0|21|7|0|1|5|1|0|1|0|87|1|2|0|1|0|0|4|0|0|5|7|3|0|0|2|0|1|0|6|1|3|4|24|11|14|2|12|1|0|1|0|0|8|10|0|3|1|1|18|0|0|2|10|151|Well, I think that's not the business of physicians. I think they can judge. There are ways of judging quality of life and life expectancy, but moral character is something different. It's too subjective, I think. I wouldn't like to see it used as a criteria in there. John Donvan All right, Peter Singer. Our motion is this, "Ration end-of-life care," and here to argue against the motion, first, Ken Connor. Ken, you are chairman of the Center for a Just Society, and you played a major role in perhaps the most well known case that centered on end-of-life issues, the Terri Schiavo case, in which the nation and the family was divided over the question of whether to remove the feeding tube from a young woman. The governor of Florida was empowered by the law called "Terri's Law" to become involved in that. What was your involvement in that story?

John Donvan And the fact that in the end your side lost? Terri's Law, was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court, and Terry was ordered to die by starvation and dehydration. She did so over a 13-day period. If the court had ordered that of Ted Bundy, it would have been deemed to be cruel and unusual punishment, but that's precisely what it was.

You are also arguing against rationing end-of-life care, and you wrote a book called "The Top 10 Myths of American Health Care. " So what do you think is the number one myth about end-of-life care?

People should have the right to die and to live as long as they can. John Donvan All right. So we have already heard a taste of where this debate is going to go by listening, hearing all of our debaters in these brief introductions. Now, in this debate, you, our live audience here in Chicago, act as our judges. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once again after the debate, on where you stand on this motion. And the team who has moved the most of you to their side by the end of the evening, and it's as a percentage term, will be declared our winner. So let's have our preliminary vote. If you go to the keypads on your seat, you'll see a series of numbers, but you only need to pay attention to one, two, and three. We're going to ask you to push number one if you agree with the motion, "Ration end- of-life care," That's the side that this side is arguing for. If you agree at this point with this side, if you are against the motion, if you disagree with the motion, "Ration end-of- life care," push number two. And if you are undecided at this point, push number three. My guess is that the undecideds are who these debaters are really fighting for, but not necessarily. We have had a lot of debates where people said that they listened so closely that their minds are actually changed because the arguments were so good. So we're going to lock that out now. And again, at the end of the debate, we'll have you vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed most as a percentage will be declared our winner. So our motion is, "Ration End-Of-Life care. " And on to round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. They will be seven minutes each. And speaking first, for the motion, Arthur Kellermann, the Paul O'Neill co-chair and policy analyst at the RAND Corporation. Prior to this, he was a professor of emergency medicine. Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Kellermann.

Since 2010, I've worked for the RAND Corporation. RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy questions confronting our country and the world. RAND analysts are expected to be dispassionate and detached. That's not a good way to win an "Intelligence Squared" debate. So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave. And I'm here tonight not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor. Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying patients in some of our nation's busiest ERs. The goal of emergency medicine is always to save lives. But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants. It happens when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness. And that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got around to having the conversation. They never got around to talking with the patient about, "What will they want us to do when they reach that point? " So we end up having that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a family conference room or at the bedside. Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full- court press. Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, put in IV lines. But, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want. And rather than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying. That's why when "Intelligence Squared" called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what their family goes through too. Now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, I think it's important for us to define just what we mean. What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about? Medical and surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be used. Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine. Many treatments are used to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, or there was no advanced care planning. Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's simply rectifying poor-quality care. And some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low chance of success. Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would consider rationing. And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about that in a minute. But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used often enough. It's relatively inexpensive. It's highly valued by patients. And it's effective. It's palliative care. Palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they can be as they approach the last days of their lives. Now, two years ago, a group of cancer specialists published an amazing study in the "New England Journal of Medicine. " They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer. And they randomly assigned them to two treatment groups. One treatment group got palliative care and standard cancer treatment. The other group got very aggressive, advanced cancer care. And they followed the two groups. The palliative care group not only had a better quality of life and less depression prior to their death. They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment. This past August another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life. Those that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried. Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth. So at the outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad medicine. And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to advocate limiting access to palliative care. So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of situations in a highly charged question: Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long as they want? Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price. Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 percent. So the question is not whether we're going to live or die. The question is where and how we'll die and who will be with us when we do. Most of us don't want to die in an intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved ones. Yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life. As a physician, my goals are simple: To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect. That's why at the end of this evening I urge you to vote for the proposition. Thank you. John Donvan Now, arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes. She is president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research Institute. She also writes a weekly health column for forbes.com and is the author of "The Pipes Plan: The Top Ten Ways to Dismantle and Replace Obama Care. " Ladies and gentlemen, Sally Pipes.

And I am against the proposition that we should ration end-of-life care. My mother was Canadian and a senior. In July of '05, she felt she had colon cancer. Her primary care doctor said she did not because he did an X-ray and no cancer showed up. Well, we all know that colon cancer is not detected by an X-ray but by a colonoscopy. But she could not get one in Canada because of her age and the fact that a waiting list for people under 65 with colon cancer symptoms was over six months. So by late November, my mother was hemorrhaging and had lost 35 pounds. She knew she was ill, and she went to the hospital in an ambulance and went to the emergency room, spent two days in the transit lounge. Then she did get her colonoscopy. But sadly, she passed away two weeks later from metastasized colon cancer. This is the outcome when government bureaucrats set the rules for who is going to get care and when. This is rationed care and what will face seniors in America if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed and replaced. Rationing care at the end of life may be a sound solution in the abstract. But when it comes to your mother, your father or your child who has a terminal illness, it is wrong for social engineers and government bureaucrats to make these life decisions for you. In Canada where I grew up, the government spends 11.4 percent of gross domestic product on healthcare. And private health insurance is outlawed. The government sets a global budget, the one that government can afford. The demand for healthcare is much greater than the supply. As a result, Canadians spend -- and they have long waiting lists, rationed care and lack of access to the latest treatments. 17 percent of Canadians are waiting to get a primary care doctor. In 2011, 940,000 Canadians were on a waiting list waiting for treatment. The average wait in 2011 from seeing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 19 weeks, up from 18.2 weeks the year before. In the case of my own mother, it may have shortened her life, but it was definitely cheaper for the government. In the case of my mother, it may have shortened her life. But colon cancer is one of the most common diseases among our seniors. A study published in the British journal Lancet Oncology, suggests that America is one of the best countries for treating cancer and survival rates five years after diagnosis for 13 of the 16 most common cancers. Do we want to change this outcome by controlling healthcare costs through rationed care? For example breast cancer survival rates among American women is 83.5 percent, whereas in Britain, it's only 70 percent. Prostate cancer, survival rate 92 percent in the U.S., only 51 percent in Britain. So how will the Affordable Care Act ration care for our seniors and in particular those in need of healthcare? In three ways: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, accountable care organizations and the patient-centered Outcome Research Institute. First, IPAB; on October 1, President Obama and Governor Romney spent a lot of time debating the issue of IPAB. IPAB will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by the president and approved by the Senate whose job it is to cut Medicare spending. It will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on Medicare exceeds the average Consumer Price Index growth rate between 2014 and 2018. After that, costs will be tied to GDP growth plus 1 percent. The board must propose spending cuts. Congress could overrule the board, but only if it has a 3/5 majority in the Senate and the House or comes up with another plan to reduce costs. The accountable care organization is second. They are delivery models for doctors and hospitals to give them financial incentives to provide good quality coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries while keeping costs down. They would benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for treating Medicare patients. If higher, ACOs would have to pay back funds to the government. It is my belief that doctors and hospitals will ration or deny care to seniors if they feel that their costs would exceed the ceiling. ACOs are a giant HMO. Third is the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). It is similar to NICE in the UK, a government agency that determines which treatments are cost effective as compared to medically effective. While no one can deny that there are problems in American healthcare, a system that empowers doctors and patients will solve them, not the federal government. I do think that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care. How do we achieve that goal? Well, I believe there are two competing visions when it comes to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage. One focuses on doctors and patient-centered solutions. The other focuses on increasing the role of government in our healthcare system. That was President Obama's vision. Liberal politicians, academics and the elite media tell Americans that socialized assistance such as exists in Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all. And while it is true that 5 percent or 2.5 million seniors in their last year of life consume 25 percent of Medicare spending, it is still my belief it is not the government's place to limit costs by sacrificing lives. End-of-life decisions should be made by doctors and families, not bureaucrats such as those on IPAB and PCORI. They will ration the care our seniors receive, and I believe that is ethically and morally wrong. In my view, people have every right to live as long as they can. Therefore, I urge you to vote against the proposition. Thank you. John Donvan Thank you, Sally Pipes. And we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "Ration end-of-life care. " You have heard the first two opening statements, and now on to the third. Debating for the motion, "Ration end-of-life care," the Ira W.

Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|13|R2|PETER SINGER|for|11|58|28|0|0|63|1|119|4|0|15|7|221|80|4|23|29|0|0|3|0|698|20|4|3|0|2|2|84|0|2|8|97|0|16|12|23|6|0|1|22|8|22|93|142|116|199|54|112|0|4|4|0|2|123|59|0|21|13|22|179|66|0|6|67|1134|Thank you very much. It's the position of our side that we are already rationing health care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so. The question that we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we're doing, and, therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially means, "Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we're spending now," or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don't bring out in the open so we cover up, that we don't really dare to discuss. And we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the money we're spending effectively. Now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at present. We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross national product, on health care. That's about 50 percent more than other comparable countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with. There is no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we're spending, than those other countries. And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks. When we looked at not just what the health system does but at health outcomes in America, we're actually terrible. It's the combination of what the health system does and our general health. We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like Slovenia and Costa Rica. They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet their health outcomes are comparable to ours. And the other industrialized nations have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada. It's also true -- it's also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just coincidentally the same number, say, "Yes," they do. When you asked Americans, only 56 percent of them say they do. I think that there's a general feeling that this health care system is not delivering what we want. But as I said it is rationing. It rations in many ways. For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not insured at all. That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect, but it will not unfortunately drop to zero. Now, not being insured means that you are more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident. In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road accidents, seriously injured. And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for other variables than those who had insurance. And when he calculated how much it would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000. Reasonable amount of money. But that was how much more was spent on saving the lives of the others. But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about $5,500. These people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each year of life that we could have saved. Compare that with the amount that those much criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. What they say is too much to spend. Apparently, NICEs figure is around $49,000. In other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these young accident victims. And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because some people can't afford copayments. We have long waiting times. We don't pay doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don't take Medicare patients, or they don't take so many Medicare patients. So we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we could save quite cheaply. So I think we ought to be more explicit about this. We ought to be prepared to say, "Let's use the dollars --" maybe we should spend more dollars. I'm not necessarily opposed to spending more dollars. But let's use the dollars we spend in the most effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives. Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than the economy is growing. They're rising at 9.8 percent per annum. We all know the economy is not growing at anything like that amount. So as that keeps happening, what's going to happen? It will eventually soak up all available spending. But we know the government has to spend on other things. On the website, in the articles that were posted. There's a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the demographic changes, there's going to be more of them. Effectively, we need to spend a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no longer look after themselves. That costs money, and it's going to cost more money. We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important things that we need. So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care. We are arguing that, indeed, we should. That's obvious. But whether we should be more explicit about it, because we want to get the best results we can. We want to save the most number of lives that we can. And the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this motion. We should be rationing health care. Thank you. John Donvan Thank you, Pete Singer. And our final debater will be speaking against this motion. It's Ken Connor. Ken is chairman and founder of the Center for a Just Society. He is a successful trial lawyer. He represented Governor Jeb Bush in the long-running Terri Shiavo case, and for several years served as president of the Family Research Council. Ladies and gentlemen, Ken Connor.

Sally Pipes' mother's situation is exhibit "A" for why Americans don't want the government to wind up rationing health care in this country. By contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an older age than Sally's mom. She received aggressive treatment, both surgery and chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed. Which system would you prefer? Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make three points, if I may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care. First of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by bureaucrats at a remote location. Secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying. Thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way -- lazy man's attempt to balance the budget. It's easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands of the special interests at home and abroad. So back to the premises, first of all, that healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside. Americans don't want bureaucratic bean counters in Washington making decisions about what kind of care they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life. Decisions about healthcare and how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families. Decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given patient should take into account the needs of the patient. In other words, healthcare should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient. A bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of individualized decisions that are required. These are decisions that have to be based real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning as Dr. Kellermann has pointed out. And it's the people who have their feet on their floor -- on the floor in the hospital and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions. There's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine in Washington can make those kinds of decisions. Healthcare requires the fine edge of a scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax. And patients don't want their doctors straight- jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city. They want decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account. They don't some interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in Washington, in a room that was predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions. And, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in Washington to be making these kinds of decisions? Should cost be the primary driver of such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in Washington? I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort. Now, no one is suggesting for a moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources. We absolutely should be. But rationing is not what we need. It's rational care. We ought to be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient? Is it clinically appropriate? Is the cost reasonable compared to similar services? These are questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the hospital in real time by hospitalization -- hospital utilization committees and not by people who are removed from the bedside. Now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former Colorado governor Richard Lamb who said, "The elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way. " This philosophy sees the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now costs more to maintain than they produce. They reject the sanctity of life ethics that has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious and out to be respected and protected under the law. That view affirms equal protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old. Instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies. Of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability don't score well using those formulas. And isn't that the point? Ladies and gentlemen, what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of life? Will they be any more successful than they were in picking Solindra and Bright Source and Abound Solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars? But then again, what does it matter? At the end of life, we're all going to die, right? Folks, I would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying. For heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the Wall Street bailout to rescue businesses that engaged in profligate spending practices. Surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick and the dying. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the proposition because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did. Thank you. John Donvan Thank you, Ken Connor. That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. John Donvan Now we'll have the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience, we have two teams of two. Arthur Kellermann and Peter Singer are arguing for the motion: "Ration end-of-life care. " And we have heard them say basically that we already are rationing, that healthcare is rationed right now by the ability to pay for it by the individual and that it is time to be explicit, to ration in a different way, to step up and admit that's what we're doing and figure out a system for doing it. They say that you need to figure out how much saving a life produces in terms of results. You have to compare that to how the resources could be used elsewhere. The team arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes and Ken Connor, argue that rationing end- of-life care is the wrong way to balance the budget. They say that it would be falling to government bureaucrats to make intensely personal decisions, that cost should not be the driver of a decision regarding the end of life, and that they depict a future where basically the elderly will be thrown overboard. Now, I notice that the two sides do agree that cost cutting needs to happen, that costs are out of control. They do agree that ideally these decisions will be made at the bedside by doctors and their families. The question is, who ends up controlling where the money comes from. And I want to put to the side arguing in support of rationing end-of-life care, particularly to Peter Singer, this basic question: Is there a way actually to arrive at a dollar value for what a few more months of life would be worth to an elderly person versus what it would be worth to a younger person? And does that explain whether -- does that price carry over to whether a procedure is worth pursuing or not? Can you put a dollar number on these things?

I mean, healthcare economists try to do it because really what they're doing is they're comparing what you get for your money if you spend it on one thing, let's say saving young people's lives and what you get for your dollar if you spend it on something else, perhaps let's say for cancer where it can only extend life by two or three months at significant expense. And I think what they can clearly say is we get better value in some cases rather than others. We extend lives for longer for the same amount, or we extend lives for an equal amount for less money. John Donvan You said in your opening remarks that younger lives are less expensive generally speaking to save than older lives with the outcome of a longer life lived because the person's younger rather than older. Am I reading you correctly? Well, I think most of us would agree that it's a greater tragedy if a 20-year-old dies because they're in an accident and didn't have health insurance than if an 85-year-old dies. I think, you know, we would feel that people have lived most of their life, achieved most of what they're going to achieve when they die in their 80s, let's say. It's still sad, of course. I know it's sad. But it's a greater tragedy. It's worth spending more to prevent if we can save the life of somebody who still has most of their life in front of them and still has a lot of things that they can achieve. John Donvan All right. Sally Pipes I'd like your response to that in light of your saying in your opening remarks that each of us has the right to live as long as we can. Does age come into it? Do the young -- do the younger have more of a right to live as long as they can than the older?
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|17|R3|SALLY PIPES|against|6|14|25|0|0|26|0|39|8|0|12|2|90|30|2|13|9|0|1|1|0|251|5|5|0|0|8|0|26|1|1|8|29|0|5|4|4|0|0|1|3|1|25|37|54|63|73|8|34|0|0|0|0|0|61|19|0|11|7|9|73|12|2|7|23|430|No. I believe we all have the right to live as long as we can. Only when someone has died can we actually measure the cost of what the cost of keeping that person alive is. But I think that people should be able to get the best healthcare they can and not have their care rationed by government bureaucrats. But you know, we all want to live longer lives, have affordable, accessible quality care. How do we do that? Well, we have to make some changes to our health care system. I believe in empowering doctors and patients, making changes to Medicare and Medicaid, changing the tax treatment because for people who have -- John Donvan Sally, can I interrupt? But you made that point in your opening statement. And I want to kind of keep on this question that the other side has raised about -- and you were beginning on it -- on this question of older versus younger, that they're -- what they're constructing is the notion that if you save the life of a person who then lives for 50 years, that, therefore, there's more value in that than saving the life of a person who lives for two years. You get 25 more years of life out of it. And it's a mathematical calculation. And I want to know how that sits with you, that -- to take math and dollars - - and dollar figures to apply to these very sensitive issues. Well, I would say I don't think we should be using mathematics to determine this. We should give people the best opportunity to get the best care that they can, regardless of their age. I mean, if you take an issue like infant mortality, people assume and probably will say, "Well, infant mortality is much higher in the U.S. than it is in countries in Europe," but you have to compare apples with apples. You know, Americans have -- we have the best neonatal care. When the children live -- survive a lot more in this country because they have this good neonatal care, in countries in Europe, they determine that as a fetus or a newborn, if under a certain weight and a certain length, they're not counted as a live birth. So I think we don't want to put dollars and cents on this. We want to give everyone the best possible care. And how we get there is -- well, we can talk about it a little bit later. John Donvan All right. And Ken Connor, your partner.

In America, we hold to the proposition that all men are created equal. Equal protection under the law is the hallmark of American justice. And I would suggest to you that any point of view that says that a person's dignity diminishes with age or that somehow their personhood erodes as they get older is a point of view really that is a bankrupt point of view. And inevitably that point of view will endanger everyone who reaches old age or anyone who should suffer from the slings and arrows of misfortune and wind up suffering a serious illness or injury.

I'm easily confused. First of all, I want to make sure I came to the right debate tonight because I came here to debate whether -- how we approach end-of-life care. I did not -- I just want to make sure I'm at the right debate, because I'm not here to debate Solyndra, Wall Street, ObamaCare, or the presidential election. I'm just confused, but I'm southern, and we're easily confused. So second question is are we here to debate an elderly person's right to super expensive care paid for by the government versus simply very expensive care that we all agree is probably a reasonable deal, or are we here to debate whether or not poor people and other folks can get decent care versus no care, because I personally believe in the sanctity of life, but I think the sanctity of life extends beyond birth and goes all the way up and doesn't sort of kick in again the last few weeks before death. It extends throughout life for the uninsured, the poor, and working class folks, too. And they should be part of this discussion.

And the point is, we're going to use some kind of criteria to decide who lives and who dies. And for instance, if the eminent Dr. Singer were to become the rationer in chief in the next administration, what criteria would he use? Would we look at the elderly, the demented, the disabled and say that their quality of life years don't merit preserving their lives? Would we say that, as in the case of the infants that he's identified, that they are not persons whose lives are worthy of protection and preservation? Ideas have consequences. What we believe determines how we behave, and this logic applies at the end of life no less so than at the beginning. John Donvan Let's take one specific part of your question that relates most closely to this motion, to Peter. And, you know, if you were the rationer in chief --
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|29|R3|PETER SINGER|for|4|23|4|0|0|24|0|50|6|0|14|0|77|33|0|14|18|0|0|0|0|270|9|5|1|0|0|0|10|1|0|10|42|1|2|4|7|0|0|0|2|4|4|35|51|64|78|8|30|0|0|3|0|0|42|15|0|17|18|9|81|2|1|11|22|427|That's not a very likely scenario. John Donvan No, it's unlikely to happen for anyone. But do you have a system? Or do you have the outlines of a system? Do you have a philosophy about how this should be approached? I would try to look at the number of years that we can expect to extend people's lives for a given number of dollars. I would also try to look at the quality of life as well. Now, that certainly may be affected by dementia, but, in addition, especially with older people, I would hope that they would be encouraged to state their own wishes as to what should happen to them if they become demented, or if other things happen to them. John Donvan But, Peter, assuming that you're correct, that you're not going to get the job, what body do you see making the decisions? So I think, actually, although it's much criticized, I think that the U.K. model of setting up -- they have a National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Sally referred to it by its acronym, NICE. Not everybody thinks it's nice. But what they do is, they try to cost the various treatments that are out there, and they try to get expert data on how long those treatments extend life in a variety of different conditions, and they make recommendations. They're not binding, but they make recommendations to the local area health authorities throughout the United Kingdom to suggest that this treatment does give value for the money; you should be providing it. But perhaps this treatment for this specific condition is above the bar that we think reasonable, and you may consider not providing that. And the health authorities then reach those decisions. John Donvan And how often -- if you happen to know -- how often is there a recommendation not to use a particular intervention or treatment? Is it uncommon, or is it pretty common? It's relatively common that there are some treatments for some specific conditions that are considered too expensive to provide. And I think that that's going to be inevitable, because medical technology really has no limits to how much it can cost, and the drug companies can charge more. In fact, drugs are much cheaper in the United Kingdom because the manufacturers know that if they price them very high, they're not going to be recommended by NICE, whereas here they can basically charge whatever they like, and they're still going to get users. John Donvan Let's hear from your opponent Sally Pipes.

If you're, say, 68 years old and the actuaries within the National Health Service bureaucracy say, "Your life is worth $49,000. " You may have been diagnosed with a severe cancer, macular degeneration, but if the drugs to take care of this are costing more than $49,000, you are denied care in the United Kingdom. Read the British press, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, any of it. People are complaining all the time, even ex-employees at the National Health Service will say, "It's wrong that we cannot get the care we need because it may be medically effective but it's not cost-effective. " And on the issue of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, yes, drugs and medical devices are cheaper in Canada and in the U.K. and other countries in Europe. They don't develop these drugs and medical devices. The United States is the entrepreneurial capital for developing drugs and pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals cost about $1.3 billion from the idea until it gets through. These other countries -- Canada, Britain -- they free-ride off our R&D, and it is wrong. John Donvan Sally, one question for you when you were describing what the British are doing, saying no to certain procedures that are not considered cost-effective or not effective enough to justify the cost. Don't insurance companies do that all the time? Yes, insurance companies make decisions based on actuarial evidence. Would you prefer the government to making decisions about what drugs and treatments you can't, or would you prefer the private sector and insurance companies to make those decisions? I, personally, want insurance companies -- I prefer insurance companies. John Donvan Well, you know -- let's -- let's show some respect to this -- can you -- why would you prefer the private sector to do it, to the government? Because the private sector provides all things that we -- we can make decisions about what kind of cell phones we want, what kind of bank accounts we want. The private sector is always good. But the problem in this country is that 50 percent of our healthcare today is already in the hands of government through Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP and the VA system. We don't have a private market. We need to move to a three- year market, get insurance away from employers. 60 percent of Americans have their healthcare through their employer. And if they don't like the plan or whatever, you're stuck with that. But if you lose your job, you lose your insurance, you go into the private market, you have to buy your insurance with after-tax dollars. I want to see the tax code changed so that we can move to a more individualized basis on health insurance just like our car insurance, our life insurance, our long-term care insurance. This is the way America works. It's what makes America great. And we don't want to move to a Canadian style single-payer system which I think the president, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, that is their ultimate goal. John Donvan Let me ask -- We will have Medicare for all. John Donvan Let me ask your partner, Ken Connor this point. We do have smaller versions of single payer systems. We have Medicare, we have the Veterans Administration. They have to make decisions. They have to cut costs. Do they need to -- do they need to have a system of rationing in the system that exists now as opposed to -- as opposed to what you're proposing a solution which just is not the world that we're in today?

And so it's a practical matter. Whoever's making those payments, in large measure, is going to call the shots. What we advocate, though, in contrast to a central bureaucratized, central planning, decision making process is that we have consumer-driven decision making, informed by medical advice, mediated by markets. We believe that that system is a better system than the government system. We believe that that system is a better system and that those -- that's a better way to make decisions than relegating it to the people who brought us the bridge to nowhere, Solyndra, the Wall Street bailout. Now, look -- look, folks, plain and simple. There's an economic concept that our physician friend may not be aware of. It's called opportunity cost. And -- and your proposition assumes the fallacy of only two alternatives: Either we recoup the money from the sick and dying, or we don't. But my point is there are other ways to recoup the money from other areas where we are wasting money. And it's much easier to balance budgets on the back of the sick and dying than to wrench it out of the hands of the special interests in Washington. John Donvan Arthur Kellermann.

Mr. Connor -- I'm with you, brother, on the market incentive. So let me suggest a market-based solution to what we're talking about. I think there's a big difference between deciding what we as a society can afford to commit folks to get, whether it's in ICU at the end of the life or whether it's at 25 years old when you're trying to get your first job and starting a family. And let's commit to that level of financial protection and coverage that we all kind of want to buy into. If beyond that, whatever that is, whatever we as a country decide we are prepared to shoulder, you can buy it. Sally, you could buy it. If you want Avastin, and it's worth $100,000 a year to pay for it out of your pocket, and you want to use your children's inheritance, go for it. It's okay with me. But I've got a problem with you using our inheritance to buy your Avastin if we don't have the evidence that it makes a difference. So let's have a market-based solution. That's the deal today that 50 million uninsured Americans get, except they don't even get a basic level of coverage. It's all out of pocket, or it's on the charity and mercy of individual doctors and hospitals. That's a pretty lousy deal.

We're going to be adding 11 to 12 million more to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Why have these people not signed up for Medicaid? Well, I believe doctors are reimbursed 35 to 42 percent below what they get from treating private patients. So Medicaid patients find it very difficult to get a doctor. This is only going to get worse. The other point is that there are about 20 million of these people are people that are young people, like a lot of you in this audience. You're between 18 and 31. You're the young invincible. You don't want to spend $400 to $500 a month on healthcare. So you don't. You'll pay out of pocket when you need it. There are only about 9 million Americans who are chronically ill without health insurance for a period of two years or more. Those are the people that I want to take care of and that we should be taking care of. But you know, in the UK, in the country, if you decide that you want to buy Avastin because the actuaries have said your quality adjusted value of life is not worth the 80 to 90,000 a year for Avastin, you can pay out of pocket. But you are then out of the national health service. The government says you cannot get any more treatment from the government. And I feel that is not fair.

And we have universal health coverage, but we also have private insurance. It's not like Canada. You're not out of the Medicare, as we call it. You're not out of that scheme by taking out private insurance. It just gives you, if you want to do that, extra coverage for various things that you can do. So it's an option and -- John Donvan All right. I don't feel I'm doing a very good job as moderator tonight. John Donvan I'm sorry. Because I want to shape this back to what we're talking about as a tradeoff of what you get for what you pay, and are you willing to pay it, and is it wrong to deny that payment? And I -- you know, Ken Connor, you actually did put your finger on it when you said that, he who is paying the cost gets to call the tunes on this. And right now we are in a world where Medicare is taking care of an awful lot of people. And it's very expensive. We know a crisis is coming. Given where we are on that, their argument that at some point you have to say no, and let's figure out a way to say no, and let's make it fair for everybody, which is the principle of rationing, that if there's not enough of something to go around, you set up a system so that everybody gets an equal shot at it. But everybody doesn't get all of what they want. Just -- just that concept, what do you think of -- what is wrong with that? Because I know you think that it's wrong.

Let's think of it in these terms: How fair is it when you pay into something all your life, you get to the end of your life, when you really need it, you've been told that you're paying in to receive healthcare, and you get down to the point when you really need it and say -- and the government says, "Sorry, you're going to cost us too much. " Isn't there a fundamental fairness issue in that regard? No. We're going to take the money that you paid in over time, over all these years, and we're going to give it to younger people because they don't need as much of it as you do. Isn't that why we paid into it all of our lives? Isn't that -- isn't that part of fundamental fairness, is getting what you pay for? John Donvan Okay. And the question we'll put to this side out of this is that he's actually portraying what sounds like a very ugly situation. You're old, you're -- you got two years left. We got a limited amount of money. That group of kids over there, they've got all their lives in front of you. Sorry, Charlie. You're off the boat. It does sound ugly, nasty, and very hard to take. And I want you to take on that side of the argument.

John Donvan That is what we're talking about. I mean, we're talking about, again -- John Donvan No, it is -- but, Art, it's -- we are talking about having to make these hard choices and saying no to some people. Yeah, well, no, what we're saying is we want to give everybody good, decent, high- quality, evidence-based medicine and care, including and especially palliative care at the end of life. But if you want a super expensive drug or an unorthodox treatment, it costs a freaking fortune. And it is way beyond what we think as a society private insurances actuaries or the government's actuaries or the institute of medicine says is reasonable, then we should not, as a society, be obliged to go along for the ride. You should be able to pay for that out of pocket or in any other way you want to do it. That's a fundamental difference in saying, "No, you can't have it at all. " And let me remind you, we talked about wasteful spending earlier -- John Donvan But wasn't Peter describing a situation in the U.K. where they do look at specific treatments and they say, "If you want to stay in the national health, you can't have it at all"?

" And there's an awful lot of people that are getting thrown overboard every day in this country that we're not debating about tonight. No, no, it's really important. Sally told a story -- I'll just briefly tell a story. Early in my career, I saw a woman in her 30s, a mother of three, who rolled in the door with a hemorrhagic stroke, her blood vessel burst in her brain, she was neurologically devastated. We incubated her, we did everything that Sally and Ken would want. We gave her a full court all out best we could humanly do, and we could not save her life. I went to break the news to her sisters, and they told me that three weeks earlier she'd lost her job, lost her coverage, could not afford her three blood pressure medicines, and was forced to choose between groceries for her kids or medicine for herself. She chose her kids like any mother in this audience would choose, and she paid for it with her life. Her life had value. She died. We spent more money in the last three hours of a completely futile effort to save her life that could have kept her in blood pressure medicine her whole life, raised her kids, paid her taxes, contributed to our country. Those people matter, too! John Donvan I want to take questions from the audience, but I just want to finish this up. Should she have been denied that service since it didn't make sense economically? What? John Donvan The extraordinary effort -- No, because early on you don't know how things are going to turn out and you -- but at some point you say -- and, again, what we said -- opening conversation here is the most important discussion to have is between a physician and the patient with an honest sharing of information, not get pulled into an industrial complex of modern medicine. Just remember, we were talking about the Affordable Care Act or Obama Care earlier. One of the first provisions that got knocked out of it was one that would have given doctors a little money every six months to encourage them to have a conversation with their patients. And you know what we called this, folks? We called it a "death panel. " What the hell was that about?

Are you willing to be as aggressive about reforming medical malpractice and ensuring that physicians meet the standard of care for those 100,000 as you are to argue for the 1,000s who don't survive because of a lack of insurance?

Sally, you were running through how many people are uninsured who could actually receive government assistance if they applied for it. But aren't you being inconsistent, because aren't you against a single payer and yet you seem to be advocating that many of the uninsured take advantage of the programs that really are single payers?

Everyone in America is entitled to health care by turning up at an emergency room. And the real -- the hidden tax is not on the uninsured. It's on the low reimbursement rates by government to doctors and hospitals. That adds about 10 percent to the cost of an insurance plan by people who have private plans. The uninsured only adds 1 percent to the cost of premiums for those who have insurance. John Donvan Response from the other side? You dont need to if you dont want to. Art Kellermann.

Everybody is one or zero as an individual, but the odds and the outcome and the prognosis really matter, and people need to understand what they're signing up for. Ken talked earlier about cruel and unusual punishment. If we took prisoners on death row and subjected them to a week in an American ICU, the Supreme Court would rule that unconstitutional. So it's important to make your choice based on your values. And my advice to you, sir, is to go home tonight and talk to your wife and kids and tell them what you want at the end of the life, so they'll be there to represent your views.

One, we're thinking 60 years down the road, and the other being that the stereotype that Gen-Y all think theyre special is true. Which scenario do you think would be more likely? "A," as a result of our lives being so special, that the pool of end-of-life candidates would become so extreme down the road that we have no choice but to make reforms, and have this discussion and ration life care? Or "B," would -- as a result of having such a comfortable life, would the -- would the effect of the suffering that goes on during end-of-life become so extreme where the conversation actually switches to people -- do people have the capacity for -- to choose euthanasia, for example? Would there be a demand for that? John Donvan Let's take Ken Connor first on that.

So I'm going to pass on it, but thank you. Can you at least talk about the euthanasia? John Donvan Sure. All right.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|63|R3|KEN CONNOR|against|1|3|2|0|1|16|0|23|4|0|8|1|40|16|2|5|9|0|0|0|0|138|2|4|0|1|1|3|8|0|0|0|29|0|0|3|7|1|0|1|2|0|1|18|28|25|50|4|19|0|0|0|0|5|28|11|0|4|0|4|32|3|0|9|9|230|I'll be happy to address that. Historically, in America, we have maintained that humans - - you know, it's a self-evident truth that human beings are endowed by their creators with certain inalienable rights, the first of which is the right to life. That right to life has been deemed to be the foundation of all other rights because if you don't preserve it, you don't get to enjoy any of the others. Now, I fear that rationing opens the door to euthanasia because decisions are made on a utilitarian basis about who lives and who dies. And that's the reason I injected the issue on the front end of this debate about personhood. Because Dr. Singer has maintained that if you lack certain qualities, rationality, the capacity to reflect on your own existence, self-awareness, you're not a person. And he makes the point that if you're not a person, then it is not as morally culpable to destroy that entity than it otherwise would be for -- John Donvan But Ken, he's not -- he's not making that argument. Well, my point ultimately goes to this: Is that when we use these utilitarian criterion to decide who lives and who dies effectively, we wind up redefining who a person is and -- and that gives rise to a potential license to kill which invites euthanasia. John Donvan Peter Singer.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|64|R3|PETER SINGER|for|3|28|8|0|0|32|0|64|8|0|6|1|82|33|0|10|8|0|0|1|0|333|8|8|1|0|4|2|21|0|0|18|51|0|1|6|9|1|1|5|12|3|5|35|75|71|92|16|53|0|1|2|0|2|54|30|0|16|13|16|98|5|1|7|20|515|Well, if I can comment on that, I think what we are increasingly finding, and we will in the future, if you're looking to the future, is that more people want to have the right to make their own decisions about when they die, about when they've had enough. At the moment, people generally can say, "I don't want any more treatment. " But if there isn't treatment that's keeping them alive, they don't have that choice. Now the citizens of Oregon, the citizens of Washington state, have voted in favor of having that right, at least to get a physician to prescribe the medicine that they know will be lethal that can end their life. The courts in Montana have said that citizens there have that right as well. There are several nations in Europe that allow that and also allow -- some of them allow a doctor to give a lethal injection as well on the request of the patient, satisfying certain conditions like a second opinion. Those countries are satisfied with that. In the Netherlands, for example, that's been the case for at least 20 years now. And through different governments, through liberal governments, through conservative governments, through a Catholic prime minister who never tried to repeal that law because he knew it was too popular and would be political suicide if he did. So I think that that is actually something that probably is increasingly going to happen as people start to see that this is something that they want for themselves. But that's a matter of choice. That's not a matter of rationing. John Donvan I want to remind you that we are in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are debating this motion: Ration end-of-life care. Peter Singer, I had the sense that Ken Connor's point wasn't about voluntary euthanasia, and I think the question was also about a culture in which euthanasia becomes a suggestion overhanging the elderly as they become more and more in number and as they become more difficult to take care of, that this sort of -- I think the question is, will we get to a world once we open the world to explicit rationing where an old person will know that it's time to get on the ice flow and get the pushout. No, I don't believe so. I think there's still going to be the possibility of choosing, providing, of course, as you're saying, that you're not imposing a huge burden on other people by opting for something very expensive and of doubtful benefits. So there are going to be limits there. But I think otherwise people are going to be able to make their choices in accordance with their own values, and there will be some people who'll want to hang on to life as long as possible and other people who will say, life has lost whatever quality is had that I think makes it worth living, and I think it's time to go.

And living wills is an area that is expanding because if you have a living will, you can say so that when you're very ill you won't -- it's not as if you're under anesthetic or under drugs, you've actually made a decision. I know it's hard to figure out when that time will be, but I think living wills are a great way to put things down. But I think doctors and families and the person who is ill should be making these decisions. And we shouldn't be so concerned about the cost to the system because we have a lot of weight in our system right now.

The decisions about living and about voluntary euthanasia should be matters between doctors and patients. And that's why I think they're separate from decisions about costs and about when treatment is imposing so much of a burden on others and on the general health budget that it's not something that the public should be paying for. John Donvan So are we, or I, confusing euthanasia, which is a deliberate act to end life, with the withdrawal of an extraordinary measure which the patient hopes will save his or her life? Are those two different things? They are somewhat different things, certainly. Again, I think patients should have those choices, and patients might choose that they don't want life support even though that is considered sufficiently cost effective to be worth providing. But that should be a choice. John Donvan Okay. But they are different. John Donvan Ma'am, sorry. I didn't see you.

I really believe that if we focused on getting rid of bad medicine and eliminating the kind of errors in communication problems that I discussed and reinforced the sustained palliative care, that takes care of 90 percent of this issue. And the rest of it really does come down to a doctor, a patient and their family and what is meaningful and mattering to them. There may well be in a point in society where we have to say that if the other certain amount of dollar value you can pay for it yourself that Medicare or private insurance or whatever won't go past that point. But I'm never going to get between an American and their wallet. It's my wallet or your wallet I'm more concerned about in that very unusual circumstance. I just want to double back to the comment about euthanasia and say as a doctor, I'm not ready to go there. But if a patient tells me, in their terminal condition, that they don't want an oxygen mask because they want to kiss their wife, I want to let them kiss their wife. John Donvan Okay. Ken Connor.

And that was the point I tried to make in my opening statement, is that the alternative is not simply ration or not. The question is whether or not we're going to continue to waste money and then promote the need for rationing because of it. Now, the institute of medicine reports, for instance, that we spend $75 billion a year because of healthcare fraud. 190 billion in excess administrative costs. Inefficiently delivered services, $130 billion a year. Now, my point is this: It's easier to argue for balancing the budget on the backs of the old people who aren't voting and who don't have lobbyists and who don't have packs than it is to try to rest the money away from the people who are -- who are perpetuating the fraud or rendering these services inefficiently. And so I'm saying, let's not take the path of least resistance. Let's not take the lazy man's way out. Let's do what we need to do to reform wasteful spending and not -- not force ourselves into a position where we think we have to ration healthcare at the expense of the elderly.

I mean, the problem is that the financial incentives in the market system, that the opposition are defending all the way, provide incentives to do more. Here is an example. The national rate of cesarean sections is 34 percent of births. There's an outfit called Intermountain in Utah healthcare that has a cesarean rate of 20 percent. It saved $50 million by doing fewer cesarean sections. But it cost it money. It lost money by doing fewer cesarean sections, by saving the system $50 million it suffered a financial hit itself because the financial incentives are to do more and you get paid more, and you can pay -- you can build up your financial base, expand, stop, et cetera. So this is the problem with allowing this to be done through the free market. We need something that puts a lid on not just fraud but also the incentives to do more medical treatments.

I'm Peggy Lester. And I've been a nurse for 30 years in an emergency room here in town. My question for everyone on the panel is if -- you know, the profit issue of all of this is what seems to me is what the issue is. And so eventually I see it that insurance companies, if we privatize everything, insurance companies will come to a point where they're not making a profit, and that they will then begin to ration care, which they actually already do. So I would like you to speak to, I think, any time we have a health care system that depends that everybody's going to make a profit off of it, we really don't do the best thing for everybody involved. So if you could just comment on that. John Donvan Do you mind if I tweak your question slightly? Go ahead. John Donvan I don't think very much, but to ask Sally Pipes just, to your point, that ultimately, if you do go to an all private system, that private companies would have the same -- exactly the same motives to ration as anybody else, and that there would be rationing under the program that you're talking about.

Aetna and some other companies have already done that. I know that United Health is not writing individual policies in California because it's just too expensive, too much regulation. So, you know, I believe that Medicare should be there for those seniors who really need it. Medicaid should be there for those people who are at 133 percent below the poverty level. I think that Medicaid should be granted to the states so that they can make these decisions. I'm not saying the whole system should be private, but I'm saying if we can move away from employer based coverage to an individual system -- John Donvan Okay, but -- all right, but -- I have to interrupt you because I do have an internal sense of the question not being answered. John Donvan And the question was, "Won't insurance companies -- if you went to a private system, won't insurance companies end up with exactly the same need to conserve resources and we heard this woman saying for the sake of making profit, but whatever the reason is, won't they have to conserve resources and end up rationing anyway? Well, there's always going to be rationing, but the question is "Who do you want to be doing the rationing? " Do you want government to be making decisions about your care, or do you want an insurance company which doesn't -- isn't full of fraud and abuse -- As Obama said "Medicare and Medicaid, $500 billion in fraud and abuse. " If those programs are so great, why are they the programs that have all the fraud and abuse in them?

I come back to the premise that I outlined earlier. And that is that we should be able to make consumer driven decisions, informed by the medical community, mediated by markets. Now, the difference between markets and the government is that within markets you have a choice. And so if you don't like the way the insurance company is rationing your care or the circumstances that it requires for you to participate in, then you have alternatives. When you're in a one size fits all government program, you have no alternatives. You have lost your liberty in that regard. John Donvan All right. I don't feel like there is a need from a response from this side because the question was posed to this side, so I'm going to go on to another question. Sir.

So last year my father -- sorry -- my brother-in-law's father was in a car accident, had his spine severed, and was in the hospital for six months, ICU, back and forth. He actually -- I think he had bills for about $1.5 million. So with that, he was 72. I want to put out a hypothetical story. You have three gentlemen, 72 years old. One is unemployed and always has been unemployed, always been on government care. One of them is a -- let's say, somebody who's in jail. And then a third person is someone who has actually been in the system paying taxes and everything else. They get in a car accident, same thing happens. Do all three deserve, from government care, the same result? John Donvan Which side would you like to hear answer that question? Over here. John Donvan Did you follow it? If you didn't follow it, I want to say, "Neither did I. "

And so the government, arguably, has an obligation to treat everyone the same. Now, in the marketplace, it doesn't always work that way. We talk about equal opportunity, not equal outcomes. And so that's what I like about the marketplace, is that decisions can be made in the marketplace. Look, the notion that government is more qualified to make decision and to allocate resources than markets, I think, is a foolish notion. The history of the world suggests otherwise. The Soviet Union imploded on itself because its central managers were not efficient, but in the final analysis, I think we need to understand that the Constitution is a hedge against government. It's not a hedge against individuals. It's not a hedge against the markets. Bu the Constitution limits the powers of government. So if government is going to assume certain responsibilities, it's bound by the chains of the Constitution, and I think we want it that way.

And these people are 72, you said, or 71. They're obviously on Medicare, because they're seniors. And I think I'd like to ask Art, when someone turns up at an emergency room, they're on Medicare, do you ask, "Are you an ex-prisoner, or are you unemployed? " I think there's a responsibility in the emergency room to treat these people. And most doctors I know who are ER doctors have no idea whether the person is wealthy or poor or whatever. So I think that under Medicare they should be treated by Art or whomever, in the equal way.

John Donvan But you've made that before, but, so, to his specific question, the answer is yes, there are situations -- The answer is yes, and I favor rationing through markets and individuals rather than through government. John Donvan Okay. Does the other side want to respond to that . Okay. Ma'am? I'm sorry. I'm going to take two more questions, then, if it's a serious question.

John Donvan Yes. So for scarce resources, I view that there's kind of two types: One is hospitals and doctors, and the other is government capital and government money to spend. So I view them as kind of differently when I think of rationing end-of-life care. And so I'm kind of -- first in terms of from this side, I believe I kind of heard that you're in favor of rationing, you know, government spending, while not rationing hospitals and doctors for those who want to pay for it. I'm kind of -- so first I want to know, is that kind of correct? And then also for this side, do you view that, why shouldn't somebody be responsible to save up their money or pay for private insurance so that they can pay for that end-of-life care while the government can ration the government spending but not ration the doctors and the hospitals?

But there's another group that really suffers under the current system. And those are the folks who are lining the hallways and in trauma centers and ERs waiting for the ICU bed that they can't get into and are there for two or three days. The ambulances are diverted from a trauma center to a non trauma center because all the beds are full. We are not a country of unlimited money or of unlimited critical care capacity. And so my perspective, and I think my colleague's perspective, is given that we live in a finite world, we want to do the most good for the most people possible. And that should be our fundamental mission. You can call that rationing, you can call it rational use of resources. But every life has worth. And the fact that somebody got there first shouldn't be ultimately the prevailing decision. We've got to maximize the benefit and the value and the system to society -- John Donvan What's the system then, Art? Then what's the system that -- The system is, again, you have to make decisions. You work with families. You have to figure out where -- John Donvan But if it's -- does Medicare get to set up a panel to say we're going to provide this particular procedure or not because it's evidence-based medicine suggests it's not cost effective. Does Medicare get to say we're not going to do that? I think Medicare gets to say we're not going to pay for it. John Donvan That's what I mean. Yeah. I think if you say you're not going to pay for it, people will go, "Ah, never mind. " I mean, we know that. The RAND Grant has done work for 40 years that showed that if people have to put their money on the table, they tend to make more careful decisions. And that's just human nature. John Donvan Do you want to respond to that, Ken or Sally?

I mean, I -- John Donvan Ken Connor. You've made a very good point that I think is a very important point, and that is that when we don't have skin in the game, we're less likely to be good stewards of the resources available to us. And so for instance I think one way that we can promote having skin in the game in the responsible consumption of medical resources is to allow young people, for instance, to have health savings accounts with high deductible insurance policies. And they've got skin in the game. Let the government subsidize or provide tax breaks to individuals who purchase health insurance, not just to businesses. The way the current system is set up is that we tend to over consume the resources because we don't have any skin in the game. The employer is paying the bill. The government subsidizes the employer, and there's no skin off our nose. And so if we want to promote good stewardship, good stewardship, then I think we ought to -- ought to cause people to have skin in the game. And that would mean that they have a stake in their own healthcare decisions. If they do, they're less likely to over consume resources than they otherwise would be.

And in fact, Art, Rand Corporation came out with a study on HSAs for small businesses showing that that is a way to reduce costs for small business employers. And I think that it was -- they were really good results about 13 1/2 million people in this country have HSAs combined with a high deductible plan because if you have employer based coverage it is what Ken said, first dollar coverage. People have no idea what the doctor visit costs, they go more often. Consumer-driven healthcare is a terrific solution. John Donvan Okay. Ma'am, I owe you an apology. If this were the Oscars, the music would be playing. I -- I have to -- I have to stop because this concludes -- because this concludes round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. John Donvan And if you'll remember, before the arguments began, we asked all of you to vote on this motion. We're going to ask you again after you hear the closing remarks. This is their last chance to try to ease your mind. On to round three, closing statements. They are two minutes each. Our motion is this: Ration end-of-life care. And here to summarize her position against this motion, Sally Pipes, president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research Institute. Thank you, John. And you know by now I am against the proposition that end-of-life care should be rationed. The Medicare trustees have projected that the program Medicare will be bankrupt by 2024 at a cost of $1 trillion, almost double the costs today.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|98|R4|SALLY PIPES|against|1|10|15|0|0|26|0|26|1|0|8|1|47|14|2|8|11|0|0|0|0|181|3|0|0|0|0|3|8|0|0|5|20|0|0|3|7|0|0|1|5|0|14|17|49|39|44|5|41|0|0|0|1|1|26|19|0|6|4|7|50|6|1|2|24|351|One of the ways to reduce the costs of our Medicare programs is to deny end-of-life care. I believe it's morally wrong, but the position is supported by my opponent. There are 50 million seniors in this country today on Medicare. And that number is going to expand exponentially as the baby boomers retire. And I am one of the baby boomers. Doctors are already feeling the financial squeeze. They are reimbursed by government at a rate 20 percent below what they get for treating private patients. It is no wonder that 52 percent of doctors surveyed say they're limiting the access of Medicare patients to their practices. Unless reformed, this could result actually in bureaucrats setting an age limit for one's life. In order to save Medicare for those who truly need it, changes are necessary, including premium support, mean testing and raising the eligibility age from 65. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi who represents my district, if the changes suggested by Romney and Ryan are implemented, seniors will die in the streets. Well, I believe if we don't make these changes, based on the Medicare cuts seniors will die in the streets. They won't be able to get doctors or the care they need. Don Berwick when he was administrator at CMMS said, "It's not a question of whether we're rationing care or not. Will we ration it with our eyes open? " We do not want a NICE system in this country. It's not the American way where a government body determines what is cost effective rather than medically effective. America needs a healthcare system where doctors and patients make decisions about the best kind of care that is needed when their loved ones approach the end of their lives. Morally and ethically, this is the only way to proceed. I urge you to vote against rationing the end-of-life care. Thank you very much for listening. John Donvan Thank you, Sally Pipes. John Donvan And now in support of the motion, Peter Singer. He is professor of bioethics in the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|99|R4|PETER SINGER|for|4|15|16|2|0|20|1|34|2|0|8|4|49|15|0|4|6|0|0|0|0|200|2|2|2|2|0|7|12|0|0|8|23|0|1|4|3|5|0|2|10|2|10|24|55|35|52|9|30|0|2|0|0|8|31|20|0|3|2|5|50|6|0|2|20|351|We've actually reached a surprising amount of agreement in this debate because both sides agree that rationing occurs. Sally said there's always going to be rationing. Ken said we are all in agreement that rationing occurs. The question is he went on to say, is who should ration? He says he favors rationing through markets rather than government. But you should read that article that he wrote that I mentioned before on the website about the problems of the elderly because his approach from that article, all-profits nursing homes have on average 32 percent fewer nurses and 47 percent higher deficiencies than their nonprofit counterparts. This increased emphasis on profits has led to a distressing rise in neglected end of use seniors. So I have to ask, why does Ken have such confidence in the market, solving the problem of the allocation of medical resources, when he is broadly, I believe, critical of what all-profits nursing homes do to abuse seniors. We think that there has to be a better way than allowing profit maximization to determine how we are cared for. Let me just conclude by referring to the case that Sally began with, the sad case of her mother, and say that although that is a tragic case, obviously we cannot generalize from a sample of one. I spent most of my life living under single-payer systems, either in Australia or in the United Kingdom. I or rather my wife, had two of our children in the United Kingdom and one of them in Australia. I think that the quality of care that we have received in Australia has been outstanding. I've obviously had medical care in this country. I don't think that it's better than it is in Australia. And I don't think that it's even more a respectful of individual choice because Australians can insure themselves in addition to Medicare. John Donvan Peter Singer your time is up. Thank you very much. John Donvan And here to summarize his position against the motion, Ken Connor. He is founder and chairman of the Center for a Just Society.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|100|R4|KEN CONNOR|against|1|3|9|0|0|23|0|26|3|1|3|2|59|15|0|9|10|0|3|0|0|169|3|1|0|1|2|2|20|0|0|5|17|0|0|3|10|0|0|1|4|3|9|18|38|41|36|4|25|2|0|0|0|0|27|15|0|3|2|3|49|11|2|1|27|312|One of our founding fathers said, "If men were angels then we wouldnt need government. " Men are not angels and we do. Markets are not perfect. And they do need regulation. The question is "Where do we wind up striking the balance? " And I can tell you to Peters point that care in our nursing homes in America is America's dirty secret. And it's in part because a -- real estate investors pose as health care providers. And the government doesn't adequately regulate them, plain and simple. And we have a absolute scourge of preventable bedsores, and avoidable malnutrition, and dehydration, falls, and avoidable infections. But let me say this, I think it's important to understand that rationing is not required in order for the health care system to remain solvent. That assumes the fallacy of only one alternative, that either we ration or we're going to go broke. That's not true. And that's why I brought up the point earlier in the debate, which Dr. Kellermann didn't seem to understand, that there are lots of places from which we can effect savings. But it's work to effect these savings. It's hard work to wrest resources from the hands of the special interests. We should not ration. We should not balance the budget on the back of the sick and the dying. We can provide good health care for all people through and including the end of life. We need to ask good questions. We need to ask, "Are the procedures necessary? Are they clinically indicated? Is the cost reasonable? " What we need is a rational approach to end-of-life health care, not the rationing of end-of-life health care. Thank you. John Donvan Thank you, Ken Connor. And, finally, in support of the motion, Arthur Kellermann. He is the Paul O'Neill Alcoa chair in Policy Analysis at the Rand Corporation.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|101|R4|ARTHUR KELLERMANN|for|3|9|26|0|0|30|1|45|8|0|3|3|72|24|0|16|15|5|0|0|0|254|8|6|0|0|0|5|17|0|0|3|13|0|0|6|8|2|0|4|17|0|19|58|39|58|78|6|32|0|0|0|0|12|68|7|0|14|1|15|89|7|0|20|24|403|Most Western democracies have health care systems that provide you with all the care you need, whether or not you can afford it. Our health care system has evolved to provide you with all the health care you can afford, whether or not you need it. Modern American medicine is a $2.8 trillion a year industry, and it is rapidly outgrowing our economy's capacity to support it. More high tech care is not necessarily better care. Sometimes the basics, pain control, bedside attention, love, matter a lot more than the most sophisticated $100,000 medicines there are. That's why, when terminally ill patients came into my ER, I did not immediately incubate, immediately start multiple IVs, immediately do anything I didn't absolutely have to do. I stabilized the patient the best I could, I assessed the situation, and I talked to the patient. If they were able to communicate or not, I would bring the proxy -- the son, the daughter of, a brother, the spouse to the bedside. Let me tell you what happened one night as an example. I brought a daughter who had cared for her mother for 10 years to the bedside, and I said, "Your mom has severe pneumonia. She's septic. This is the third time she's been in the hospital in the last two months. We can do everything we know to do, and she will almost certainly die, but she might pull through. And the best we can hope for is she'll be the way she was a week ago when she didn't recognize you and was in the nursing home. So my question to you is not 'What do you want us to do? ' I know what you want us to do. You want us to make your mother the way she used to be. I can't do that. So I want to ask you, 'What would your mother want if she came back now and stood next to you? '" And she said, "Mama would say, 'It's time. '" As you vote tonight, I ask you to consider what kind of doctor do you want to take care of your mother, and what kind of doctor will you want to take care of you, and that should guide your vote. John Donvan Thank you, Art Kellermann. We're going to have the second vote now. So if you go to the keypads in your seat.
Ration end-of-life care|i2Debates/101012rationinghealthcare.p|102|R5|ARTHUR KELLERMANN|for|1|28|15|0|0|57|1|67|3|1|3|4|95|31|0|13|7|0|0|0|0|411|5|0|3|0|0|3|32|0|2|6|23|0|4|9|4|0|0|4|22|5|14|54|98|67|82|26|93|0|0|2|0|9|72|44|0|13|3|16|105|15|5|19|49|694|After hearing everything, we want to know where you stand, whether you have been persuaded to one side or the other. If you agree with the motion, "Ration end-of-life care," the side argued by this team, push number one. If you disagree with the motion, with this team, push number two. And if you are or became undecided, push number three. And you can ignore all of the other keys. And they will lock in pretty quickly, actually. We'll have the vote probably in about a minute and 45 seconds. And so, while we're waiting, a few things that I want to say. First of all, ma'am, if we're lucky enough to be invited back next year, you find me at the beginning of the debate. I owe you the first question. Okay? All right. And everybody else who stood up and asked questions, including the ones that we didn't get to use, it takes a lot of guts to stand up, and a lot of the questions were great, actually. I want to thank all of you for doing that. I also want to thank, despite what I would professionally consider a little bit of meandering in the middle, I think we got into some very important places in this debate where the clash was head-on. We could see the values represented by both of these sides, because he doesn't actually have to think in real time. That's a very impressive thing to see happen. It's difficult to do. I want to thank this panel for what they've brought here to this stage. It's really been a pleasure to be part of Chicago Ideas Week and to be in the city at all. You actually are a very, very lively audience, and you're going to sound great on the radio. Afterwards, after the debate, we would be delighted, of course, to have you tweet about the debate. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, and the hashtag is the same, #IQ2US. I want to thank the CIW team, in particular I want to name some people. Brad Keywell, Carrie Kennedy, and Jessica Malkin who, again, was very instrumental in getting us on this stage. Our next debate is Wednesday, October 24th. It will be held in New York City. And the motion in this date is, "The rich are taxed enough. " In support of the motion, we have Glen Hubbard, is currently dean of the Columbia Business School. He is also an economic advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His partner is Art Laffer, who is known as the father of supply side economics, the famous Laffer curve is his curve. He was a member of President Reagan's economic policy advisory board. He's debated with us before, and he's actually very -- not only smart, he's very witty. He keeps everybody laughing. Against this motion, "The rich are taxed enough," we have Robert Reich, who is former secretary of labor in the Clinton Administration and professor at the University of California in Berkeley, and Mark Zandi, who is one of the most widely followed economic forecasters and the chief economist of Moody's Analytics. So, all right. The results are being walked up. So, remember, we had you vote -- This never happens in New York. That was very generous. Our motion is, "Ration end- of-life care. " We now have the results in on your votes. Remember, we had you vote before you heard the argument and once again after hearing the arguments, and the team who has changed your numbers the most, who has moved you to their side by the largest percentage, will be declared our winners. So here is how it breaks out. Before the debate, 43 percent were for the motion, 22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided. After the debate, 38 percent are for the motion -- I'm sorry. After the debate, 81 percent are for the motion, up 38 percent; 12 percent are against it, down 10 percent; 7 percent are undecided. The side arguing for the motion carries the debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from, me, John Donvan, in Chicago, and Intelligence Squared U.S.

So let's just talk through the side now arguing for the motion, the side that wants to break up the big banks, what do they have going for them?
Break up the big banks|i2Debates/101613 big banks.p|6|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|1|10|0|0|0|14|0|19|0|0|1|1|21|11|0|4|1|0|0|0|0|110|2|0|0|0|0|0|3|0|0|3|21|0|5|2|1|0|0|2|0|0|0|7|25|19|30|5|13|0|0|0|0|0|10|9|0|3|5|1|26|2|0|0|8|175|Well, I think the first thing one needs to understand is that, what is the role of a bank? The important role of a bank in our economic system is to lend money to consumers who want to spend or to businesses who want to invest. And some of these banks are so large, about a dozen of them, that the government has designated them as too big to fail, which means that they have an implicit government guarantee. But those banks are doing so many things beyond that basic function that the argument would be that this is simply a step too far for the government to be guaranteeing all these other activities. These big banks are too complex to manage, as we see. Run well, et cetera, et cetera. They may be too opaque to regulate. And also it's an unfair competitive advantage for them to have this implicit guarantee of the government because the banks that don't find it more expensive to fund their operations, and therefore more difficult to be competitors.

Break up the big banks|i2Debates/101613 big banks.p|8|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|3|8|9|0|0|18|0|15|3|1|0|2|30|11|0|3|5|0|1|2|0|117|0|0|1|0|0|0|11|0|0|3|13|0|0|2|2|0|0|0|8|2|9|7|33|15|22|5|30|0|0|0|0|3|15|22|0|8|1|8|24|0|1|5|14|210|Well, the argument for the other side goes back to the financial crisis and said -- says, these big banks were not the cause of the financial crisis. That was Lehman Brothers. That was Bear Stearns. That was AIG. Big banks really had nothing to do with it. Moreover, the big banks are better capitalized and in much better shape now than they were then. And U.S. banks are in better shape than banks anywhere else in the world. In a global economy, you need really big banks to serve global companies and to compete with the big banks in other countries. And then finally, the question of what kind of regulation. I had a chance to ask Tim Geithner a question today about bank regulation. And he said, "You know, it's a bit like Afghanistan. You have all of these different tribes, all these uneasy exercises of power and conflict with each other. " And, of course, he's talking about the incredible complexity of financial regulation in this country. And then if you think about, out of a process like that, if you're going to hand out a meat ax to whack these big banks, the odds of getting a result that you think is good seem almost infinitesimal.

All right. Terrific. I'd like to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making this all possible. Four letters of the alphabet: T.B.T.F. ; acronymically, it's Washington and Wall Street shorthand for too big to fail. " And it's the concept that justified taxpayers having to bail out banks in trouble in the financial crisis, because the thinking goes that if one of these really big banks goes down it could take everything else in the economic system with it. Solution, how about breaking up the big banks? Drastic, right? But would that actually solve the problem? Would we be safe from the threat of TBTF if we broke up the big banks? Well, that sounds like the makings of a great debate, so let's have it. Yes or no to this statement, "Break up the big banks," a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan. We are at the Kaufman Music Center in New York City, and we are in partnership with the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law and Public Policy, a joint venture of Columbia Business School and Columbia Law School. As always, we have four superbly qualified debaters who have all lived and worked this issue, but they're coming at it from opposite sides. Two against two on the motion "Break up the big banks. " And as always we go in three rounds and then the live audience here votes to pick the winner. And only one side wins. Our motion, again, "Break up the big banks. " And now let's meet the team arguing for the motion, first, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Richard Fisher. And, Richard, you are the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, a bank that Texas Monthly profiled in which it described Dallas Fed's, quote, "long tradition of being a pain in the --" and a word beginning with "A" -- -- and how you are perhaps the most visible in a long line of dissidents from the bank. You have been often in disagreement with Fed policy. So our question to you is in the ranking of Fed policymakers, how much of a pain in the neck are you?

And this is an issue that's dear to our heart.

Ladies and gentlemen -- -- Simon Johnson. Our motion is "Break up the big banks," and we have two debaters here to argue against this motion. First, ladies and gentlemen, welcome Douglas Elliott. Doug, you are a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. You were in investment banking for 20 years, most of it at JPMorgan. At one point you left banking and started up a nonprofit, which was called the Center on Federal Financial Institutions. After that you went back to banking, back to JPMorgan in 2006, just in time for the financial crisis, which says what about timing?

" We'll be hearing a lot about it. And it simulated a bank meltdown, and you had people playing bankers and congressmen and journalists, et cetera, FDIC folks; so I really want to know was your version of Congress more functional than the one that we have now?

And those are our four debaters. Now, the way this works is that they will debate in three rounds and you, our live audience here, will choose the winner of the debate. By the time the arguments have concluded you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate your sentiment on this motion. And the teams -- the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. So, let's go to the preliminary vote. The first vote. If you go to the keypads at your seat, the way it works you push number one if you agree with the statement "Break up the Big Banks," the side that's being argued by this team. If you disagree with this statement and you're with this team arguing against the motion, push number two. And if you're undecided push number three. If you push the wrong key, just correct yourself. The system will lock in your last vote and you can ignore the other keys. Well repeat this at the end of the debate and the turnaround time from that vote to giving the results and telling you who the winner is is about two minutes.

Thank you very much. When Simon Johnson and I speak of breaking up the big banks, we're speaking of less than a dozen banks that are considered, as you mentioned, too big to fail. Let me just give you a statistic, 0.2 percent of all the banks in the United States of America control 70 percent of the banking assets of the country. One of them mentioned earlier by Bob, JPMorgan, has assets that exceed the total assets of 5,400 community banks in this country. Our definition of a bank too big to fail is a bank whose bond holders and shareholders and managers and big customers, even their oligarchs, believe themselves exempt from the rules and the consequences that apply to all others. If they screw up they'll be bailed out by you, the people in this audience, the American taxpayers. It happened in 2008, 2010. You know that. And then a law called Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress to prevent it from ever happening again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than ever. They are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that taxpayers will once again come to their rescue. The mechanics to corral them are more politicized than ever. And even worse, Dodd-Frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement. This places the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive disadvantage. They don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well- heeled, Brooklyn accented lobbyists like Paul Saltzman to work the regulators. Under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial institutions. The acronym for that is SIFIs. Now we, at the Dallas Fed and Simon and I would consider the SIFI an acronym for save if failure impending. And actually when you think about it, SIFI sounds like a communicable disease. Something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed -- Thank you. I was waiting for that response. Indeed it was the TBTF or the SIFIs who were, if not the cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008-2010. That crisis, we estimate at the Dallas Fed, cost the United States over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain. And if you do your numbers, you'll know that this is $120,000 per every American household. The SIFIs, the too big to fail, are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the American economy. They threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this broadcast. So yes, Simon Johnson and I are advocates for breaking up the big banks that are considered too big to fail. Our proposal is simple. We suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies. We will let them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from underwriting any of their other businesses. Secondly, require anybody who is counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails -- if this transaction fails, we will never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the United States. And, C, subject all those businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding companies enjoy. For example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a bond. And finally, insist on transparency. As Bob pointed out, there's not much transparency. There's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called. The CEOs of these businesses know where their risks are. If you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by looking at their balance sheet. And I would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me why what I've just suggested is an unworkable solution. And Mr. Saltzman and others are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths. One is that there is greater banking concentration in Canada than in the United States, greater concentration in France than in the United States. That's great if you like Gordon Lightfoot, or if you're French. Or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration, for example computers or telecoms, that's true. But these are companies that are not shielded from failure like banks are. They receive no subsidies from the implied guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the bankers to shield them from failure. Winston Churchill once said that in finance everything that is agreeable is unsound, and everything that is sound is disagreeable. I know that what Simon Johnson and I propose is disagreeable to the highly paid lobbyists and spokesmen of the too big to fail big banks. But it is the sound thing to do. The big banks, in summary, have taken what I call the immoral high ground. Government policy has led them there, and it has enshrined them. We need to correct this perversion of American capitalism. It may not be the French thing to do, but it's the American thing to do, and I think we should do so. So I ask you to vote yes to the proposition before this house. Let us break up the banks, the big banks that are considered too big to fail. Thank you.

Our motion is "Break up the Big Banks. " And here to speak against this motion, I'd like to introduce Paul Saltzman. He is president of the Clearing House Association, a trade group that represents 18 of the world's largest banks. Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Saltzman.

Seven years after the subprime mortgage crisis, one thing is clear. Many people made serious mistakes; public officials, regulators and, yes, Simon and Richard, large banks. Mistakes that we now know with the benefit of hindsight helped bring about the crisis. But in the three years since the passage of the Dodd Frank Financial Reform Act, there has been an intense focus on strengthening our banking system. There are new rules and supervisory practices that are changing both the culture and the structure of large banks in permanent and transformational ways to ensure that a crisis like the one we experienced never happens again. But my opponents ignore or understate these reforms. Instead, they propose a radical, untested, and practically unworkable experiment that would upend the progress we have made and create a whole host of new systemic crises. My opponents' proposal would forcibly break up the largest big banks by placing an arbitrary cap, a government imposed -- the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to the payment of our debt. This unprecedented abuse of government power attempts to address an ill-defined risk with little regard for its practical implications or its unintended consequences, simply because they think smaller banks are inherently safer. That is their underlying assumption. And they are selling you this solution as a risk-free proposition without any cost to society. Yes, we can have all the benefits of large banks, but we don't need the large banks. I'm afraid, Simon and Richard, you just can't have it both ways. Their solution is naive and nostalgic. Yes, we all yearn for a simpler world. I get it. But when America and the world become less interconnected and simpler, when large and small companies become less global and stop being the mainstay of production, consumer innovation, and choice, then let's have this debate. Look, the strengths of our banking system is its diversity. We need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions. And yes, within that mosaic, some banks are large, quite large. But some of these banks are large for a simple reason. They mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve. They are scaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services. Large banks provide a unique set of services. Global distribution channels, innovative technologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope and scale at cheaper prices for American consumers. Some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points. Some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment for our global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems. And large banks spend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure from dangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay. And some benefits are indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like the breadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operational support and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, trade finance, global cash management and other risk management tools. Look, several realities will be debated tonight, realities which I submit can't reasonably be refuted, although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so. First, we do have to put things in perspective. Some of America's banks are indeed large. But we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the world economy that we live in. The size of the American banking system is proportional to the economy that it serves. Our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basically the equivalent of South Africa's. In addition, as Richard mentioned -- I know he was appealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree of concentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries. The largest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most other industries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals and wireless telecom. Second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is that smaller banks are somehow safer and less complex. That is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history. Banking crises are caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you have what's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many people buying the same overvalued asset. And when that asset bubble bursts, you have a systemic crisis. My point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds, can be a source of systemic risk. They have been, and unfortunately, they will be. Breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis. And also, they would eliminate the stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times of inevitable crises. And third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during the course of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law that prohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates too big to fail. And there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatory reforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system. To ignore or understate these transformational changes is disingenuous. There isn't a single aspect of a bank's business that hasn't undergone -- been untouched, undergone reform or been untouched by regulatory reform. Banks have twice as much capital as they had before the crisis. Liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation. Bankruptcy road maps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and less complex. And we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved without taxpayer support. To suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong. They are in place. They are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and the impact of that failure if and when it does occur. The answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bring to our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatory framework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the next crisis is coming from.

And here's where we are, we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate. I'm John Donovan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "Break up the Big Banks. " You have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third. Arguing for the motion, "Break up the big banks," Simon Johnson. He is the Ronald A. Kurtz professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Ladies and gentlemen, Simon Johnson.

And thank you, Paul and Doug, for being willing to come out and argue the big banks' corner this evening. This debate is long overdue. Now, Richard Fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking up the big banks. And, now, you should take note of what he says. He's the president of the Dallas Fed. He's a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets. He's also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements he makes, wouldn't want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner. My job today is to tell you the things that Richard Fisher can't tell you -- -- because he's too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat. And a lot of these things are about politics, and I want to cover these precisely by responding to what Paul Saltzman has just said on three main dimensions. I want to talk about the magic -- supposed magic of banking. I want to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the world. And I want to talk about Dodd-Frank, the legislation; the miracle that Mr. Saltzman says has fixed all our problems. Now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it? Have you seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in customer service; the reduction in fees; the better access to credit for all Americans? No, no, you have not. You have not. And the really -- -- the really interesting point -- and I'm afraid the sleight of hand, and it's a masterful sleight of hand -- in what Mr. Saltzman said is the history. When did the banks in the United States become so big? It wasn't 50 years ago. It wasn't 30 years ago. It's mostly in the last 15 years. Mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the United States had total assets around 15 percent, 1-5 percent of U.S. GDP. They're now over 60 percent of GDP, combined. They're bigger now than they were before the crisis. This is a recent development. All -- everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the magic if there were any magic for you. There isn't. There's magic, all right, there's magic in compensation. If you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck. You understand what that's about. There is no magic of size for the consumer, for the broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector. Let's talk about numbers. Let's talk about -- let me talk about JPMorgan Chase. I don't see Jamie Dimon the room. He could speak for himself if he is here. We haven't -- nobody said anything about the numbers, the size. What is the balance sheet -- total balance sheet measured properly? Include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards. It's a $4 trillion bank. It's about a quarter the size of the U.S. economy. I'm comparing the balance sheet with our annual GDP. That's a big bank. If JPMorgan were on the verge of failure today, a Wednesday, it's an awkward day for banks, though -- I think one of the big lessons actually from the Clearing House simulation was "Don't fail on a Tuesday. " It's a long way from Tuesday to the weekend. We need to get to the weekend. Do the bailout. Right? It's a Wednesday. It's Wednesday, it's an awkward day, I understand. It's an awkward day. JPMorgan, $4 trillion is going down. It's a hypothetical. Please don't rush to tweet that. It's hypothetical. JPMorgan is about to fail. Who here thinks that the president, secretary to the treasury, chairman of the Federal Reserve would let them go? Let them fail? Take the hit? Go through bankruptcy? Does anyone think JPMorgan could fail just like every other business outside of big banks could fail in America? Could JPMorgan fail? Anyone want to raise their hand? Paul, you can raise your hand if you want. Anyway, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was a $1.1 trillion bank when it failed. I'm sorry, was rescued by liquidity loans. I always get those two things mixed up. In September 2008, $1.1 trillion bank. That was up from $250 billion in the mid-1990s when it was one of the best banks in the world, when it provided really good service to individuals and corporate customers. One of the best banks in the world. It became a lot bigger. It became $1.1 trillion. Anyone think Goldman Sachs could fail. No. I see no hands. One hand. Good luck to you, sir. There is a short seller in every New York audience. Dodd-Frank, Mr. Saltzman says, Dodd-Frank has solved this problem. Now, I'm a supporter of Dodd-Frank. I think this is important legislation. We had to get some of those reforms done. I worked to help the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with their implementation of some of the plans for how you manage the collapse of these banks. Yes, I'm a member of the systemic advisory committee for the FDIC. It's a great, fun job. I can assure you. We have terrific parties. And, you know, maybe, maybe it'll work. Maybe the single point of entry, the recapitalization of the holding company, maybe they'll be enough capital. Maybe the Federal Reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on everyone who lost a job. Eight million jobs lost, $15 trillion in output. Dennis Kelleher from Better Markets in the second row has the same numbers from his independent assessment. This is a calamity. Maybe we could avert that danger. Maybe Dodd-Frank will work and all these pieces will come together. I would not bet on that. I do not advise you to bet on it. I advise you not to take risk out of the world. You can't do that. We have no magic bullets. There are no panaceas, but as a matter of responsible action, as a matter of dealing with the problems that confront you, as a matter of reducing the risks that we will face, I urge you today support the motion put forward by Richard Fisher and me, "Break up the Big Banks. " Thank you very much.

And that's our motion: "Break up the Big Banks," and here is our final debater speaking against the motion, Douglas Elliott. Doug Elliott is a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former investment banker. Ladies and gentleman, Doug Elliott.

Thank you, John, and thank you all for being here. I have to deviate slightly from my prepared notes here, from the sleight of hand comment. My -- the sleight of hand I noticed is they seem to either not be making the same proposal or they seem not to be clear on what the proposal is. My understanding was this was about breaking up the big banks, which I think most of us here, certainly Paul and I assumed, was to break them into pieces, many pieces, not -- to bring them down below a certain size level, not to do what sounds like a variant of Glass-Steagall. Simon himself didn't describe what he thinks should be done. He described what he doesn't like about the current situation. I'm sure later they'll have a chance to explain what they actually mean and if they both mean the same thing. Taking this the way I think we were supposed to, I strongly believe it would be a big mistake to forcibly break up the largest American banks. I oppose breaking them up for three main reasons. First, as Paul has pointed out, we need some very large complex banks in America to cost effectively help our businesses and families deal with a large, complex world. Without them, loans and other services will be more expensive and harder to get. Second, breaking up the big banks is unlikely to make us safer, despite the assertions of Richard and Simon. Third, the process of breaking the banks up would almost certainly cut bank lending for a number of years at a time when our economy needs more lending, not less. Starting with the role of big banks, I think Paul explained quite well. What we need in America is an ecosystem of finance in which there are many different types of organizations that are thriving; big banks, small banks, insurance companies, many other types of participants. Among those I submit that we do need some very large banks, primarily to serve our largest companies, and even middle sized companies, that need a very wide range of financial services, need them in many locations, including overseas, and need them to be provided at a scale that allows it to be cost effective so they're not excessively priced. This means, when you add this up, we do need some that are quite large. And I would think if they have a criterion, would cross the criterion that they -- my opponents would feel -- meant they should be broken up. And this isn't just my opinion. The Business Roundtable did a survey of CEOs of major U.S. companies, and they very strongly supported the need for banks of this nature. Now, Richard has his Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, which does some nice research for him. But I'm sorry, Richard, I happen to be more impressed by research papers from two other Federal Reserve banks in St. Louis and in Philadelphia, that have shown quite considerable benefits of this kind of size and scope to quite large levels, that these provide many benefits to society to allow the services to be provided at a reasonable cost without which loans and other services would become more expensive. I also wouldn't want to see us tie our hands in international competition. Now, let me go to my point on no increase in safety, because I don't actually believe that what they're describing would make us safer, even though perhaps in that Churchillian approach, it sounds agreeable to do this, to break up the big banks -- we all seem to hate bankers -- but it's not actually the right way to go. Now, think about why it -- what would be different. Let's say ten years ago, if we had broken up the big banks into 20 pieces each, I don't think much would have been different in the crisis that we had. It would have been severe, it would have happened, and the character wouldn't have been that much different, because these smaller banks that they were broken up into would all have gone the same way, that is, they all would have overinvested in mortgages, both residential and commercial. Now, why do I say that? One, because at the time, almost everybody thought this was smart business. So almost all the players in the financial sector were doing it. Secondly, you can look at what small and medium sized banks did. The ones who actually existed that are supposed by safer, they took on tremendous risk and got hurt quite badly. They were just smaller, so they didn't, each one of them, make the headlines. Smaller size was no protection from risky and ultimately stupid decisions. Richard and Simon imply that smaller banks will take less risk. I don't see it. I don't see it from the incentive structure, and I don't see it from how they actually operated. Put another way, breaking up the big banks would not have affected any of the principal factors that analysts tend to argue caused the financial crisis. They wouldn't have affected excessive investment in all types of mortgages, reduced standards for those mortgages, government pressure and encouragement to make risky mortgage loans, lacks regulation, poor practices at the rating agencies, a bad bonus culture, excessive risk taking by some individuals and the incentives that existed to create dodgy securitizations. So I don't see why we'd expect it to be safer. Now, you might say, well, we wouldn't have to do a rescue as taxpayers if these were smaller banks. But we saw, in the savings and loan crisis -- -- that we had to do that. If I had more time, I would talk more about this. But you may be surprised that Paul Krugman, no friend of the banks, agrees with us. He said, "Breaking up big banks wouldn't really solve our problems, because it's perfectly possible to have a financial crisis that mainly takes the form of a run on smaller banks. " In fact, that's precisely what happened in the 1930s. And if I had more time, I'd give you the rest of the quote. I can do that later if you want. But let me move on to the conclusion here. Keep in mind, Richard and Simon are selling you a theory. We have no actual experience of breaking up the big banks in this way in advanced economies. They cannot promise success. And I personally believe it will do considerable harm. The economy will be less efficient, credit more expensive. We'll be less competitive globally, and I don't see an increase in overall safety. Thank you.

" Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because as I said before, we're going to have you vote again at the end of the evening to tell us where you stand on this motion after hearing the arguments. And the team that has changed the most minds in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Now onto round two. And round two is where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me.

" Arguing for breaking up the big banks, Richard Fisher and Simon Johnson who are arguing that we're in uncharted territory in terms of the size of the small number of banks that control the assets of an enormous amounts of money that they didn't have 15 years ago; that the government protections that allow them to operate without fear of failure, without bailout represents a moral hazard; the fact that they are shielded from failure is a moral hazard that needs to be remedied. The team arguing against the motion, Doug Elliott and Paul Saltzman argue that the bigness of the banks is not the key issue here, that in the financial crisis we all went through a few years ago, there were many, many factors involved. And big banks, while they made mistakes, were only part of that problem, that breaking up the banks, these big banks would be a dangerous and unworkable experiment, and that basically big business needs big banks. And if we want to be global, we have to have banks that are global as well. I want to go to the team that's arguing against the motion to come back to this term, too big to fail," which your opponents embrace. That's, in fact, the core of their argument is that there are banks that are too big to fail, and failure would be catastrophic. I just want clarity from the side arguing against the motion. Do you believe that there are banks that are too big to fail, whose failure would indeed be catastrophic? Paul Saltzman.

So let me just be very clear from the outset. No bank should be too big to fail. No company should be too big to fail. Companies, whether they be banks or other financial institutions, need to suffer the risks of their own risky behavior. It's as simple as that.

And what he says is, Well, we don't quite have the British piece in place yet. I actually think that to American English the answer's no.

What the British are doing as I think you know is actually very similar to what we still have under the parts of Glass-Steagall that we never got rid of, which is there are protections under current U.S. law that mean that deposit taking banks have a number of transactions they cannot do with their non- bank -- their securities affiliates.

Why are we a couple of years away? Well, Dodd-Frank passed in 2010. Three years later, how much of it has been implemented? Relatively little. Why? Because there's been a huge pushback from the industry. Now, Paul and his colleagues are completely within their constitutional rights. I'm not complaining about it. I'm merely pointing out that there is an enormously powerful lobby, particularly around these very large banks that has resisted Dodd-Frank. It's resisted the living wills that Paul mentioned. It's resisted implementing a lot of other measures that would curtail the range of activities and the power of these very large banks. That's why we haven't made progress and were not a couple of years away -- we're decades away --

I represent the Clearing House. We have been nothing but constructive in the Dodd-Frank debate. We have supported living wills. We have supported higher capital charges. We have supported prescriptive liquidity rules. We have supported the vast array of macro-prudential rules. We have spent millions of dollars through simulations and otherwise to try and create a framework in which too big to fail ends. We are in agreement. We don't want subsidies. We don't want moral hazard risk. The disagreement is the proposition on the table is you guys are in favor of the proposition to break up the big banks. This is not about Glass-Steagall, and Richard, your proposal is very reasonable and tomorrow if you want to have a debate about your proposal, let's do that. But that's not what's here tonight. What's here tonight is a proposal on the table for the government, the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to anything in Washington. You want them to set arbitrary size limits and break up the big banks. I think that is preposterous.

The proposal that has been made achieves exactly that. So it does achieve the purpose of this debate. All these banks that you acknowledge are too big to fail, you believe that this massive legislation, over 13,000 pages of rules that have been promoted, some 24 plus million hours, for man and women hours, every year to try to discern, interpret and put in place solves the problem of too big to fail. I don't believe it does so. I think it enshrines too big to fail. And I believe, most importantly, it places the smaller banks, who wish to grow and wish to compete and provide services and have a fair chance to compete, on an un-level playing field. I think what we should all propose is that we go for any bank that is too big to fail, make it too small to save. Exactly what the small banks -- you were saying that the small banks take the same kinds of risks. You're right. You know what happens if they fail? They're shut on a Friday, and they re-open on Monday with a new ownership, and the management is gone, fired, gotten rid of. I just want the same thing for the large banks. That's all I ask.

We lost not only 600 plus small banks, but the sixth, seventh and eighth largest banks in America. They were closed quickly. They were shuttered. Isn't it interesting -- no offense to New York -- that Texas is now the most prosperous state in America? And we did it without too big to fail banks. And in fact, we closed the banks that then were considered too big to fail. And Paul Volcker was the master of that closure process.

I have one more topic that I want to bring to the debaters. But I just want to remind you that you'll raise your hand. Folks, if you're upstairs, I can't see you, and there are no mics up there, so you'll have to come down and stand on the steps. If you raise your hand, a mic will come to you. I'll ask you to hold it about that distance from your mouth so that the radio broadcast can hear you clearly. We ask you to state your name. If you're with a news organization, we'd appreciate it if you would identify yourself as such. And as that's getting set up, I just want to take one more question to the side that's arguing for breaking up the big banks, an argument that your opponents made, that -- that global business demands global banks and that there are businesses that rely very much on the banks now that are massive in scope, that they serve a function, that they became big in part because of the needs of their clients. And I just want to ask Simon Johnson to take on that point, and then we'll hear a response from your opponents.

As I said, Goldman Sachs was a substantial international bank, one of the best international banks in the world in the mid-1990s. It was less than a quarter of the size that it became at the height of the financial crisis. So that's exactly what we mean when we say, take away the subsidies, break up the banks; the market will sort out the ones who should fail, the ones who should survive. Without those subsidies, John, they will be substantially smaller, and they'll be more competitive globally. You really want big, mega-crazy banks like the Europeans have? I don't think so.

That's the problem with the proposal. No one has a monopoly on understanding what the right size is. Banks are appropriately sized for the needs of their customers. FedEx, Amazon, Apple, Google. Verizon just merged with Vodaphone, $130 billion merger. We need these global banks to service the community that they operate in, which for better or for worse is global and interconnected. So I think, which is it? If it's 250 billion, is it 500 billion? Is it 1 trillion? That's the problem. The size of these banks are determined by the marketplace.

When we refer to mega-banks, we're just differentiating the size of the banks in the country. When we refer to breaking up the banks, we're talking about banks that are too big to fail. And we're talking about basically 11 banks that are presently covered by that status. Systemically important financial institutions. Some have a simpler book, some have a more complex book. But I think it's kind of an artificial argument. Yes, determines a mega-bank, but it doesn't mean it may be too big to fail. The banks that are too big to fail, so complicated, so large, that even their own managers have trouble understanding the scale and scope of those operations. That's what we're addressing here this evening.

And a question for each side. For the opponents, you've mentioned the consolidation of the rest of American industry. And you said the banks are consolidating in the same way. Couldn't it be the causation goes the other way, that the immense over-consolidation of the banking industry has caused the rest of the economy to follow in its wake and it's raised the brittleness of the U.S. economy, decreased job formation, made middle market lending harder to achieve and harder to get because the big banks are indeed so big.

Societies don't mirror banks. Banks serve customer needs. Google is not large. IBM doesn't have businesses in 170 countries because JPMorgan exists. So I would say it's exactly the other way. Businesses becoming global -- small businesses are becoming global, and banks service their needs. The other concept I'd like to get on the table is economies of size, scope and scale. If you pay a million dollars for a computer, and you have one customer, you have to charge that person a million dollars. If you have a million customers, you get to charge that person a dollar. It's pretty simple. Over the past five years, you have enormous technology expenses that need to get spread out over a large customer base. That is in large part why banks are getting larger and larger, because of those global and technology needs.

It's a fair question. And they say, no, we don't. What we want is different providers in different places. The idea we would single-source all of our credit, all of our financial transactions, that's actually a bad idea. We want to have different people, and we want to be able to pick and choose depending on who has a good price -- who has better customer service in a particular market. So the idea that the big or international business somehow needs colossal at this scale international banks is a complete fallacy.

And I will in one second. The only reason we've been so focused on the other point is that is the actual point of the debate. And it's kind of a sleight of hand to say, "We think that once you do this thing, it will change the whole economics so much that we know that it will achieve the same effect. " I understand there's an argument for it that's far from proof. But coming back to your question, I happen to oppose re-imposing something like the full version of Glass- Steagall -- I know Paul does as well -- because the world has changed immensely. Glass- Steagall didn't even work 20-some years ago because already by that point the principal difference that Glass- Steagall focused on, the difference between a security and a loan had become extremely unclear and irrelevant because the bank -- the big companies that we're talking about here, all they wanted was to efficiently get credit. And they wanted to be able to do that through the markets, and they wanted to be able to do it through the banks. And banks are important parts of the market as well. So they sit in the middle where they can help with either side of this. To arbitrarily break it up -- first of all, it will be really arbitrary. I don't even know how you define a loan versus a security now. It just -- you can't do it in this world. If you do, it'll be a very arbitrary choice.

It's funny that Eric Holders' name just came up, because he also said before Congress that the size of the banks was problematic in terms of prosecuting them. He then took it back because it had kind of slipped out and he didn't want to admit to that, but -- -- he did say that. Do you find that troubling?

Yes I do. No bank, no individual, no company should be too big to put in jail if they've violated the law, okay? That's point number one. Number two, have you read the newspapers lately? Okay? Do you think banks aren't being prosecuted every day and probably for political reasons? Eleven billion dollars of fines being suggested for activity that occurred prior to the acquisition of the companies that the government suggested they acquire? So this notion that somehow banks are immune from prosecution is just simply not true. No bank should be too big to jail. No one who has violated the law should be immune. That's my position, and I would assume it's the position of the other debaters around this table.

Look, it's a very uncomfortable statement about American society and the American legal system, but honestly, that is where we are today. These banks are too big to prosecute effectively.

Because the market would then gravitate to those with the most efficient delivery of services and all the services these gentlemen speak of rather than just assuming that they can conduct business with them because they're totally safe at all times. Only the most efficient would survive. That's what the American capitalist system is all about. If you're not efficient you should fail. If you're efficient you should succeed and grow. So, to me -- -- that's what we're talking about here. We're talking about taking away the fence of protection, that -- you dont yet, but your parents as taxpayers, unless you're a very successful young debater -- -- provide, just taking away all those guarantees and just saying you have to stand up on your own legs just like anybody else to compete efficiently. And, by the way, it may be that XYZ Bank competes better than everybody else and has that business. That's fine with me, but I do not want to risk another penny of taxpayer money to bail them out when they make a big mistake, and I think that's exactly what will happen, and it will happen in bigger size and it will happen again and it may well, if things go poorly, happen before the waiting period that this gentleman mentioned.

Hi. I'm Jen Pachichi , I work at DPCC . I have a question for Richard and Simon. So you're saying that these banks are all global in nature. And you're proposing to break up the U.S. banks. But how would you handle international banks like Barclays who have both commercial, retail, and investment banking divisions? How would they operate in America?

And if not, they will dominate the world. You are a young woman. You probably are too young to remember. That was an argument made that the Japanese banks were to dominate the world, Nomura, et cetera. Or that French banks would dominate the world. It hasn't happened. It doesn't happen because they grow to such a size and scale that they're unmanageable. I don't fear international competition. I want to just be the best at what we do. I want to make sure that our taxpayers are protected so that we don't get driven into the tank like we were before. And I do believe that we can be internationally competitive just by being outstanding. But we've had these fears before. These are protectionist fears. And by the way, they're nonsensical.

I think I agree with Mr. Fisher's proposal. I don't know if the means you choose will achieve that end. I think the two biggest protections are the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve. Shouldn't we be talking about breaking up the biggest public bank and their role in subsidizing the large banks that we have?

I'm a senior at Yeshiva University, an accounting student, just came to watch the debate. I had a question for Richard and Simon. And we've mentioned several times the complexities of these large banks, specifically JPMorgan, 4 trillion in assets, 80 trillion in these incredibly risky derivative swaps. In a sense, yeah, you're right, these are incredibly risky things that are so colossal. How would it -- I mean, somebody asked about the economy. But you're suggesting breaking all of this up? Who exactly do you think it is that's going to pick up the pieces and make this all function in a smoother way? Take first shot?

And particularly with the subsidies of -- behind the derivative book, for example, we are proposing to remove those subsidies. And we believe, because this is what we see around the rest of the American economy, that when you operate without the subsidies, you get efficiency, people who are not very good at running a business go out of business. Other people enter and take over. So that's the dynamic of American capitalism. All we want for banking and for the operation of these financial markets is what we have in the rest of the American economy. Why should JPMorgan and the people who run it be exempt from the way the rest of the American economy operates? What makes them so special, so different? Is it your point that they have become particularly dangerous because of the business they operate? You may be right that they are particularly dangerous. Then I think it's even more pressing issue of public policy.

Let me give you an example. There are huge hedge funds that manage derivatives. With each increase in the risk position they take, they have to post greater margin. That does not occur at the XYZ banking institution you mentioned before. Why should they be different than -- why should they have different rules apply to them that are applied to everybody else in the industry? So, yes, it's a huge derivative book. And, by the way, it's also a question of how the derivatives are balanced in terms of risk. It could be 40-40. They could offset each other or they could have their own capital at risk. When you place your own capital at risk and the number is less than 80 trillion -- I don't know what it is, "X" -- you should be subject to the same rules as anybody else who takes an at risk position. That's all we're advocating. And I'm sure and I know there are others that would take up those positions that were sound and replace the positions that that institution will have, but that's because they're better and more efficient operators and they don't operate with a subsidy.

You're throwing out the term "subsidy" and creating this argument as if it's the agricultural industry that gets taxpayer dollars. What you're talking about, just to put it in the context, is allegations or assertions that banks -- somehow large banks borrow at funds cheaper than would otherwise be the case because of market perceptions that they will be bailed out

Secondly, evidence suggests that large institutions borrow at cheaper funds because they're larger, they issue more debt, they have liquidity premiums; more analysts cover them. Coca-Cola borrows more cheaply than RC Cola. Would you suggest breaking up Coca-Cola or calling that a subsidy?

And to my friends on my left, how are you going to make sure that the broken up pieces of all of these companies which are going to break up are not going to grow so large as to become threats to, you know, too big to fail again? Are we going to play whack-a-mole with these people forever?

" I have no problem with growth. I have no problem with size, per se. What I have a problem with is when it's subsidized by the American taxpayer. If AT&T were to fail today or if Verizon were to fail today we wouldn't bail them out with taxpayer money. We'd let them go. We'd say, "To hell with them. " That's not what we do with too big to fail banks. In fact we have enshrined through Dodd-Frank in my opinion this infinite, constant, permanent subsidization of the protection using taxpayer money. I don't care what the law says. I'm telling you how it works. And the way it works, and the way it has worked, and we've seen an example of it, so we had an implicit assumption they would be bailed out, and then we had an explicit confirmation they would be bailed out by the American taxpayer.

We have it already. I'm not exactly quite sure what you're looking for, Richard. The fact of the matter is the law prohibits taxpayer bailouts. No one wants a subsidy. No one wants firms to be artificially fueled by unfair advantage. We're in agreement as to the goal. The gentleman raised an excellent point. The fact of the matter is most companies with large fixed expenses like banks grow large for a reason. They can only be profitable because what they do requires size, scope, and scale.

First of all, here you're talking about one specific example. Every bank's going to have strengths and weaknesses. I don't think that the big strength of the banks we're talking about is their retail business, and it wouldn't surprise me if there are times when they don't have the great advantage there. Where I see the more compelling case is where you're talking about doing things that smaller banks just really can't do, period. The international trade, I'm not sure I could answer that. I'm sure there are people who would argue they do a nice job. I don't know enough about it.

And I'm going off script a little bit to basically say there's an awful lot we do agree with. There's an awful lot of the objectives that we do agree with. We just have different ways of getting there, but I know you've heard a lot of facts and figures and contradictory assertions, but let me ask you to just consider three simple practical facts. I ask you to remember that America needs global banks, and it reflects the global economy in which we live. Unlike any era before, we live in a global economy. It's clear that our economy requires these international banks to support customers. The only question is whether America will sit on the sidelines or be part of that. Today, just four of the world's largest 25 banks are American banks. To break them up and reduce that number to zero jeopardizes America's leadership in the world and America's global leadership. We need solutions that move the financial system forward, not backward. I ask that you keep in mind that we can't roll back the clock. I know it's natural after the kind of disaster that we faced and the turmoil that we've all experienced to yearn for simpler, less complex times, but the American economy that was once served exclusively by small banks just no longer exists. The good old days weren't that good. The S&L crisis, the Great Depression, all were caused by systemic risks associated with smaller banks. Rolling back the clock to restructure the banking system isn't realistic, and it simply wouldn't make us safer. I ask you to support Dodd-Frank, the macro-prudential reforms that are making it less likely for banks to fail. In closing, I know it feels good, but I submit that breaking up the big banks would create a host of new problems and solve almost none. We can do better and we should. Please vote no and oppose the proposition. Thank you.

I would submit that America needs competition. I would submit that America needs a level playing field. I would submit that America never again wants to expose its taxpayers to bailing out institutions that made bad decisions, because they were badly managed and they were encouraged basically to achieve a size and scale under the protection of the law. I therefore strongly endorse taking action that would cordon off the guarantees we provide to these mega financial institutions and just make them subject to the same competitive rules that affect all other businesses. I ask you to support our motion to break up the too big to fail banks. Thank you.

This is an important question. Let me repeat what Paul said. The overall objectives you've described, Richard, and I think Simon, we would agree with. I focus on two points why I don't agree with your actual proposal. First is I'm still a little unclear exactly what it is and how it relates to the actual thing we were supposed to debate, and for me that's an important point, but beyond that -- -- beyond that, I do believe that from the years of experience I had working in the industry that the customers really have seen major advantages. A lot of the growth has been customer driven, and I do want to say, Richard, early on you were describing bankers who were deliberately creating excessively large firms for the sake of being excessively large, opaque firms for the sake of maximizing the subsidies. I worked in M&A in finance working with financial institutions. I never once in the 20 years ever talked to anybody who, even in private conversations, had any of those things as their objectives. Now I can understand if you want to make the argument that the incentive structure pushes things that way, but I would strongly urge backing away from language that both of you at times have used that argues that the bankers are deliberately trying to create their firms in such a way that they get these subsidies. I think I'll leave it there. I'd urge you to vote against the motion.

A very large railroad company in the northwest part of the United States. It was one of the first actions of its kind. It was extremely controversial. A lot of people in the mainstream didn't know what Roosevelt was doing. There were plenty of arguments made that these monopolies were modern, they were efficient. They would benefit the American economy. J.P. Morgan, the original J.P. Morgan, the man, came to the White House in February 1902. And he said to Roosevelt and to his attorney general, "If we've done anything wrong, send your man to see my man, and we'll fix it up. " And Roosevelt and his attorney general, thank goodness, said no. We don't want to fix it up. We want to stop it. This, in Roosevelt's mind, was an excessive concentration of power. It was dangerous to the democracy. They took that case all the way to the Supreme Court. They won it 4 to 3. And out of that came a lot more precedents, antitrust cases, more legislation and, I would submit, the really important change was a shift in the consensus, people like you in New York in 1902 didn't know what Roosevelt was doing or why it made sense. They thought, many of them, it'd be bad for business. In 1911, when the government moved to break up Standard Oil, there were very few defenders of huge monopolies. People understood concentrated power can be very damaging in this democracy. Vote for the democracy. Vote to break up the big banks. Thank you.

We're asking you again to go to the key pads at your seat that will register your vote. We're going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously. Press number one if you are for the motion, press number two if you are against the motion, and press number three if remain or became undecided. And again, we're going to lock that out in a second, and then we are about two minutes away from having the results. A few things I want to take care of. First of all, some news headlines, as we've been debating, the Senate has passed a measure to end the shutdown and to raise the debt limit. President Obama began speaking on television five minutes ago, but nobody leaves. And the House is expected to follow suit tonight. I also want to say this about this debate. It was really terrific. These debaters obviously feel passionate about this. They have a shared common ground, but they have very, very honest disagreements that were honestly argued. And I want to congratulate for the way they did this tonight. I also again want to thank the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business Law and Public Policy for being our partner in this. We love having them onboard, and they've been extremely helpful. So thank you to them as well. And the last thing I want to say is, sometimes I said at the beginning, the questions can be pretty dodgy. But tonight's questions were terrific. And I want to congratulate every -- we didn't throw one out. Everybody got in. And I want to congratulate everybody who has the guts to get up and do it because it's a scary thing to do. So thank you for that. We would love it if you would tweet about this debate. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US. And the hash tag tonight is #BigBanks. Our next debate here at the Kaufman will be on Wednesday, October 30th. Our motion is, "Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. " arguing in support of this motion, Bryan Caplan. He's an economist. He's a leading proponent of open borders, which he describes as the efficient, egalitarian, libertarian, utilitarian way to double the world GDP. His partner is Vivek Wadhwa. He's an academic and entrepreneur who has debated with us before. He's been named one of the 40 most influential minds in tech by Time magazine. Arguing against this motion, Kathleen Newland. She is cofounder of the Migration Policy Institute where she studies the relationship between migration and development. Her partner is Ron Unz, a former businessman and political activist, publisher of the American Conservative for six years. Tickets to that debate are available at our website, www.iq2us.org. This Friday, in two days, October 18th, we're having an intelligent lunch. We'll be in California debating the motion which is, "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. " You can -- yeah. Where are we? You can watch the live stream of this debate at noon here on the East Coast. And it's 9:00 a.m. on the West Coast. And for those who can't get to that live audience, and if you want to get on the plane, you're welcome. There are a lot of other ways to catch these debates. You can watch the live stream on our site, iq2us.org or fora.tv. And as I said before, listen to these debates on NPR stations across the nation. And you can also download the podcast. And we're, of course, on Twitter and Facebook. And we welcome your feedback and topic ideas. And speaking of ideas, we had put out a little bit of a note to people on our website asking them to please reconfigure the letters TBTF. What else could it stand for? We said we would read a couple of them that were kind of nice. So the two that I like, a guy named John in Brooklyn, New York, said he has advice for the secret service, TBTF, "Trust but then frisk. " And Marcella Rosen, also of New York, I just like it too much, "Too beautiful to forget. " All right. The results are in now. Our motion is this: Break up the Big Banks. We have had you vote twice, both before the debate and once again after the debate. Remember, the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Here was the result of the preliminary vote on the motion, "Break up the Big Banks. " Before the debate, 37 percent of you agreed with this motion. 19 percent were against. 44 percent were undecided. So those are the first results. Remember, the team that moves the numbers the most from first vote to second is declared our winner. Here is then the second vote. The team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 49 percent, from 37 percent to 49 percent. That is an increase of 12 percentage points. That is the number to beat. The team against the motion, and their first vote was 19 percent. Their second vote, 39 percent. That's 20 percentage points above. They did it. The team arguing against the motion has won this debate, "Break up the big banks. " They have defeated that motion, "Break up the big banks. " Congratulations to them, and thank you from me, John Donovan and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

So Bob, very briefly, for those who dont know yet, Intelligence Squared U.S., why you brought it here?
For a better future, live in a red state|i2Debates/101813 red state.p|2|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|0|6|0|0|0|9|0|7|0|0|0|1|18|4|0|2|2|0|0|0|0|46|1|0|1|0|0|0|8|0|0|2|3|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|4|1|0|3|12|4|6|2|16|0|0|0|0|0|5|11|0|1|1|4|11|1|1|0|3|90|Well, I thought the meta problem we have here in the American policy world is excessive polarization. The public discourse in this country really needed a form where people could listen to ideas that they disagree with, have to confront facts that might be inconvenient, and Robert Rosenkranz Upper East -- Upper West side of New York at a time when -- just before Obama came into Office. And Karl Rove was one of the panelists, and actually a majority of the undecided voters voted with the Karl Rove side.

And Karl Rove began that evening -- he took a beat and he said Well the Upper West side of New York. Its great to be among friends. And the audience fell down and he kind of had them listening after that, and he made very compelling arguments.

So quite a surprising result, and this debate took place at a time when Al Gore was assuring us that the debate is over.

Robert Rosenkranz Well todays motion -- I really want to call a lot of attention to the language. It was pretty deliberate. For a better future, live in a red state. So it's not merely about which model of state governance is most in accordance with your policy preferences or predilections. It's really about where you choose to live. And I mean I know countless people whose policy predilections would be blue state, but who choose to live in red states. And that dichotomy between how you vote with your mouth and how you vote with your feet is part of what should encourage people in the audience here to think twice. All right, everyone. So you're going to have the chance to think twice as we welcome our debaters to the stage. Thank you, Bob Rosenkranz, and let's give them a round of applause. Robert Rosenkranz Thank you. So as we move forward from this point, we'll be recording for the radio broadcast, and because of that I'll be doing certain things like telling you over and over again that my name is John Donovan and what our motion is that's to help in the radio broadcast as they come and go from breaks. So just that you know that I haven't lost it. And the other thing is there will be points where I'll actually literally ask for your applause to happen spontaneously, and -- for example, when I introduce each of the debaters in a moment, but I'll encourage that applause by doing one of these. It, again, would help with the radio broadcast and, as I said before, communicates to the audience that you're all here. And I'd like to start that by asking for a round of applause one more time for Robert Rosenkranz for bringing all this here. Somewhere over the rainbow skies are red, reflecting back the warm glow of happiness of the red states that lie beneath them across the U.S. South and up through the west and the Midwest. Those states that seem to be close to reaching certain American conservative ideals of governance, states where taxes are lower, regulations are lighter, unions are weaker, frackers are freer, and gun rights are a given. What's not to love about life in a red state? Unless you are a blue state type. The red state/blue state divide. It's a little bit artificial. It's a little bit oversimplified, but we know what we mean when we use the term. So let's have it out right now. Yes or no to this statement: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State," a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donovan. I am proud to be here with the Philanthropy Roundtable as our partner. We have four superbly qualified debaters, Americans all, but they are divided on his motion. Two against two, they will argue for and against it: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State.

Stephen, you are also arguing for the motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. You're a member of the editorial board and a senior economics writer for the Wall Street Journal. Steve, you are based in Virginia, a state that actually went for President Obama in 2012, but we're going to call it a red state. It has a Republican governor, a Republican majority House, the Senate with the Republican tie-breaking vote. So, question to you is if you were forced to leave Virginia and had to move to a blue state, which one would it be?

Gray Davis, the 37th Governor of California, you have also served as lieutenant governor, state controller, state assemblyman, you have spent most of your life in California. Your family moved here from New York when you were a kid, you went to Stanford, but Im going to ask you the same question that I asked Steve, if you had to move out of your comfort zone into a red state, which one would it be?

And Michael, you are also arguing against the motion for a better future to live in a red state, it means youre arguing for the blue states. You are co-founder of the New America Foundation, you are also policy director of its Economic Growth Program and Next Social Contract Initiative. You are a fifth generation native of Texas, and you have already said that when its all over, youre going to go back there to retire, but being a blue state kind of guy, I just want to know why would you do that to yourself?

Thank you, here they are our four debaters. Now this is a contest, its a contest of ideas and there will only be one winner because you our live audience will be given the task of choosing the side that has argued the best. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards, where you stand on this motion: for a better future live in a red state. And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. So lets go to our preliminary vote, go to the key pads at your seat, and I will remind you how it works. If you are at this point disposed to agree with this side, the side thats arguing for the red states, the side thats arguing, for a better future to live in a red state, you push number one. If youre with this side, the side arguing against the motion, which means that they are for the blue states in this argument, push number two. If youre undecided, which is a perfectly honorable and reasonable position to be in, push number three and you can ignore all of the other keys. And if you push the wrong one just correct your vote and it will record your last vote. And it will lock out in about 10 seconds. Okay, so and how it will work at the end, well have the second vote and it takes about two minutes to tabulate the results.

Its wonderful to get out of Washington D.C., which I call Americans only work free drug zone and lately actually it has been a work free drug zone -- So let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a better life you should move to a red state and I would start with one observation, which is that over the last 20 years weve seen in America the biggest shift in wealth in the history of this country. Weve also seen a massive change in population of where people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in this country and where its not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years theres been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth and income have moved from one state to another on that. This according to Travis Brown who has written a great book about how money walks, and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states and they are moving to red states. Now some of this of course is due to things like weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging society and are moving to states like Florida, and Georgia, and North Carolina and South Carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here. But its happening all over this country. Not just moving to better weather states. In fact if you look at the statistics, an amazing statistic about California -- and I agree with Gray Davis, what a wonderful state this is -- how do you screw it up so much? You know how does the state get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful paradise? Over the last five years one million jobs, roughly -- these arent exact numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in California, and over that same time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of Texas. Thats an amazing statistic. You want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic power its leaving California, its going to Texas. Now I would submit to you that people are not leaving places like Los Angeles and San Diego to go to Houston for the weather. Theyre not doing that, right? Theyre moving there because thats where the opportunity is, thats where the jobs are. Thats where the kind of free enterprise systems flourish. And by the way just to continue with this Texas-California comparison, because I think well make this a lot throughout the debate because Texas is a prototypical red state, and California is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is California is not 40 percent higher than it is in Texas, which is amazing. People are always bad mouthing Texas, Oh they dont even have plumbing in Texas and so on, the truth is Texas is actually getting very rich, California not so much so. Second point to make that you should all ponder. We are all living through, right now, what I call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country perhaps anytime since the civil war. And what youre seeing -- to put it very simply if you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer. And there is absolutely no question about it. If you look at whats happened, for example, in the Southern states every election for the last four or five election cycles they get more and more Republican, for better or worse, and thats also true of the blue states. I hail from the state of Illinois; I love the Chicago area; I love the State of Illinois. What has happened in Illinois over the last 25 years is one of the great tragedies of our country. Illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single area. It has huge unfunded liabilities. High unemployment rate, the dingbats in Springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent. One of my favorite kinds of modern politicians Mitch Daniels, a couple years ago when he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of Illinois, and just put it so well he said To be a neighboring state of Illinois in Indiana is like living down the street from the Simpsons. I thought that is a great way to put it. And so we are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and its a tragedy by the way. And then you ask the question Why are people moving from blue states to red states? And I would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are moving. The two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research, are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to join a union or not, those states are flourishing. And one of the fun things about working at the Wall Street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies, they always tell us when theyre talking about setting up a new plant or a new warehouse the first question they ask about a state where theyre going to locate is is it a right to work state? Because it its not a right to work state its simply, they just take it off the list. No matter how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if youre not a right to work state youre just not in the game to get these new enterprises. By the way people are always talking about America losing its auto industry, and auto jobs. You know Americas not losing its auto jobs, its just the auto jobs arent in states like Ohio and Michigan anymore. The auto jobs are now in the South, right? And thats partly because of the fact that those are right to work states. The second factor that matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes. And we find this to be highly predictable for where people move. And so for example in this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax. States like Texas, states like Florida, states like Tennessee, states like Wyoming, states like Nevada, states like Washington. Those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have --

Yeah. In fairness to Stephen, the reason that happened is that -- right. Our timers were blown out when the power shortage happened, and he couldn't see where he was going. So you actually got about six minutes and 23 seconds, because I did let you go on a little long. Are they functioning now? Because if they go out again, I would just want to ask our debaters if they fail, would you like a one-minute warning from me if these timers fail? I can do that for you. Okay. But right now it looks like they've just come back again. Our motion is: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State," and our next debater against the motion is Gray Davis, the 37th governor of California. He is currently of counsel a Loeb and Loeb, LLP, and a senior fellow at the UCLA School of Public Affairs. Ladies and gentleman, Gray Davis.
For a better future, live in a red state|i2Debates/101813 red state.p|32|R2|GRAY DAVIS|against|6|15|11|0|0|26|0|43|0|0|2|5|60|20|0|3|8|0|0|0|0|263|1|0|0|0|0|3|20|0|0|9|27|0|0|11|3|0|0|7|5|12|11|33|65|54|64|19|65|0|0|12|0|1|39|38|0|4|6|3|64|7|1|15|31|479|Thank you, John. Bob Rosenkranz, thank you. Intelligence Squared, thank you so much for hosting this. And I want to welcome my esteemed colleagues both for and against this proposition. As Steve indicated, this red state/blue state deal is really not so much about geography as it is about a state of mind. And those of us in the blue states have a different idea about economic development. We believe John Kennedy had it right when he said, "A rising tide will lift all boats," because we try and provide economic opportunity for everybody, and we do that with four simple ideas. One, invest in education. Invest in infrastructure. Protect the environment and have a stable safety net. We think that all makes economic sense. We think it is morally the right thing to do. And the numbers prove that we are right. If you look at the top 10 states by average income, nine, nine are blue, one is red. If you look at the top 10 states by gross domestic product, eight are blue, two are red. If you look at the bottom 10 states by gross domestic product, nine are red, one is blue. Beyond just economics, if you live in a blue state you're going to live longer, you're going to be healthier, you're probably going to have a college degree, and you're going to have more opportunity. Now, let me talk a little bit about California, which is definitely a blue state, but was not before 1992. But today it is really a blue state. Despite what our critics say, these are indisputable facts. California has more Fortune 500 companies headquartered than any other state, 54. California is the leading manufacturing state by far in America, both by jobs and total dollar output; in 2011, $230 billion. California is the largest agricultural state in America by dollar output. California created more jobs last year than Texas, and more jobs in the last year than anyone in the nation. Most importantly, people believe in California and they invest their dollars. California gets more direct investment from other countries than any other state. And this is the statistic that's going to blow your mind. On venture capital, that's people putting their money in start-ups, in 2011, the last year we have statistics for, California got more venture capital than all the other 49 states put together, and it got more money from foreign countries investing in California. So, people are putting their money where they think they can get the best return and they believe that best return is in California. My point is, to live well, to be healthy, to have more opportunity, to be better educated, you want to live in a blue state. Vote no on the proposition that someone has to force you to move to a red state to live well.

Thank you, Bob, for sponsoring Intelligence Squared. I love the format. Thanks to the Philanthropy Roundtable for hosting us today and to my colleagues, both the wrong and right -- Its good to have you here, I have both the disadvantage and advantage today, my disadvantage is that Im a talk show host and that means five days a week, three hours a day, 15 segments a day, 75 segments a week I do this. Six minutes is an extended commercial break, its not a segment. My advantage, however, is I have a book coming out on the very last day of this year called The Happiest Life and I have spent the last year immersed in the details of the emerging science of happiness, begun 15 years ago by my colleague Dennis Prager with the book Happiness Is A Serious Problem and now most recently by Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, in his book the Road to Freedom, happiness is quantifiable. You can figure out what makes people happy and what makes people happy is more to be found in the red states then the blue states. Now I present that to you in a way that I think many of you will know or be familiar, because many of you share in common with me a friend, Dr. Jack Templeton. Jack likes thought experiments, right? Youve been in those thought experiments with Jack where you reframe the question. Heres how Im going to reframe it for you, if your son and daughter approaches you and says Mom, Dad, my company, the government, the military, has come to me and said Im getting moved one more time. Theyre in their 20s. And theyre going to drop me into a blue state or a red state, I get to pick blue or red. I dont get to pick the city, I dont get to pick the state, I dont get to pick rural or urban, I dont get to pick suburban or where in that state, I just get to pick blue or red, what do you think? Its kind of a Rawlsian construct, right? You dont know where theyre going to end up just red or blue. Four reasons to say to him son or daughter, red. Number one, when you get there, youre going to want to buy a house, California is 200 percent above the median cost in the average house in America. California is below that median. New York is 150 percent. Highest mortgage debt is in California, highest mortgage debt is in the District of Columbia. You want your child to be able to buy a house and begin that American dream, send them to a red state. Number two, youre going to want them to have kids, right? You want to be grandparents. Everybody wants to be a grandparent, I just became a grandparent; its a great thing. Guess where the fertility is? Guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most fertile states are red. The 10 least fertile states are blue. I want to read that blue list to you, because it really is blue, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, theyre going to way of Russia and Spain, they will not be there in 10 years because theyre not any children. But more importantly -- actually thats just an indication of other things. Volunteerism is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving. As you will know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red. Now of course we got Utah and Idaho and weve got the Mormon tide to drive them that way but the other seven are not. They are, however--whats that an indication of? Religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious belief. Red state advantage huge on charitable giving. Number three though when you get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, theyre going to have to drive around a lot, theyre going to have actual practical things to think about in the course of their lives. Number one, think about the number of times youve pulled into a gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state decision, theyre going to pull into a gas station. Its a good proxy for the practical cost of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that, proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states. Red states are energy productive. When I was talking to Steven beforehand and he said you take the economics and Ill take the social stuff. We didnt really say where energy would fit, I thought maybe he would talk about energy production, but then I began to think its really proxy for the willingness to go and grow with what youve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of yours are going to need to be educated. Whos doing the best? Now Michael Lind is a very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not make sense, thats what they do from that side. But you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat this one from the national education assessment study. The most underprivileged kids when it comes to education are African Americans and Latinos. The most important manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle. The most important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight. That is the turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and possibility of those children. In the NEAS, the state that is now number two that has made the most progress over the last decade is Texas for blacks and for Latinos, they have rocketed up. Do you know what state is number 49? This one. Why is that? Its because education, innovation is occurring in the red states. Why is that? Because they are not in the death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective. Thats why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and you could not guarantee that theyre going to a private but they are going to go into a public school. You would pick a red state. If you were a grandma or grandpa who wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education arena. Now as I warn you again, Michael will come up and bring up SAT scores or ACT scores, and I will give him that, theyre higher in the blue states. Youve got some legacy investments in the blue state. Youve got some wonderful cultural advantages. You might be thinking I want my grandchild to live in San Francisco. No you dont get to pick that. This is Rawlsian. Theyre just going to go red or blue. And if you really want to think that through youre going to pick red every single time. Thank you.

The motion is For a better future, live in a red state. As a native Texan I would love to endorse this motion. Texas does indeed lead California and much of the rest of the country in a number of indices. Its number on when it comes to barbeque. Its much better than that pork based stuff they have eastwards. Its number six when it comes to housing affordability, and I suspect this will come up again and again and again. Because one of the issues among us is the relative importance of housing affordability as opposed to personal income taxes and business taxes in explaining migration. So thats the good news. Heres the bad news for the state of Texas, and why it is not indeed surpassing California, New York, and other leading blue states, and probably will not do so within my lifetime: Texas is number one in uninsured adults. It is number 50 in high school graduates. I defer to Hugh on the rapid progress of African Americans and Latinos in Texas. Thats coming from a very, very low base, lets face it. When it comes to uninsured children, Texas is number two. We heard a lot about fertility in Texas, and thats true in the south and southwest in general, for ethnic and religious reasons. Texas on a scale from one to 50 is number 49 when it comes to prenatal care for pregnant women. So yes more women are pregnant, but they get absolutely abysmal prenatal care compared to most of the blue states. Just a couple more points on what Stephen raised. He said that $2 trillion has moved across state lines in the last 20 years. Well the average GDP in the U.S. annually is 14 or 15 trillion if Im not mistaken, so by my off the envelope calculations, thats less than one percent of GDP over the last 20 years. This is not a terribly strong argument for their side if you ask me. The amount of migration from Texas -- from California to Texas is also very easy to exaggerate. Texans move to California just as Californians move to Texas. Between July of 2011 and July of 2012 a grand total of 22,000 more Californians moved to Texas than Texas moved the other way. The number was 17,000 surplus for Texas and New York. Were talking about less than 0.01 percent of the US population in every case. What is more, the lower your income, the less likely -- the more likely you are to move from California to Texas. Now why is this important? It undercuts the thesis that high progressive income taxes are driving out Californians. Because if that were true you would expect to see an exodus of rich Californians. What youre seeing instead is an exodus of working class and lower middle class Californians and we know why. There are two factors. Theres the push factor, which was the housing bubble in California. It took place almost exclusively in blue states, mainly because rich people, after the tech bubble bottomed out, were looking for new and safe assets. And they had more confidence in the economic future of property assets going up in places like California, in New York, in Florida than they did in Texas and the south. So by dramatically raising the cost of living in the blue states that did force out a lot of working class people. Often -- not to the south and Texas and the Great Plains, but to states neighboring. For example a lot of the working class people who have moved for housing affordability, have gone to other blue states like Oregon and Washington on the west coast. Theyre just cheaper than California. And you see a similar spill over affect elsewhere. The poll factor that is creating so many of these jobs in Texas is the energy industry. And if you look at the red states in general, where this is taking place. It's in this energy corridor where thanks to fracking from the Bakken shale up in the Dakotas all the way down to Texas to the Eagle Ford shale, you see a tremendous explosion of energy. It lowers energy prices. It helps manufacturing, all of that. That is an accident of geography plus regulatory and technological factors. If the blue states who have energy resources like California and New York, were actually to, with some environmental safeguards to emulate these red states, you would see enormous amounts of wealth pouring into the blue states on top of their advantages. So, we agree on many things. One of the things we agree on is that the south in particular has been gaining population ever since World War II, thanks mainly to air conditioning and to retirement -- that will continue indefinitely. The basic question, I think, is not which states are picking up the most people or the most footloose corporations, but where are you most likely to have health care, to have decent education, to graduate from high school, and to have quality of life if you're an ordinary high school educated working American? And in that case I think the answer is clear. You would rather be in a blue state than a red state. Thank you.

Now on to round two. That's where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. We have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. Hugh Hewitt and Stephen Moore are arguing for the red states. They argue that we already see the evidence that the American population is making this decision with its feet, because of the big shift in population since World War II, but more recently and increasingly, a large shift in wealth going to the red states. They say the reasons people are moving, they're moving for the right to work. They are moving attracted by lower income taxes, by the ability to buy homes, that there are indicators like fertility, which is on a rampage in the red states, and that all in all the message is the dynamic is moving very much in the favor of the red states. The team arguing against them, Gray Davis and Michael Lind, argue by bringing forth a set of statistics that show us a snapshot of all sorts of advantages already accruing to residents of blue states. Blue states have higher average income. People in blue states are living longer. They are more likely to have a college degree, and to be healthier, and they dispute the notion that people are moving to the red states for benefits, such as lower income taxes. Texas and the southern states, you just heard, offer air conditioning, and that may be what's drawing people more than the lower taxes, because the portion of the population that's moving to these states wouldn't actually be benefiting from lower taxes, because they're just not paid enough. So I want to take a question to the side that's arguing against the motion for the blue states. This is a tricky debate, because both sides are coming at us with dueling statistics and it's a fairly easy thing to pick and choose, but as I did just point out, you presented, Gray Davis and Michael Lind arguing for the blue states, a snapshot of several ways in which already if you're in a blue state you're better off for various reasons, but your opponents, I think, are arguing about a dynamic as opposed to a snapshot. They're arguing that everything you say may be true, but that the trend is going in the direction of the red states. And I want to ask you, Michael Lind, to take that on.
For a better future, live in a red state|i2Debates/101813 red state.p|39|R3|MICHAEL LIND|against|3|11|12|0|0|25|0|26|0|0|2|1|33|14|0|2|9|0|0|1|0|143|2|0|0|0|0|0|5|0|0|1|17|0|8|2|1|0|0|2|6|1|6|7|33|21|25|6|35|0|0|1|0|0|11|14|0|9|0|13|31|3|7|2|12|244|Yeah, two points about the trend. First of all, the question before the audience is not whether it will be better to live in a red state 30 or 40 or 50 years from now as a result of present trends, but right now. The second aspect is, what we're really talking about is the southern model versus the northern model. That is, the Great Plains have nine million people. The county of Los Angeles has nine million people. This is largely certain Midwestern states and the south. The low wage, low public service, low tax southern model, including states like Texas, that's been the model since before World War I. A hundred years ago there was a big achievement gap on all of these same statistics between the southern states and the northern states, the so-called blue states. There is still a big achievement gap. It's been closed somewhat by growth of the south, partly because of federal investment and desegregation in the last century, but -- so that's -- I would turn it into a question to them, what date are we talking about? Because if it's 2013, you get a different answer to the question than in 2035. For you to believe that another 100 years of low wage, low tax smoke stack chasing luring companies from other states, which Mississippi has been doing for a century, is going to do any better than it has done in the last century.

This is a core tenant of economics, which is you dont have to ask us, you know, which is a better state to live in? You dont have to take Hughs word for it or my word for it or Governor Daviss for it, just look at where people are moving. If you were right, people would be moving to the blue states, but they are not and you may be right that you have all these wonderful things in blue states that make them a wonderful place to live, but you know what? People dont want to live in those states anymore, youre seeing for every one person thats moving to the states that youre defending, four people are moving to the states --

You have the best weather, beautiful mountains, beautiful beaches, beautiful women, I mean whats not to like about this state? But the truth is, you know, its getting screwed up and people have been leaving; businesses have been leaving. You go to Nevada, you go to places like Reno, I mean Reno is -- you know this Governor, Reno is filled with businesses that used to be in California, you talk to the business owners and it breaks my heart, I had to leave a third generation California business because I cant operate there anymore and I think thats really --

We are witnessing the rise again of the South. There is no question about it, and in fact if you want to go to a place where the future is happening, you dont go to Detroit, you dont go to Albany, you dont go to New York City, you dont go to Los Angeles; you go to places in the South and its very likely that in my opinion in 10 years -- in 10 years time because of the huge growth of no income tax states, the entire South within 10 to 12 years will be a no income tax region. Now how in the world -- how in the world are the North going to compete against that?

First of all, people vote with their feet, all the panelists here live in a blue state. Even Steves tenuous connection with Virginia, I would argue Obamacare in Virginia, theyve got two democratic senators and New York and D.C. are blue. California has 38 million people almost as many people as Texas and New York combined, thats 38 million people voting to be here. Secondly, the future, California is the future. Do you have an iPhone? Do you use Google search? Google is 14 years old and the iPhone is maybe 10 years old. Twitter, six, Facebook, six or seven. We have great technology companies, because in this state we take a different view towards the future. In the east where I was born after youre educated you want to join a company; in California, you want to start a company. So when I gave the commencement address at Columbia Law School, my alma mater, I got a nice note from the dean that said Would you look at my speech for the incoming first year of students? Great speech, last sentence, My six year old daughter -- the dean says, thinks Mr. Google is infallible. My only suggestion to change was, tell those first year students that Google is only three years older than your daughter, and those students are going to see breath taking change, most of which is going to come out of Massachusetts and California.

Does that impress you?
For a better future, live in a red state|i2Debates/101813 red state.p|49|R3|HUGH HEWITT|for|4|13|7|0|0|20|0|25|1|1|7|4|45|16|0|5|9|0|1|0|0|146|4|0|0|1|0|3|10|0|1|6|20|0|0|3|8|0|0|2|5|1|7|11|34|27|35|3|23|0|0|0|0|3|15|14|0|3|2|6|39|0|2|3|9|243|No, because trajectory is all that matters here. Not static snapshots, in fact, the Governor and Michael remind me of Steelers fans, just wait until the 70s, theyre always ready for the 70s to come back. And to argue these statistics, youve got to project forward, and were not just doing statistics. I would point out for the purposes of the debate, Michael conceded the most important statistic which is homeownership, the affordability index for families, he also attempted to make the argument, I wanted to point it out so that the audience contest it that he doesnt really think that matters. Ive never met a young couple for whom the acquisition of their first home did not matter. Texas is making that happen for people. The one statistic that Im going to hope Steve responds to, because I actually dont know how to respond to it, that the Governor has on his favor is that venture capital is flowing in. I believe thats because information workers here are not unionized and they do not have to worry about the right to work, the advantage of the South, so that they go and do Google and the center of gravity will be up there. On the other hand I think that creates hyper-wealthy super classes, not the sort of people that you want -- that will benefit from ta thriving middle class such as you would find in Texas and the energy states.

But the point is the one time once in a century housing asset bubble that took place in the blue states, in Britain, in Spain, and the various parts of the world, that greatly inflated the cost of living in the blue states for macroeconomic reasons, which had nothing to do with policy one way or another. As the housing sector deleverages, youre going to see a decline in relative housing, not in point tower neighborhood, you know, not in the most desirable part of California, not in Central Park West, but in other blue states. So what you seem to be suggesting is Yes well accept these other legacy features of which are detrimental in the blue states -- I mean the red states, worse educational outcomes, worse health outcomes and all of that, but you get bigger houses. If thats going to be your argument that is a tragic trade off, where you have to trade cheaper housing for worse health care and worse education. You shouldnt have to trade that.

That in fact things are moving in the right direction very rapidly, and that in the blue states the reverse is happening. Now thats a compelling argument.

They cherry picked one statistic. If you look at graduation rates, for example, in terms of education. The number of blue states with percentage of adults 25-34 with a college degree, the top are Massachusetts, North Dakota, a red state with energy, Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire, California, Iowa, etc. Only North Dakota is a red state. Of the bottom 10 there are only two blue states in the bottom 10.

I mean how do you explain the abysmal schools in Detroit, in Chicago, poverty in New York, in Boston, I mean the inner city -- and this is really I think one of the fundamental flaws of their argument. If the blue model worked then Detroit wouldnt be bankrupt right? Because there are no republicans in Detroit. It is a city that for 50 years has been ruled only by liberal Democrats. And one of the things I had warned you of is that if you want to move to these blue states, you know, one of the things that they have in those blue states that we havent even mentioned yet, is gargantuan unfunded liabilities in their pension. You want to talk about the legacy cost, look at the legacy cost of these blue states. So if you were to move from a red state to a blue state, you are basically condemning yourself and your kids to have to pay a huge amount of your taxes just to pay for the cost of the last 20 or 30 years for retired public workers where you get nothing in return for your tax dollars.

And I give my opponents credit for pointing out some modest increases in performance in Texas and other states, but in California 33 percent of the residents have a college degree, in Texas 25 percent. Talking about the future, the future is being invented in Silicon Valley, it is not being invented in the southern states, in the plain states, and its because of great research universities. Alan Greenspan told me You have something no other state has. 13 research universities. Cal Tech, Stanford, SC, 10 UC campuses. Those states create whole new economies. Invest in those states. I raise the research and credit from nine to 13 percent, and to 20 percent if you use the universities. That is why theres just a bubbling cauldron of academic innovation marrying up with venture capitalist and entrepreneurs that keep California current and at the leading edge.

And the inability to change is because there are super majorities in the state legislature and this occurs in New York and in Massachusetts and other doomed blue states to bankruptcy.

I am a defender of the interests of the ordinary people of the red states who are overwhelmingly working class and poor. What we have heard from Stephen is that if you are a wealthy enough person to be concerned about progressive income taxation, it's better to live in a red state. If you're a business whose business model is not based on R&D and it's also not a locally-based thing like Starbucks that has to be done there, but it's a footloose business that depends on nonunion labor, like labor-intensive chicken plucking, for example, in that case you'd be better off in a southern red state than in a northern or western blue state. I agree. That's why Arkansas leads the world in labor-intensive chicken plucking. But that is not your typical 21st century business.

The governor has come out in favor of fracking done responsibly, so has Obama, this is a great opportunity to rid of ourselves of dependence on the Middle East and whether youre Republican or Democrat, you should be for responsible exploitation of our natural gas and oil resources and thats what were doing in California, but I do want to make this point: that why do so many people live in blue states? Are they all misguided? Are they all getting it wrong? Theyve lived there because they have more opportunity, they make more money, theyre healthier, and they enjoy their lives more. Do we have high taxes and regulation? Yes, but the outcomes are positive otherwise people would move so a margin -- a little .9 -- .009 percent people moving here, moving there are just white noise. The fact is blue states are the makers, red states are the takers. Almost every red state in America gets more than 100 -- no, I dont mean that in a negative sense, I mean that in the sense of Romney, because Romney was talking about who takes, who makes the blue states produce GDP, the red states get more money back from the federal government than they send to Washington. For example, Texas ranks 11th in money back from the federal government, California, 32nd. We make it on our own.

So I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, your opponents have now depicted the red states as states that depend on one industry, energy, which if it were gone would blow up the whole thing and that its depending on a sort of flow of federal dollars that come more into the red states and the red states the other way. So theyve taken two reasons that the red state vision youre depicting is a little bit of a fantasy or is running on fumes -- without both of those things itd be a different world. Id just like you to respond to those points.

Theyre there, theyre fixed and they will be there for a very long period of time. Its like saying California greatest advantage, which is its coast, its extraordinary coast, its harbors, its ability to tap into the Pacific Rim which they have not damaged. In fact Governor Davis did quite a lot to advance international trade, thats its natural advantage and they use that. They do not use their energy but I dont think we can penalize states that use their energy resources and Ill also say this, the states which are technically blue but operationally red, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and my home state of Ohio are in fact going to become red over the next 30 to 40 years, which are a time frame that I think were talking about the future, we think of our children, our grandchildren. I think you look out there and you see that they become energy producing states. Their governors are adopting free market enterprise solutions, and that they will be the future because theyre going red not blue and those under class that you worry about Michael, rightly, are going to have greater opportunities to advance under what Arthur Brooks put forward as earned success but youre saying --

Theres no recovery at all -- Im exaggerating a little bit but about 90 percent of the growth of the U.S. economy is due to the oil and gas sector, and by the way thats under a president who hate fossil fuels. I mean the ultimate irony of this president is he will have presided over the biggest oil and gas boom in the history of this country. So how can you take the oil and gas boom out? I mean one other quick thing, you know, in New York, weve been talking about a lot of California -- in New York, Governor, they did actually pass a ban on fracking. And you know what, the Marcella shale goes into New York, upstate New York in places like Syracuse and places like Rochester that really need those jobs. So in Pennsylvania what theyre doing is the drilling down, theyre going horizontally --

We will continue to disagree about whether absence, the -- geographic accident of energy resources in your state border, the traditional southern low wage, low tax, low investment model is going to lead to prosperity or another century of Southern stagnation.

All the rating agencies have upgraded California. Jerry Browns got a lot of credit for taking a $26 billion deficit -- I created about $10 billion and it got worse in between -- and eliminated that through $11 billion worth of cuts, economic recovery, and the $6 billion temporary tax that the people voted on themselves. So hes gotten high marks for getting us out of the mess. He will keep us out of the mess, because there is no more frugal a man. When I was his chief of staff, I came into his office, I said By the way this hole in your rug is a little unseemly. About this big, there was a hole in the rug. So Ive asked general services to fix it. This is the 70s. He said You did what? Well the governor cant have a hole in his rug. He said Do you understand this hole has saved us $600 or $700 million. People cant come in here and pound on my desk and say, Give me money for mental health, give me money for this if we have a hole in the rug. So I guarantee you while Jerry Brown is governor Californias finances are going to be just fine.

Thats not the proposition before us, but I think you would want to go to one of the great intellectual capitals.

The question is for Michael and your contention that what were seeing is no different than the historical difference between Northern and Southern states for the blue and the red states.

Is it not the case that what we are finally seeing is over the time of the progressive project in these blue states, well intended as they may be, that those chickens are finally coming home to roost, and that is what is making the difference between the red and the blue states?

The real difference -- it goes back to the fact that we haven't raised yet, which is this has really been two countries for most of its history. You had the slave states and then later the segregation of states, and they just fell behind. In 1900 the difference in per capita income between the south and the north was greater than between Czarist Russia and Victorian Britain. And we've become a much more integrated nation state since then, but you just have a long way to go. And my concern, as a native of the red states, is that the south in particular can get trapped in a permanent semi-developed status if it has an essentially parasitic strategy of trying to use low taxes and anti-union laws to lure businesses from old, more developed parts of the country. We saw what the textile industry -- this can work for a time. In the 20th Century, the Carolinas, other southern states, lured the textile industry, which was actually created in Massachusetts in the northeast. Once you have a global economy there's always a Mexico. There's always a China. And then with China wages go up you lose factories to Vietnam and Thailand. So I don't think any states of the union in the 21st century can count on a race to the bottom where we have lower wages than you do. I think all of the states have to have a race to the top.

I think we all can remember a teacher or a professor in our lives that sparked our imagination, that helped set us on a different course of action. I remember speaking to my history teacher, who was also my baseball coach when I was in the tenth grade, and I wasn't making the baseball team. I didn't think he even noticed me and he came up to me and he says, "Gray Davis, you could actually make something out of your life if you just had a little drive and ambition, but you're such a happy-go-lucky kid, I just don't know what's going to happen to you.

Teachers are very important. Associations and unions obviously fight for better members, for better pay and better conditions. Sometimes I agree with them. Sometimes I didnt. My first year I put in the high school exit exam, the academic performance index. In August of my first year, teachers unions were running commercials against me saying We thought this guy was for education. We don't think he is. I raised the amount of money that went into education by 30 percent. No governor ever has done that. No governor will be able to do that again. So, I rest my case. So I understand the difference between helping education, telling every kid that they can get better, measuring their progress, and paying the price for it with teacher unions.

If you actually look at a county by county basis what you have is very affluent blue cities including blue cities in Texas like Austin and Dallas and Houston, which are increasingly liberal and very, very affluent. Of course it is the case that as areas develop then the middle class and the working class sometimes get forced out because of the cost of living. That is not necessarily a bad thing, because its better than not developing at all. And in fact I think theres good inequality and bad inequality. Good inequality is when the wealthy elite is there because theyre entrepreneurial and theyre inventing something. Bad inequality of the kind thats all too familiar in the South is because of a lack of bargaining power on very low income people who have very little leverage compared to their employers. So you know theres a downside to northern California being the head of the tech industry with billionaires driving up prices and then driving out the middle class, but I would rather be in a state that has that problem than in the other kind of state.

That agony is everywhere in every urban setting but it is more pronounced in the super cities. Ive spent Thursday morning last with Father Gregory Boyle who has been running Homeboy Industries in south central Los Angeles for 24 years I believe. Hes buried 183 gang kids over the course of his ministry. It is a tough, tough place to be poor, it is a wonderful place to be rich.

You know we are now in the fifth year of recovery, the most animated feature of this recovery is the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. Exactly the opposite of what the president wanted to have happen. By the way, I have nothing -- theres nothing at all wrong with people getting rich. Someday I want to be rich myself, but you know the fact is that this has been a dreadful, dreadful recovery for low income people and thats because we have adopted kind of liberal blue state policies on a national level that have reduced opportunities for those at the bottom.

It is simply not the case. Conservatives and Libertarians for 30 years have argued there would be mass unemployment if you raised the minimum wage -- the US raised the minimum wage every few decades. The mass unemployment has not materialized. The mass unemployment we have now, and the weak recovery is not the result of George W. Bush, under whom it started, nor is it to be blamed on Barak Obama. We had the greatest Global depression in fact since the 1930s. We call it the recession. This is a global phenomenon that were working out over many years. And I just think its just kind of petty and partisan to blame it on one president who is being stymied in Congress by filibusters and --

And how it provided structure, opportunity, and growth for legions of people. And the red states have, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the greatest amount of volunteerism, the greatest amount of generosity, the greatest amount of those indicators of community that would provide the guard post for the development of a middle class. Because we all project upon our children their success, our success, but what weve got to really think about is someone whos rising, and where will they be nurtured if they are indeed in the lower class attempting to move to the middle. And I believe the rest states provide the greatest opportunity.

Where simply there arent that many rich people, and there arent that many poor people, theyre largely rural. Many of them were settled by Germans and Scandinavians with a communitarian sense of the local public sector. So I dont think you can make the percentage of the population the main criterion, because the great plains, apart from the ones with recent energy development, have been losing population. People have been moving away from that towards blue states, and some red states, which are more unequal. I think the problem -- the problem is also in opportunity as your economy becomes more complex you get more of a class system. You get more and more rich people and you get some who fall by the wayside.

That is not, I think, the typical red state model that were thinking about, which is more of the southern model of low taxes. Because those states, remember, were quite progressive in the 19th and 20th centuries and they have public banks in some cases.

America is all about believing you can do something, and giving the opportunity to achieve it. Its both in the interest of middle class, the underclass, and the rich for the middle class to do well. Theyre the glue that holds society together. The better they do, the more are more investors. There are better stakeholders. I tried to help that by creating merit scholarships. You didn't have to be poor, but if you tested in the top 10 percent of your class in public school you got $1,000 scholarship every time you did that. I think we all agree education is the passport for a better life. We have to rethink how education can impose less debt on people. Maybe by using online education in a blended fashion, but middle class folks are very important in the blue state model to be responsive to your question.

We've seen a tremendous change in the state of Wisconsin, for example. So, let's call them purple states, the ones that kind of flux back and forth and aren't predictable necessarily. Virginia is a little bit in that position right now.

Look, California has the highest welfare benefits. It used to. I don't know the last few years, but for the last 20 years or so California has had the highest welfare benefits and they've had incredibly high dependency on welfare. We saw in the 1990s one of the great social experiments in this country where states started -- and, by the way, red governors, states like Tommy -- you know, Tommy Thompson and John Engler, they really changed the welfare system, put in place common sense reforms like time limits and work for welfare requirements and getting people back into school, and boy did that work. And one of the things that's discouraging is a lot of blue states are moving away from those policies and put -- I mean, you've got a lot of blue state politicians who actually think it's a stimulus for the economy to put people on food stamps, and I'm not making this stuff up. They think it's good for the economy to put more people on food stamps.

New Mexico, Mississippi, Alaska, Louisiana, West Virginia, North Dakota, Alabama, South Dakota, Virginia. Some of this is farm aid, a majority of it means tested welfare and anti-poverty aid. So if the question is where are benefits at the state level more generous, anti- poverty benefits are more generous in blue states, which tend to be wealthier in general.

Clearly blue states offer opportunity, longevity, better health care; more things are possible. Do we have problems? High taxes, regulations, yes; everything is a mixed bag. Everything has a flip side, but if your son or daughter or grandchildren are looking for a way to help change the world to make an impact on society, to reach their highest potential, they have the best opportunity in the blue states of the north east, the mid-west, and the far west. Steven said to me privately what he said publicly, he said my God, why would anyone live in a state other than California? Steven, I wholeheartedly endorse that sentiment.

I would make the case that those are states that believe in kind of more of a free enterprise, free market system, but you can all choose. Many of you in this room live in blue states, but I would make just a couple of quick points. Just one statistic to think about, each and every day in America for the last 30 years, 1,000 people every day have been leaving blue states and theyve been moving to red states. And I would submit to you that that is prima facie evidence that more opportunity, the very kind of opportunity you were talking about Governor, the kind of jobs that you were talking about, Hugh, those are being created in red states for one reason or another. The energy revolution or the fact that they have lower tax rates or less regulation or right to work, I think they all contribute to that so people can choose where they live and one of the things that we need to do in America, by the way, is get rid of a lot of federal policies and let states decide about health care, let states decide about welfare and work roles and so on and let these ideas flourish, but I would submit to you all if you think about Americas future and you really have to ask yourself this question, where is the future going to happen, America? Is it going to happen in Detroit? Is it going to happen in New York? Is it going to happen in Newark? Is it going to happen in Chicago? Or is it going to happen in places like Salt Lake, in places like Atlanta, in places like Kansas City, in states -- in places like Austin, and I would submit to you the future is going to happen in the places where the free enterprise system is flourishing. The free enterprise system is the goose that lays the golden eggs. Thats where you want to be.

In the last couple of years, Stanford University in conjunction with Google has driven hundreds of thousands of miles with its self-driving robot cars, which were the result in turn, of a competition sponsored by the federal government in conjunction with this leading California research university. I am from the red states, I like the red states; I would like to see California, New York, Massachusetts cut down to size. I frankly -- I would, personally. I do not think in my lifetime Im going to live long enough to see Salt Lake City, Atlanta, and even Austin, my hometown, be competitive when it comes to nanotech and breakthroughs in robot technology and world class finance. Now thats not necessarily the test, but if you paint this picture of California and Massachusetts and New York, which have lead the economy for much of the 20th century and still do, in many high tech sectors, being emptied out as though they were East Germany, and people are fleeing like boat people and so on, I just think thats a very misleading picture. There are real trends, and its not a matter of good and bad on both sides, but I think that blue states for the foreseeable future will not merely surpass the red states, but will continue to provide a model, because the revealed preference, as Hugh Hewitt says, is the fact that when they move to red states like Texas, the overwhelming number of new migrants are going to blue cities. Cities that vote liberal and vote democratic. Like Dallas, Austin and Houston, which as a result of this migration have become much more liberal than before the people moved there.

And thanks to Stephen who actually made the case that I think we were done after round one. I really would like your vote, and I really would because I think it would send a message. Let me tell you in 1998, the year that Governor Davis was elected, we passed one of our propositions, Prop 10, which put a 50 cent per pack tax on cigarettes. And then that money goes back to the counties, to the boards that spend it on children 0-5 to improve their health and their readiness to learn. Ive served on my Orange County prop 10 board for 15 years. The problems are staggering. The amount of dysfunction in the urban core. The falling behind. The inability health problems. The onset of adult diabetes in children under the age of 12 is epidemic. Learning disabilities, autism is skyrocketing. Heres the difference between red and blue: blue states have sclerosis. They cannot innovate, they are in the grips of special interests that have vested interests that refuse to allow them to do things that are necessary. Red states believe in innovation, and Im glad we brought up Scott Walker, who took an enormous amount of heat for attempting to change the basic paradigm of his state. In order to make these pressing new problems, which are global and transformative, you have to have political systems that will move, and will be nimble and will try and innovate and experiment. You need freedom. And the freedom that Im talking about, the freedom that Stephen Moore writes about all the time, the freedom that we all share. Everyone wants all states to succeed. Right, Im not against the blue states, Im just trying to simply that if blue states want to succeed they will adopt red state measures and red state flexibility and mostly red state freedom. Thank you very much.

And that concludes our closing statements. And now its time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. Were going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat and register where you stand on this motion after hearing all of the debaters present their arguments. The motion is For a better future, live in a red state. If you agree with this motion, if you agree with this team, if you are with the team arguing with the red states push number one. If you disagree, if you are with the team that effectively is arguing for the blue states, because theyre arguing against the motion push number two. If youre undecided, if you became undecided, or remain undecided, push number three. And you can ignore all of the other keys, they are not live, and we will have the results in just about two minutes. While we wait for that to happen I have a few things that I would like to say. First of all as Bob Rosenkranz said at the opening our goal at Intelligence Squared US as a philanthropy is to raise the level of public discourse, and we count on the debaters to bring a style and a tone of argument to our stage in order to meet that goal. And these four debaters just did that excellently. I really want to congratulate them for doing that. Secondly on the whole matter of audience questions, I know its very, very tough to get up in front of a microphone and even tougher if the moderator says Thats really not on point, so to all of those people to whom I had to say that I sincerely, actually congratulate you and honor you for getting up. It's just that we try to squeeze it into this very narrow format. So, my apologies with respect. There was nothing wrong with any of those questions, and some of them might actually sponsor some pretty good debate topics for us in the future. So, thank you to all of the people that asked questions. And finally, we'd like to thank the Philanthropy Roundtable for inviting us to put on this debate as part of your annual meeting. Thank you. We would love it if there are Twitterers in the crowd to tweet about this debate. Our Twitter handle is @iq2us. The hashtag for this debate is #redstate. Also, for those of you who might be in New York later on this fall, we have a pretty busy season coming up on a range of topics. On October 30th we will be debating the global job market. The motion that night: "Let Anyone Take a Job Anywhere. On November 14 we are debating this quote, unquote: "The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness. On December 4 we are debating: "Don't Eat Anything with a Face. All of these will be live-streamed, by the way. So if you can't get to New York you can watch them. If you're in Washington, D.C., on November 20, we are partnering with the McCain Institute. Were debating NSA surveillance. Tickets for all of these debates are on sale now and for more information or to join our mailing list go to our website, www.iq2us.org. And as I said also at the beginning our debates are on NPR stations across the country. So, all right. You have voted twice. The results are in. Our motion is this: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. The way this works, you voted twice. The team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms between the two votes is declared our winner. Here is the result of the preliminary vote on the motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. Fifty-four percent of you agreed with this motion at the outset. Twenty-four percent were against. Twenty-two percent were divided. Those are the first results. Remember, you voted again. The team that's changed the numbers the most in percentage point terms is the winner. Let's go to the second vote. The team arguing for the motion, their second vote was 73 percent. They went from 54 percent to 73 percent. They picked up 19 percentage points. That is the number to beat. Let's go to the team against the motion. They went from 24 percent to 23 percent. They lost 1 percent. It means the team that's arguing for the motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State," has carried this debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donovan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

We are sharing credit with the fact that we're putting this debate on with Columbia University's Richard Paul Richmond Center for Business Law and Public Policy. That -- I can see the spontaneous applause thing is going to work really well. I do want to say that it's a joint venture of the law school and the business school. And they have, as we do, a goal of trying to raise the level of public discourse, in their case where law, and markets, and business intersect. So, again, I thank you, let's give them a round of applause -- The other reason we have these debates, of course, is because of the Rosenkranz Foundation, which launched them six years ago and sponsored them, and I want a welcome now to help us frame the debate and talk about why we're doing this by inviting onto the stage the chairman of the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Mr. Robert Rosenkranz. So, Bob, as I always ask you before these debates, why this one and why now?

One is the matter of fairness, one is efficiency, and one is sufficiency.

On the other hand, if you work for a billionaire who's paying a lower tax rate than you are, you're not going to see it as fair.

" And I think the pro motion side is going to point to the fact that it's really spending that's the problem. We're spending about 24 percent of GNP on federal expenditures. The norm in the last 20 years have been about 21 percent, and we've got to get spending under control. The other side is going to say, "Wait a second. Tax collections are only about 16 percent of GNP compared to 19 percent. We need to raise more money. " And if we remember the words of Willie Sutton, "Go where the money is. "

What kind of tax system would best stimulate the growth in the economy? And I think the pro the motion side is going to argue that it's very, very important to preserve the incentives that the "rich," quote, unquote, have to risk money to invest to create jobs for others. The against the motion side is probably going to point to the fact that a dollar in the hands of a middle class family is going to be spent, and in a direct way stimulate economic activity; whereas a dollar in the hands of a rich person might just sit there.

Youve got to ask, well, what do you mean by rich? How much, how much is rich? How much money does that take? And, what do we mean by "enough"? Now, consider that to be counted in the top 1 percent of earners in America, you need to be making approximately $380,000 a year. Consider, also, that that 1 percent pays more than a third, as of 2009, pays more than a third of all of the federal income tax that comes in to the federal government. Is that too much? Is that too little? Well, let's make a debate of it. True or false, the rich are taxed enough. Another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., I'm John Donvan, we have four superbly qualified debaters who will be arguing for, and against, this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. They go in three rounds and then the audience votes to choose a winner, and only one side wins. Our debaters include, on the side arguing for the motion, Glenn Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Business School and economic advisor to Mitt Romney. Your partner it Art Laffer, he is best known for the Laffer Curve, one of the main theoretical constructs of supply side economics. On the side arguing against the motion, Robert Reich, he's a professor at UC Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration. And his partner, Mark Zandi, he's chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. Let's meet our debaters and welcome first, Glenn Hubbard. Glenn, you are dean of the Columbia Business School, you are also -- throughout 2012, you've been advisor to Mitt Romney's campaign. Recently you were profiled in The New York Times, and you were described there as, "succinct, authoritative, and unabashedly partisan. " I want to know, is that fair? Are you unabashedly partisan? And could you be succinct and authoritative?

Thank -- I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on topic this important. My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start. But I just want to make two points this evening. First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that Americans have traditionally had. I'll come back to that point. Second, if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich. Now, let's start with how high tax rates are. If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid. If that's true, the current and projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income. And, if you're New Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a lot on the table here. And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there. And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime. All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond. Now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns. First, if you step back, they treat the nation's income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's sliced. An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make. Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes. The second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government. And here my observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it. The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich. Now, let's start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates. Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it. And economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high. Now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving. And, here, I just want to offer you a forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that "Glenn can't even forecast the past. " And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it's worth. But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates. The responses of high income tax payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers. Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income. High business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs. More than half of Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates. Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment. If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent. And high tax rates don't necessarily produce revenue. The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times. The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers. Now, what about the larger government? Before the financial crisis, federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades. What if we decide we'd like a bigger government? Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many European countries. Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government? Well, the simple answer is no. Or, more accurately, it can't. If you look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may surprise some of you. The U.S. has the most progressive tax system. And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country's tax system. So you think to yourself, "Well, how can this be? We're thinking of European nations with large government and social welfare programs. " But the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending. So the real choice is the size of government. That's the debate we need to have first. Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards. The right tax system for this country can accomplish both. And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals. If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay. The rich are not a plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch. For the proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes.

But we're in a recovery. Look. I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a chance to vote against it again. It's an absurd motion for the following reasons. Number one, we have a huge budget deficit. Even if we didn't want to expand the size of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a gigantic budget deficit. And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross domestic product. And the question is how do you get the deficit down? How do you get the debt down? Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. The Simpson-Bowles commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "Well, we have one dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts. " But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax increases. Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are in the middle, or is it people who are poor? And I want to tell you in terms of common sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top. Why, why, why? You can applaud, but don't take away from my time. Why? Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good. I mean, the percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one percent, has doubled over the past 30 years. It used to be 10 percent back in 1980. It's now over 20 percent. That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 percent of total income. If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years. If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total income over the last 30 years. The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really something new in this country, at least within people's living memory. It wasn't this way in the '50s or '60s or '70s. It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s. So, if we're going to have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the top. Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, "Well, you have a negative effect, a negative incentive effect. " Come on. In the immortal words of Joe Biden, "Malarkey! " I mean, look. The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981 -- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at least 70 percent. Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly would not have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes under Eisenhower was 91 percent. If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher than anybody today is talking about. We're talking -- right now, we're talking about the difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's days? I mean, this is a ridiculous debate. It should not even be debated obviously. Given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this question. I mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic growth. Well, guess what? In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981. There was no negative impact on growth. I mean, George W. Bush reduces -- remember 1981 -- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, "Oh, we're going to get this huge increase in growth, and we're going to get all kinds of jobs," using and spouting supply-side -- excuse me, Art -- nonsense -- -- and what did we get? We actually had less growth. We had fewer jobs, even before the great crash. We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were created. That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth. We raised taxes, 22 million new jobs were created. I was secretary of labor during those times. I created every single one of those jobs. Thank you. Thank you very much. So just to -- in summary -- -- we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government. Number two, the rich have done extraordinarily well. Everybody else hasn't. In fact, median family incomes since 2000 have actually dropped 8 percent. You want to put more taxes on average working people? No. That's simply not fair. It's not going to work. Number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era. Of course you have to raise taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country. So please vote against this silly proposition. Thank you.

And I remind you of where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate. My name is John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two who are arguing it out over this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. You have heard the first two debaters, and now on to the third. I'd like to introduce and bring to the lectern Art Laffer. He is the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates and Laffer Investments. He is known as the father of supply side economics, was a former advisor to President Ronald Reagan. Ladies and gentlemen, Art Laffer.

I came in a little early. And I went down to the health club. And now, I'm not an exercise freak or anything. But I was down there. And this absolutely gorgeous woman walked in. She's just beautiful. And the manager of the health club was standing right next to me, so I said, "Excuse me, by any chance do you have a machine that would attract someone like that to someone like me? " And the guy says, "Yes, I do. " And he took me over to the Citicorp ATM. And I just want to say that the rich are not the Citicorp ATM. If you look at this world, and I -- but, Robert, you're a favorite of mine, and you have been for years; and, Glenn, you did a great job on this; and Mark, I'm anticipating your comments and -- but look at it, you got -- there would be three reasons you could possibly want to raise tax rates on the rich. You're jealous of them, and Robert may be but he's one of them. And the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue. And you're going to create prosperity. Those are the other two. And I'm going to land on the last two and look at the facts if I can. I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s. It was called the "Roaring 20s" for a reason. We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and employment. The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top 1 percent of income earners. The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them. And we have great data. The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of GDP soared during the period of the Roaring '20s. If you look at the 1930s, we raised the highest margin -- well, we first had May of 1930 we had the Smoot- Hawley Tariff. Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent. Then Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent. There's a reason why it was called the Great Depression. The economy was in a shambles in large part because of the tax increases. The revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period. You look at the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent. We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate rates, did tariff reform as well -- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate -- it was called the -- it was called the "Go-Go '60s," if you remember, a boom in the economy, and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period as a share of GDP. We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put on planet Earth. If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years. The stock market collapsed during that period. Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners went down as a share of GDP. Then we had -- then we had Ronny -- oh, excuse me, the sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals, they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of everything we could find. We had Steiger-Hansen in '78, then we cut the -- I mean, under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent. If you look at the whole period from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50 percent to 35 percent. We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70 percent to 15 percent. We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board. We had a boom, and it wasn't just Ronald Reagan. Robert, your president, by the way, cut the capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group between 65 and 72. He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the greatest secretary of labor of all time -- But he was a big taxer. We had huge growth during that period. If you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP. By 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more than doubled. Let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys. You're not. They can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators -- They can hire -- when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don't for a moment think it's a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it's like being poor. They're in there for some reason and they find it. You know, what you really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff. And get them out of the business of trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic growth. And that is the way you got to go. We all want increased tax rates on the rich, but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it by lowering rates and broadening the base. And if I can correct one other little mistake, Robert, just a little one. Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici. They lower rates, they broaden the base. In '86, we cut tax rates on the rich dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent. In the Senate, 97 votes for that, three against it, including Joe Biden. What was his malarkey comment? Excuse me, maybe he was looking in the mirror. But you also had Bill Bradley, you also had Howard Metzenbaum, you had all of these -- and you had Chris Dodd and you had Teddy Kennedy. Everyone knows that you don't create growth by raising tax rates on the rich. You can't love jobs and hate job creators. And you can't tax an economy into prosperity, it ain't going to happen. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Art Laffer. Our motion is The Rich Are Taxed Enough. And here is our final speaker, making his opening statement, Mark Zandi. Mark is the chief economist of Moody's Analytics and is one of the most frequently cited economists in Washington; he's also the author of this book, "Paying the Price, Ending the Great Recession, and Beginning a New American Century. " Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Zandi.

Thank you. Thank you, John. Thanks, Intelligence Squared and Bob Rosenkranz for the opportunity. I did notice that on Amazon the price of my book is falling; demand, supply, you know. We need a little more demand here to help me out. Let me begin by saying that, you know, it's obvious the American economy has very serious challenges. But I would put two right at the top of the list. The first, this is in no particular order of importance, but the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the second is our fiscal problems. The statistics here are pretty startling. Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth distribution. If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income. They consume 60 percent of the total pie. So, from cars to clothing and everything in between, they consume 60 percent. And they own 90 percent of the wealth. These are pretty skewed statistics. And the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed over the past 30 years. You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these statistics were very different. I'll just give you one example. I mentioned that the top 20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending. If you go back to 1980, it was closer to 45 percent. So, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed. Our fiscal problems are obviously very significant as well. If you go back to the year 2000 -- we'll give Bob credit for the 22 million jobs. Should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too? Okay, Bob. Let's clap for that. There was a surplus, 2000. We've been running deficits ever since. The last fiscal year just ended. We had a deficit of $1.1 trillion. You can ask, "Well, what's going on? " Lots of things. There's the wars. That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years. That's Afghanistan and Iraq. There's the Bush era tax cuts. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period. And, of course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years. You add it up, it's a lot of money. So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle. Now, the bad news is that -- it sounds pretty bad -- The bad news is that if we -- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act. If they don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very self-reinforcing in a negative way. Take the deficits. If policymakers continue on with current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go from the current 70 percent -- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 35 to 70 percent -- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025. Now, all good research would show that we got a problem if that happens. The world's not going to work for us. At some point, investors are going to balk. Interest rates are going to rise. It's going to affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards. That has to change. And the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to - - are firmly in place, and they're not going to change. There's many. Globalization -- a great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological change -- these are all really very good things for our economy. We need to continue on with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth. I'm a person with no skills and talent, I'm getting creamed by trade. I'm competing against low-wage workers in China and India. I can't compete. I'm just getting crushed. And, of course, high income households are benefitting enormously, right? I mean, Glenn, Art, Bob go off to China, they go off to India, they go off to the UK to give a speech, they get paid very well. Unfortunately, I'm not in their class, you know? I don't get paid as well. But, it's globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth rises. And I think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, "Enough! " And they're going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher income households. Now, here's the good news. We can solve this problem, and we can solve it together in a combined way. We have to think about addressing our fiscal problems through the prism of the income -- the distribution of income and wealth. So, we need to cut government spending? Absolutely. We have to do this. But, we have to do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs. You know, take -- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance policies, but that only goes so far. We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security. That'd only take us so far. So we have to address taxes. If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right? I am all for tax reform. Let's close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right? I mean, that is the best way, that is the way proposed by Simpson-Bowles, that's the way proposed by Domenici-Rivlin, and that is a bipartisan way. So this is not hard. It's -- we can do it, and that's the good news. Now, let me end this way with a personal note. I started my own company back 25 years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother. And I wasn't in the proverbial garage but I was pretty close. It grew into a pretty good size -- a small business. I had 100 employees when I sold it to the Moody's Corporation. And the reason I'm telling you this is because I wanted to let you know that I'm not just an egghead. You know, I look like one maybe, but I'm not. So I look at these things through the -- in terms of data, theory, and experience. And my experience says, "You need to vote against this proposition. " Thank you.

And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate where the debaters are arguing it out over this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. Now we move on to Round 2. And Round 2 is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and from you in the audience. Our motion is this: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. We have two teams of two arguing it out. The team arguing for the motion, Glenn Hubbard and Arthur Laffer, are basically saying that taxing the rich is something that is absolutely going to backfire, that taxes have consequences on behavior, and that the wealthy, who would be the provider of jobs by being the builders of factories would be discouraged from doing so. And that as a result of that, not only would they be able to dodge their taxes as Art Laffer pointed out by hiring lawyers and he also said hiring senators -- -- but they will also not be giving jobs to people who would help broaden the tax base.

And we know that both sides to some degree are wandering through forests of data, and each are finding their own path possibly through the same forest -- -- picking out different periods of time to prove their points, but I want to go to -- before we get to --

We've been talking about The Rich Are Taxed Enough. And "enough" has a couple of connotations, and one is "enough" to actually bring in revenues to pay for the government. The other is "enough" to be fair, to meet some sense of fairness. And I want to bring to the side that's arguing for the motion that The Rich Are Taxed Enough, the question of fairness. Is the system, as it is now, at tax rates that exist now, in a system that -- the one that we have, is it fair? Art Laffer.
The rich are taxed enough|i2Debates/102412 taxes.p|53|R3|ARTHUR LAFFER|for|0|5|1|0|0|17|0|18|0|0|3|6|45|22|0|6|9|2|0|0|0|179|1|0|2|0|0|10|13|0|0|2|22|2|23|4|3|0|0|1|18|8|1|31|36|21|56|8|26|0|0|6|0|12|39|14|0|6|2|1|43|2|19|9|19|310|Yeah. No, it's not. It's totally not. And let me use an example if I may, Warren Buffett. He was sitting there asking my friends and I need to have higher tax rates, and I looked at his letter to the New York Times, and he said he paid a little less than 7 million in taxes, and he said his tax rate was 17.4 percent, which I did the math, hold back, I'm a wiz, but I divided it. He had adjusted gross income of $40 million in that year. I then went to Forbes. His wealth increased from 40 billion to 50 billion. I went to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and what you found there is he gave 1.75 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not counting his sons foundations or his daughter's foundation. Now, as a definition of "income," to me income is what you spend, what you give away, and your increase in your wealth. It s called the Simon definition of income. If you look at Bill Gates -- I mean -- if you look at Warren Buffett, his income that year was $12 billion, and he paid 7 million in taxes. That is a tax rate of six 1/100th of 1 percent on his true income. That is obnoxious. But it's not because of any rates raising would change that tax. You've got to broaden the tax base by getting rid of all these exclusions, deductions, eliminations, and tax true income at low rates. And that is what's fair. The guys who play the game, and you look at the Forbes 500 and you see all of them with their tax exemptions, look at all the 501c3s, all the loopholes. That's what we've got to go after, not raising tax rates on the last three people who actually pay it.

The proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough. Taxed. What we're arguing is that we want to raise more tax revenue. We'd prefer to do it by broadening the tax base. I would love to do it. Now, we have to look at it from a clear eyed perspective. Can we really -- we've tried, and we've done it once or twice, to broaden the base sufficiently, to raise revenue. But, if we can't, then we raise tax rates. But everyone would agree that we want revenue, and we want to do it through broadening the tax base.

First of all, there's been some discussion of Bowles-Simpson, but I think it's important for everyone to understand the marginal tax -- the top marginal rate in the Bowles-Simpson compromise plan is 28 percent. And that's financed by broadening the tax base. If we have a healthy tax system, the growth that that engenders will, in fact, raise revenue, yes, but it's not by raising tax rates. Second point, in fairness, is the OECD point that I made. If you look across industrial countries, the U.S. actually has, by far, the most progressive tax system. We rely much more on taxes that affect high income individuals that peer countries, and we do so for the reason I suggested. The third point I want to mention, if you add up all the tax increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in Washington, it's about 1 percent of GDP. The Congressional Budget Office has come up tonight. They would tell you that the long-term problem in Social Security and Medicare alone is on the order of 10 percentage points of GDP. Anybody who's selling you that taxes on the rich are going to get us out of the fiscal hole doesn't know the math.

First of all, the reason that the European tax system looks more progressive than ours is because the gap between the rich and the poor in Europe is not nearly as great as it in the United States. We have the highest gap between the rich and the poor. Secondly, Arthur Laffer just admitted something that I hope you heard. That is that when you close loopholes that are taken advantage of, mostly by the rich, you are, in a sense, raising their taxes. They're actually providing more in taxes. The proposition we are debating is whether the rich are taxed enough. We are saying, Mark and I, that that is wrong. The rich are not taxed enough. If one way we use to get the rich to pay more is to close, for example, the carried interest loophole that allows private equity managers to treat their income as capital gains taxed at 15 percent, that means that Mitt Romney will be taxed more than he is now.

So, what you're doing is raising revenue in a more efficient way. Some individuals may pay more. And, if the economy grows, virtually everyone will pay more, and that's just fine.

First, this is my view. Glenn, I think we need to address spending. We have to. I mean, if you look at Simpson-Bowles or any proposal that's reasonable, most of the onus of addressing our fiscal problems is on the spending side. So, I'm with you on that. But, all of these proposals also say we need to generate revenue. This has got to be a shared burden in terms of spending and tax. So, no disagreement there. The second thing I say is that if we can raise tax revenue by lowering the deductions and credits in the tax code -- and there're some very creative ways of doing it. Marty Feldstein has a great proposal. Both Governor Romney and President Obama have put proposals that are not dissimilar in this regard in terms of capping the amount of deductions and credits that an individual can take, and that would burden -- in theory, would land on higher-income households. I'm all for that. But I think it's also important that we do this in a way that we're clear-eyed, because -- in a political sense, a political economy sense -- because we know it's going to be really hard to scale back those deductions and credits in the tax code. It's -- you know, for every credit and deduction in the code, there is a constituency that literally will go to war for it. So, we know that. So, in that context, we have to think about -- well, maybe we have to raise marginal rates to generate that revenue, to get to the point where we're going to address our long-term fiscal problems and --

So, let's be clear. The current budget has spending full three percentage points higher than traditional levels in the country. It is proposing to raise taxes on high-income people by 1 percent of GDP, and we just don't know what happens to the other two. In the long term, as I've said, just Social Security and Medicare alone are 10 times the cost, even of the most optimistic tax increases. So, taxes aren't even an important part of this conversation. And, to the extent that they are, they would have to follow the European model, which is to raise them on everyone, a consumption tax.

There are two ways of raising revenues. Almost everybody up here agrees, I think, that we've got to raise some revenues. We may have to do a lot of spending reductions as well, but we've got to raise some revenues if we're going to deal with the budget deficit problem. There are two ways of doing it. One is raising marginal income tax rates, and the second is closing loopholes. Now, the question really is when you do one or both of those, are you going to have the rich paying more, or is the middle class going to have to pay more, or the poor going to have to pay more? What Mark and I are saying is that when you get more revenue, either by closing loopholes or by raising marginal rates, the rich should end up paying more as a matter of logic, as a matter of fairness, as a matter of history, as a matter of common sense.

Of course you do. I mean -- and there's nothing wrong with the rich paying more in taxes if -- with the prosperity, which is exactly what happened, what I showed in the numbers there. During the Roaring '20s, the rich paid more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically. If you look at the Kennedy period, the rich paid a lot more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically. Under the Reagan/Clinton period, the rich paid a lot more by lowering rates dramatically and creating prosperity. That is the dream, and that's where we go. You cannot balance the budget on the backs of the unemployed. You just plain can't. And that's what you have to do.

But -- but beyond that, I want to point out, this is an interesting historic footnote -- Arthur, you keep going back to the 1920s, the Roaring '20s, there were two years over the last century, two years in which the richest Americans took home the highest percentage of total income in America. Those two years were 1928 and 2007. Now, does it strike anybody here interesting -- -- as a matter of what happens when the rich take home so much of the total income, does it strike anybody here that there may be a consequence? There may be.

And if you look at effective tax rates across the income distribution, and not just income tax but you consider the payroll tax, you consider the incidence of corporate tax, excise taxes, you know, you roll it all up, this is data, you can go look it up, it's Congressional Budget Office data, and they have it over time, it's true that effective tax rates have fallen for everybody across the income distribution since the date it begins, 1979, 1980, but it's also true that it's fallen very significantly for higher income households. And, in fact, interesting statistic, for the top 1 percent of earners, the decline in the effective tax rate, 1979 to 2010, has declined by more than any other income group, the effective tax rate. So you can argue, and this is often the argument you will hear, that the wealthy pay their higher share of total taxes, but the reason is because they're earning so much more income, and their effective tax rate is a lot --

Otherwise, why are we going to do tax reform? And that's fine, but that will raise revenue. But we are not arguing for non- revenue neutral tax changes. It's up to you to argue that raising marginal rates, which you've referred to a few times this evening, actually is the way to go.

That's what we are discussing tonight. And my contention and the contention that I think Mark agrees with as well, is that there is not an inconsistency between fairness and economic growth. In fact, the rich would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a large share of an economy that's dead in the water. Why? Because it's dead in the water because the distribution of income is so crazy.

" We had those tax cuts. We had that growth. We have the rich becoming very prosperous. There's nothing wrong with the rich being rich. The problem is when the poor are poorer. The dream has always been to make the poor rich, and during the '20s, when we had the Roaring '20s, no other country did the tax codes we did. After World War I they all stayed in depression the whole time. That is the key here. There's nothing wrong with the prosperity we had from the '80s on. But I'll tell you what happened in the 1920s -- and they paid a lot more in taxes.

What happened? People in the middle, in order to maintain their standard of living, they borrowed, they borrowed, and they borrowed. And people at the top gambled, and they gambled recklessly. And those bubbles exploded in 1929 and in 2008.

You referred to globalization, there are skill gaps among low income people, I'm not connecting the dots, from your tax policy to dealing with the problem that actually should concern America.

We need the revenue to go to the government sufficient to educate the population and bring the skill attainment of those workers that are getting creamed by China up, so that they can compete in a global economy. We can't do that unless we have sufficient revenue. Now, we all know revenue is very low, 17 percent of GDP. Since 1980, the revenue to GDP ratio was averaged 19.5 percent. It's very, very low. Government spending is high. I'm all for getting government spending down. I think that's absolutely correct, but we also have to, in a balanced way, get revenue up --

You know, you argue lower tax rates improve economic growth, all else being equal. And, you know, I have some sympathy to that argument when we're lowering tax rates from 90 percent, which is what they were when Kennedy took office and we lowered them to 70. And Ronald Reagan took them from 70 to 28. You know, the academic literature on this, frankly, is not clear. There's no proof academically, but, okay, I'm sympathetic to the idea. But what I think is prudent -- if I were a prudent planner, and if I was sitting at the ONB or the CBO, I'd say, "You know what? We better -- if we raise taxes or lower tax rates, if we move tax rates, if we move tax rates -- we better think about this in an accounting sense, not in, we can generate some economic growth and that's going to generate revenue, and, by the way, the kids are going to be dancing in the streets and eating chocolate bars. You know, that's not what we should be doing. We should be thinking about this in a purely accounting -- well, and if it all works out and you're right, that's gravy, we're fine.

It was a tax reform bill that went across. We lowered the highest rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. And, in the Senate, we got 97 votes, three against us, and all these others voted with us.

You know, we can debate the number, but let's go with it. Simpson-Bowles would say, Dominici-Rivlin would say let's do $2 trillion in government spending, let's get $1 trillion in tax revenue, right? And they would say, "Let's do the tax revenue by broadening the base, but if we can't broaden the base, we got to get the revenue from somewhere, right? " And if you do those things then, then -- Glenn -- then the expenditure-to-GDP ratio goes to 21 percent -- that's the average since 1980 -- and the revenue-to-GDP goes to 19 percent. That's the average to 1980.

Basically, Glenn Hubbard was saying that he understood what your aspirations were for funding certain kinds of government programs that would be restorative of education, et cetera, and he said that you can't get it from the wealthy, that if -- politically, you can't get it, you can't raise rates to that degree for the reason that Bob gave because it's a closed loop. I want to know economically could you get it, because their argument is that economically you can't because the behavior of the wealthy would change in such a way that they just wouldn't -- they wouldn't participate. Number one, they wouldn't participate -- they would move their money offshore, and they wouldn't invest here. And that's kind of the core of their argument. Can you take that on?

I mean, I don't think that -- first of all, I think the best way of approaching this is broadening the tax base. That's -- I'm on board with that. But if we have to go down -- if we can't raise the revenue, the trillion in revenue through tax broadening, I'm all for raising marginal rates. But, when I talk about raising marginal rates, I'm talking about putting them back to the era when this fellow was labor secretary and generating 22 million jobs. I'm talking about 35 percent today to 39.6 percent on personal income. And you can -- we can talk about cap gains and dividend income and so forth and Obamacare and health care tax, all those kinds of things --those kinds of things will generate a trillion in revenue. And I don't think -- and, again, this is my view, experience -- I don't thinkthe American wealthy are going to move offshore and not pay their taxes.

We know that they aren't because there have been a number of experiments. One experiment is an experiment that we ran in this country between 1946 and 1981 when tax rates, as I said before -- officially, marginal tax rates were at least 70 percent, and the effective rate after deductions and tax credits was about 54, 55, 56 percent. Maybe it was slightly more difficult then to move abroad or shift your money abroad, that's true, but also legally we could have then, as we can now, make it very difficult to do that. The real issue here -- and, Glenn, what you keep on wanting to do, and Art, you do too -- is you are saying in effect we ought to broaden the base and not raise marginal rates.

One is to broaden the base and one is to lower rates, not raise them. And that is the way to get your prosperity. As you looked at every time, you go back to the Kennedy period where rates were much higher and all that, when Kennedy lowered those rates, guess what happened to revenues? They went up as a share of GDP, not down from the top 1 percent of income earners. Not only did those revenues go up, but there were secondary and tertiary rate -- revenues going in, for the jobs that they created the output, the employment, the production, all of that. They're huge revenue raisers. That is not true of any other income group. It's not. You raise tax rates on the poor or the middle income and you collect more revenues, but not on the rich. You want more revenues from the rich, which I do, what you do is you broaden the base and you lower the rates, and both of those will bring you more revenue, period.

And do you raise or lower marginal rates? " The question is, should the rich pay more or are the rich taxed enough? Now, let's take an example. Take the mortgage interest deduction, which is the most sacred of sacred cows. Now, here is what we know about the mortgage interest deduction. Mortgage interest deduction is essentially a subsidy for housing, but who gets the lion's share of the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction? Well, here's what we know, that four times more of that subsidy goes to the top 20 percent of Americans, than the total amount of public housing assistance that goes to the bottom 20 percent of Americans. So why not limit the total mortgage interest deduction per year, to something like, let's say, $10,000 per year. Why not limit other deductions to, say, a total of $10,000 or $12,000 a year. You -- if you do that, you are increasing revenues from the rich. If you do that, you are actually voting against the proposition.

My father was a small businessman. He was small and he was a small businessman. But, look, if we, for example, as a nation decide that next year we are going to continue the Bush tax cuts for people earning under $250,000, but the income over $250,000 is going to go back to the Clinton kind of rates, is that going to be such a huge burden for small businesses? Well, only about 2 to 3 percent of the small businesses earn over $250,000. And we're only talking about that amount of income over $250,000, so a small businessperson who earns $251,000 that year is only going to be paying the Clinton rate on $1,000 of income. And, by the way, that Clinton rate was not so onerous; small businesses did much better under Bill Clinton than they've doing recently over the last 10 years.

And, if you look at the calculation that I made for you, if you compare what's going to happen to investment and hiring by those individuals as they're paying taxes at individual rates, you're looking at changes on the order of 50 percent in investment, 14 percent in hiring, in an era when the economy is struggling. You know, there's a reason the president took a pass on raising marginal rates the last time.

And my experience says, no, it doesn't matter. I'm driven by lots of other things and raising marginal rates from 35 to 40 or 45, it's not going to make a difference in terms of my thinking. So, no. My experience -- and I don't think the data suggests that this is going to have a significant impact. One other thing about small business that I just think it's very important to point out, that most small businesses are proprietorships, they're professionals like doctors and dentists, plumbers, electricians, they're not making $250,000, they're not going to be affected by this. The folks that are going to be affected by this are, you know, they're hedge fund owners, they're different kinds of small businesses that, they're motivated by different things. So when people talk about small business, they have some -- they're thinking about something totally different than the folks that will be affected by the higher marginal rates that we're talking about here.

The wealthy in our society should pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, and I don't think any serious -- at least economist -- has suggested otherwise. But, to me, there's a strong element of social justice that's forgotten in that conversation, and this goes back to the conversation Mark and I were having earlier. We really need a society that helps put people back on the ladder, and that's not a discussion of whose marginal tax rate is X or Y, but a discussion of how as a country we're going to help those people succeed. That's the social justice.

You're exactly right, Glenn. We want an economy and a society that enables everybody to have an opportunity to make the most of themselves and to go up that ladder. But, as the gap grows, what we are finding is that upward mobility in America is slowing. In fact, relative to places like Canada, we have a much slower degree of upward mobility. The chances that a poor kid is going to be a poor adult is greater in the United States than it is -- not only in Canada, but greater than in Germany, greater than in most of Europe, greater than in every place in rich nations other than Britain and Italy.

And if the rich are not going to pitch in, we are not going to be able to do it.

I've already mentioned that in the context of the OECD. It's also the case, though, that there's a pretty poor link between changing marginal tax rates at the top and accomplishing much of any of this. It's really a question of setting priorities in government. Do we want to be a country that has a few entitlement programs that have all of our spending dollars, or do we want to invest in the future?

The tax code does help reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth. If you look at the so-called Gini Coefficient -- another -- I'm sorry, but this is very easy. So, Gini Coefficient, best way to measure the income distribution. If it's zero, you've got everyone getting the same income. If it's 1, that's bad. One person's getting all the income. So, the Gini Coefficient pre-tax is -- back in 1980 was .38. Today it's .48. So that means the distribution of income is getting wider. Take the tax code, run it through, calculate the Gini Coefficient, we now go from .34 to .44. So, yeah, it did, in fact, reduce the skewing of the distribution of income and wealth, but the point is the skewing is still very significant and getting wider by the day. And this is a very significant problem. Our Tax Code really hasn't helped with that issue.

If you are talking about getting the deficit down, reducing the debt, not only do you have to cut federal spending, you also have to rely on some net increase in revenues. And that net increase in revenues we believe should come primarily -- whether it's base broadening or rate increasing it should come primarily from the wealthy. And if you agree with us, then you think this proposition is wrong.

I would prefer not to raise tax rates on anybody, I'd like to even cut them. And, in fact, if we broaden the base enough, Art's right, we can lower the tax rates and generate revenue, and that has to come from higher income households. So let's just make that very clear. Now, if we're debating the impacts of taxes and spending, it's just the opposite. I mean, my view is, the spending multipliers are larger than the tax multipliers, in general, on average. You know, it depends on the situation, the tax, and the spending, so forth and so on. But, you know, on average that's the case. Spending multipliers are larger. Now -- but you've heard me before say, I think most of the onus of deficit reduction and achieving fiscal sustainability has to be on the spending cuts, because if you look, again, at current spending and current revenue, it's mostly the spending that's out of line, relative to our historical norms. And we have to get the spending down. And --

Now, your question gets to the core of why it's important to separate those two parts. There's a big difference between changing the path of fiscal policy by raising taxes and cutting spending. And I think the bulk of the evidence would suggest, yes, that the tax increase way would be more costly on the multipliers.

When I listen to all these numbers, I'm kind of reminded of, I guess it was Twain, we have liars, damned liars, and statistics. And it seems like, probably either of you could argue the other person's point. But the question I have is really to the con side, and that is, it seems to me the fundamental question was raised by Glenn at the beginning, which is, what is the size of government that you want? And I'd like to, kind of, move the debate, or move the question, back to what Bob was originally talking about, I think, when he was talking about sufficiency and fairness --

You should look at every tax, not just income taxes. We got rid of the income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, employer and employee; we got rid of excise taxes, capital gains, estate taxes, tariffs. And the only ones we left were sin taxes, which are really small. And, in there, said we had two flat rates, one of business net sales, value added, and one on personal unadjusted gross income. If you did that at full employment, you could have a flat tax rate of 11.8 percent and have it statically revenue-neutral, that's it. You end up --

What do we mean when we talk about broadening the base? And the reality is that average Americans, most people -- when they fill out their income taxes, they don't itemize their deductions. The wealthy have a lot of itemized deductions. They take -- I have a lot of tax credits. They use a lot of -- accountants and tax planners who are taking advantage of every single possibility. So, if you are broadening the base in such a way that you are closing some of those opportunities for tax avoidance or tax mitigation, and the net effect is that the wealthy end up paying more than they were paying before, then you are increasing their taxes, and they are, in a sense, generating more revenues. And, if you support that, you don't support tonight's proposition.

There are two things that are on the table being discussed, I think, by tax reformers. One would be some sort of cap on deductions -- that could be a dollar, that could be a percentage of your income. Another would be an approach Bowles-Simpson took, which really cut back a lot on the deductions of affluent people, but left the more in place for moderate income people. Either one of those would get you there.

But let me just say, I think that if you look at the proposition here that we are debating tonight, the proposition is simply that the rich are taxed enough, and what Mark and I have been saying, whether you couch it in terms of closing loopholes, broadening the base, increasing marginal income taxes, doesn't matter how you cook it, the still of the question is given that we have a huge budget deficit, somebody has got to pay a little bit more, even if you do a huge amount of cutting of the budget and cutting spending, you still are going to have to raise some revenues. No matter what your ideology is, you're still going to have to raise some revenues. And if you believe, as I do and as Mark does, that the rich should bear the lion's share of that revenue raising, then you've got to, please, for the good of your children and your grandchildren -- For the good of America, as solid patriots, you have got to vote against this proposition, because it is, in its entirety, given where we are in this country right now, given the challenges we face, this proposition is simply and unalterably ludicrous.

You know, just as Oliver Wendell Holmes famously observed, that paying taxes is actually the price we pay for living in a civilized society. And a civilized society defends itself, it educates its citizens, it cares for those in need, but it's also got to be a society of opportunity and growth, a society of entrepreneurs and businesses, of seeing the fruits of one's own investment in time and in talents, of encouraging investment for tomorrow and not just consumption for today. Tonight Art and I have argued that confiscatory success taxes are wrongheaded, but they're also wrong. I'd ask two questions of our partners tonight. First, what evidence suggests that the economic consequences of higher tax rates on the successful could improve the employment or the income prospects of the rest? And, second, is the nation better off by raising tax rates on high income people or by balancing fairness and prosperity, asking sacrifice from the affluent through the growth consequences of tax reform, and reforming our spending programs to be a safety net? The question at hand tonight is a broad one and an important one. This country has long identified with equality of opportunity. And I worry a lot right now in our country about economic opportunity. I'm fond of an example that illustrates my worry with an image of the nation as a tall building with the bottom flooded out, the penthouse doing fine, and the elevator broken. We could throw rocks at the top or we could fix the elevator. I think most Americans make the latter choice viscerally. And to the points Art and I have made tonight, throwing rocks doesn't fix the elevator, and to torture the analogy, can't pay for it. We need to think about growth and fairness. The case for the proposition tonight is very strong. Tax rates should not rise. The rich are taxed enough.

John, I want to thank you for moderating a great debate. And I really do want to thank Glenn and Art for being good counterweights here. And, Bob, thanks for that great comment. Thank you. I appreciate that. Take that with me. And you're a great guy, too, by the way. Hey, you know, I actually am cheered by our conversation. It sounds like we were hitting each other over the head. To some degree we were mostly about hitting Art over the head. But I think there's a lot of commonality here. I think there's a lot of agreement. I think we agree that our fiscal problems need to be addressed, that these are key to our long term economic success. I think we agree that the distribution of income and wealth is a problem, you know, we're debating a little bit about how we should approach that. But I think we view that as a problem. I think we agree that to address these problems that we do need to cut back on future government spending, that the entitlement programs do need reform, and we do need to think about it in the context of who's going to pay for that reform. The burden of that should probably fall on higher income households. And we agree that we need to generate -- we have to think about the tax side of this. We have to focus on this. But here's where we disagree and that is that we -- Bob and I believe that we need to raise tax revenue, that this has to be a balanced approach to getting us back to something that we would consider appropriate and normal. And I would love to do it through closing deductions and loopholes in the tax code. I think that would be the best way to do it, but we need to be clear eyed about this. And if we can't do it in the way you would like and I would like, we still need to raise the revenue, and we need to raise the revenue by taxing the rich. So you have to vote against this proposition. The rich are not taxed enough.

The rich are taxed enough|i2Debates/102412 taxes.p|318|R4|ARTHUR LAFFER|for|2|3|1|0|0|12|0|14|0|0|2|3|28|13|0|7|4|0|0|1|0|80|4|0|0|0|0|2|8|0|1|3|10|0|13|2|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|7|17|14|18|3|12|0|0|0|0|0|10|5|0|2|0|3|21|0|9|5|7|140|Thank you. First of all, I'd like to congratulate Bob and Mark for trying to change the proposition to get a different one. The question is tax rates and, frankly, what Glenn have been arguing are, why would you ever want to raise tax rates on the rich if you know it's going to give you less revenue and a less prosperous economy? It's as simple as that and the evidence out there documents that time and time again. One of the ways I would do is lowering tax rates, but doing it by broadening the tax base to keep revenue neutral but creating the growth, prosperity, which would give higher revenues, but with lower rates. If you believe in lower rates and a broader base, you must vote for the proposition that the rich are taxed enough. Thank you.

And that concludes our closing statements. And now it is time to learn which side you feel argued best. We're going to ask you again for your second vote, to go to the keypad at each of your seats. Our motion is: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. At this point, if you agree with that motion after everything you've heard, push number one on your keypad. If you disagree, push number two. If you are, became, remain, undecided, push number three. And we will have the results in about a minute and a half. I think the system is still open so, has anybody not voted? Everybody's good. All right. While we're waiting for those results to come, the first thing I want to say is that this was a really, really, real pleasure to listen to this debate. The way the four of you brought your game to this, a lot of humor, a lot of respect, actually, for one another. It's what we like to do, and I want to thank all of you for doing it. I'd also like to thank everybody who got up to ask a question, including the questions that didn't get used. It takes a lot of nerve to get up and do it. And some of the questions were brilliant and on targets. And the others were just darn interesting. No, seriously, just not exactly where we wanted to take the discussion tonight. So everybody who got up and asked questions, thanks very much. Give them a round of applause. And, finally, in terms of thanks, we want to thank, again, the Richmond Center for their participation tonight and in making all of this possible. Thank you to them. We encourage you to talk about this debate; talk to your friends, tweet about it, blog about it. Our twitter handle is @IQ2US. The hashtag is actually #taxdebate. I think earlier I said our hashtag was #IQ2US, that would work, too, but #taxdebate is what we're looking for tonight. We have our next debate coming up next month, it will be on November 14. The motion, the proposition, that we will be arguing is Legalize Drugs. For the motion, we have Paul Butler. He is a professor at Georgetown Law School; he is also a former federal prosecutor. His partner is Nick Gillespie -- he is one of America's foremost libertarians, and he is also editor in Chief of reason.com and Reason TV. Against the motion, Theodore Dalrymple. He is a retired prison doctor and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. And Asa Hutchinson, who is a former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the first undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. We have tickets for that debate on November 14 and for our December 5 debate, which is Science Refutes God, available on our website. The website is www.iq2us.org. We would love to see all of you and we were delighted that we sold out and we love selling out, so help us do that. Well, that doesn't sound right. Don't -- We don't want to sell out. We would like to sell all of our tickets. If you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, and also if you want to see this one again, there are a lot of ways that you can catch this one and the upcoming ones. We have a livestream on FORA.tv and then the debate lives on that site for some time. You can also, as I said earlier, listen to these debates on NPR, that's WNYC right here in New York City. Or watch them on WNET and the World Digital channel. Okay. So, you have listened to the arguments for and against on this motion: The Rich Are Taxed Enough. We had you vote once before the debate and once again afterwards on where you stand on this motion. Here are the results. The teams whose numbers will have changed the most will be declared our winner. Before the debate 28 percent were for the motion, 49 percent against, and 23 percent undecided. After the debate, 30 percent are for the motion, that's up 2 percent. Sixty-three percent are against. That is up 14 percent. Seven percent are undecided, but this means the vote goes for the team arguing against the motion. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donovan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

And what Robert does -- what Bob does is he frames for us, just in a couple of minutes, what the stakes are in this debate and what's -- what are -- the validity of the arguments on both sides. So let's start, Bob, just by asking why this debate now?
Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|3|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|0|6|0|0|0|4|0|7|0|0|4|1|12|7|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|38|0|0|0|0|0|0|5|0|0|0|8|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|8|8|8|2|10|0|0|0|0|0|0|6|0|0|0|0|8|0|0|0|4|62|Well, it's very timely because, of course, Colorado and Washington have just passed referenda legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. Now, this topic is broader than marijuana. This is about all kinds of recreational drugs. But it's timely for that reason, and it's also timely because in recent years, both the left and the right have coalesced around the pro motion position.

And we'd be better off placing reliance on treatment, on rehabilitation, on education. That the costs of creating a criminal industry are huge, not only the obvious costs of enforcement, of prison, but we create a situation in which the leading role models in inner city communities are drug dealers in which a disproportionate number of black youth languish away in prisons.

In many cases, kids get hooked on drugs well before they reach the age of being able to make reasoned choices. And it's just simply not a matter where you can have a libertarian idea that this is -- that this is individual, because it affects so much else in society.

And I just want to invite one more round of applause for Bob Rosenkranz for making this possible. We call it a war, and for 41 years, we have been fighting it, a war on drugs. The estimated costs so far, about 2.5 trillion dollars. The results so far, mixed. So what does it say that voters in Colorado and Washington state recently went to the ballot box and decided to legalize one of the drugs we've been fighting all of these years, weed, pot, marijuana. What is that, is it treason, or is it a facing up to a certain social reality? Is this war worth continuing to fight on? And if so, what direction do we take it in? Those are a lot of questions. But they all boil down to the one that we're going to be debating here tonight. And here it is: Yes or no to this statement, legalize drugs. That is the motion on the table. A debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan.

We go in three rounds. Then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one side wins. Meeting our debaters, on the side arguing for the motion, legalize drugs, Paul Butler, professor of law at Georgetown and former federal prosecutor. His partner, Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of reason.com and reason TV. The motion, "Legalize Drugs," arguing against, Asa Hutchinson, CEO of the Hutchinson Group and former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. And his partner, Theodore Dalrymple, a retired prison doctor, now a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Our motion is "Legalize drugs. " Let's talk with our debaters as they come to the stage. Paul Butler, you are a Georgetown law professor. You are arguing for the motion, "Legalize drugs. " After Harvard Law you clerked for a judge. You worked in corporate law. You then became a federal prosecutor and worked for the Department of Justice. But then something happened that made you give it all up, and it changed the way you thought about the criminal justice system. What was that?
Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|12|R1|PAUL BUTLER|for|1|3|0|0|0|7|0|5|0|0|0|2|5|3|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|42|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|2|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|6|0|0|3|9|3|5|3|7|0|0|0|0|0|1|4|0|1|0|3|9|0|1|0|5|68|So somebody forgot to tell the police about all those credentials. And I got arrested for a crime I didn't commit. It was when I had the most high profile case as a prosecutor, I was prosecuting a U.S. senator, and, again, I got locked up. You can read all about it in the first chapter of my book, "Let's Get Free, a Hip-Hop Theory of Justice. "

You -- in prison you specialized in cases involving drug offenders, and you came away from that experience thinking that we have the relationship between crime and drugs wrong. In what way, Theodore?

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Paul Butler, and I represent the people. When I was a prosecutor, that's how I would start my opening statements. I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and tonight I'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure. Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and made us all less free. And he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look like. Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine? Nick will tell you about the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs. As a prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren't making a dent in the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe. I was prosecuting a lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses. Locking up these young people with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing school for criminals. When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really good bad guys. If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer. Maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that. No country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs. The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world. We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. It costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs now as it always has been. What about drug addicts? It turns out that the small percentage of people who use drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than punishment for those people. Most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right? If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence. But is the answer to make using alcohol a crime? Of course not. We tried that during Prohibition and it just did not work. All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we don't stop anybody now from using drugs. So I'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and also, my life experience. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real. Like most Americans, I have used illegal drugs. I wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed. The first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went to college. And then at Harvard, where I went to law school. I'm glad I never got caught when I smoked pot, and I'm also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana. My opponents are honorable men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach. As you listen to the good doctor Theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind. He has actually prescribed heroin to addicts. He did it because he knows that addicts need to be treated, not punished. As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is a medical issue, not a crime. And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he's a wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan. And I wonder what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and said she was using cocaine. Would he really say, "Wait a minute, honey," and whisper to his wife, "Quick, dial 911, tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked up. " Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends. So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans. We call it a war on drugs but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked. Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino. That's not who really uses drugs. The National Institute of Health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any other group. They're about 12 percent of drug users. What about sellers? Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race. White kids in Scarsdale, they dont have to go to the hood to buy. They get their weed and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale. But who gets locked up for drug crimes? Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 60 percent of people who do the time. And that's selective prosecution, and it's devastated the African-American community. We have one black president and one million black people in prison. The book "The New Jim Crow" tells us that because of the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850. Think about the catastrophic effect that has on families. In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside. So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to not punish people for using drugs. The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this is just a nice rhetorical debate. The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they will never be touched by the criminal justice system. The odds for African-American children are very different. And that just seems profoundly unfair. My friends, as a civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick. We shouldn't put anybody in a cage based on what they put in their mouths. There's a better way. It's to legalize drugs.

What an exciting evening to debate an important subject for our country and for our future. Paul, great job in your opening remarks. An African-American who also happens to be in a leadership position in the United States attended the summit of the Americas in Colombia, South America. He said it is okay for us to debate the pros and cons of the war on drugs. But, quote, "I personally, in my administration, position is that legalization is not the answer," end quote. That was President Barack Obama. I happen to agree with President Barack Obama. I agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce our laws. I agree that we need to have a robust debate about incarceration policies and what we are doing in our fight against illegal drugs and how much we're devoting to rehabilitation. All of those issues are appropriate to be on the table. So there needs to be changes. Paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement. That's why I have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powder cocaine disparity that impacts racially across America. We've reduced that disparity. We've made a correction to the system. We need to reduce our incarceration rates. That's why I'm engaged on the Right on Crime initiative and initiatives that encourage our state legislatures to look at incarceration policies. And in Texas and in Arkansas and in South Carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both to save money, but also to reexamine our policies. I believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration. That's why I've been a supporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that it can be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across America. So why -- why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer? Perhaps he understood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that drug use has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country. Did he want to preside -- and I know people -- I see some skeptical looks when I say that. That is in your program. That is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years, drug use has been cut in half in our country. And we have a president that says he does not want to see it go up on his watch. Could it be that he does not believe that the United States ought to break its treaty obligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe? And that is reason enough to vote against the proposition. Or perhaps he was thinking about his own daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them to be engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in -- whenever we continue to have it illegal in our country? And so the president made that decision both personally, he said, and with his administration. Let's look at the argument that's been presented. And first, I would say I've been introduced as a former administrator of the DEA. That is absolutely true. I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that's prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of traffickers. And my experience is just the opposite of Paul. In fact, when I went into a store recently to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "You put me in prison. " I thought I was going to be thrown out of the place. But he looked at me, and he said, "I wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down the wrong path of addiction. I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it turned me around. " And today he owns his own business. And so I've had a totally different experience as former federal prosecutor. They say the current model of prohibition is not working. Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does not pass muster in close examination. In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years. Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed, what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty today? Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop fighting hunger? Of course not. Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology. I believe it is an effort to save lives. It is our youth. It is our families, it is our communities at stake. How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community? Is it by legalization or is it by our present method of saying, let's improve the system. Let's make it better. But let's don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything legal. Secondly, they talk about harm. If you believe that addictive and mind-altering drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that they are harmful, then ask this question. If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs? Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate. But if you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease usage? Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics today than you do people who are drug addicts. But did ending prohibition on alcohol increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America? And if you increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it? They cannot show -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and over history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go down. That has not been the experience in the Netherlands. It's not been the experience in the United Kingdom. It's not been the experience in Alaska. It has not been the experience in Canada. Usage has gone up. And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family. Well, if my children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they getting those drugs? What is the availability? How can we shut that down? And as a parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability, increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as acceptable in our society as alcohol. That creates a problem as a parent in my mind.

I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, "Legalize drugs. " You have heard two of the opening statements, and now on to the third, debating in support of the motion, "Legalize Drugs," the editor-in-chief of Reason.com and Reason TV, he's the author of "The Declaration of Independents," T-S, and described as one of the foremost libertarians in America. Ladies and gentlemen, Nick Gillespie.

I do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in America means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that's basically it. So, you know, you've heard from a self described soldier in the drug war. You've heard from a general, a commander, former Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in the drug war. You'll hear from a medic in the drug war. I present myself simply as a conscientious objector in the war on drugs. Let me explain a bit of why I think we should legalize drugs. And the first -- I want to make two large points. First is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by Christmas. This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he's saying, "Look, you know, it's been working pretty well these past 30 years. Drug use is down. If we get rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up. " So I want to talk about that. And then I want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you. And, first and foremost, I want to make this statement. And half of you in this audience, if you are representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference. You know, using drugs is not immoral. It is not addictive for 99 percent of people. And there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it. Look, any program -- it's not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people. Any program that has such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions. As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John mentioned at the beginning of the program. And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of thousands of people a year in jail are justified. Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you'll remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a war it doesn't like -- Mark Perry, an economist at AEI, has pointed out that between 1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat. In other words, we have become the world's largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes. The only other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going forward. Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and minds. A recent Rasmussen poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs. A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate. It doesn't make things better, it makes everything worse. Despite attempts to control -- to stem the supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation adjusted price goes down. As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders while they have to let rapists and murderers out. The Rand Corporation and other think tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards drugs and use rate. So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates. In places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates. It's not clear what's going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more willing to come forward before they developed problems. So, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, also known as the loyal opposition here. Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America's longest war. I want to make a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies. And here is where I go into the meth round, because I'm running out of time. This should be recognized. Pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic right. Over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all believe in what DuPont used to advertise as "better living through chemistry. " We take drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods. None of this is going away, nor should it. We do all sorts of things to make ourselves look and feel better. To the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better. Ladies and gentlemen, if we don't have the right, literally, to change our mind through our personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn? Now, drug legalization is not a scary prospect. It's not the radical change that its champions claim not its opponents fear. And let me -- as I'm winding down, how many of you have tried an illegal drug? Raise your hand. Anybody carrying? And if so -- okay. I'll talk to you later.

For use, not carrying, okay. Because otherwise I think I see Asa hitting "911" under the table. Look, according to government statistics, fully 47 percent of Americans over the age of 12 have done so. A population that includes, at least, the last three presidents of the United States, which, granted, may constitute the strongest argument against using drugs -- -- but drug use is a normal phenomenon, very few people become addicts. So when we are talking about what drug legalization would look like, first off, it's all marijuana use. Vanishingly small people -- percentage of people use drugs other than marijuana. But let me just say, I'll close with -- there's not a single dimension across which pot is more dangerous than alcohol, which is pretty much all you need to know about a post- prohibition American society. It would be a lot like today, except that you would have one or two more choices in your medicine cabinet, and about 400,000 fewer people a year would go to jail; police would be able to focus on actual criminals and Monday mornings would be a lot easier to face. So, please, think about legalizing drugs. Thank you.

And that's our motion, legalize drugs. And now, our final debater speaking against this motion, Theodore Dalrymple. He's a retired doctor who practiced in an inner-city hospital and a prison. He's also a prolific writer and he's a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Ladies and gentlemen, Theodore Dalrymple.
Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|39|R2|THEODORE DALRYMPLE|against|4|41|17|1|0|64|1|87|4|0|13|7|124|61|4|19|29|0|0|0|0|504|11|4|2|0|2|2|37|0|0|2|57|5|2|8|14|5|1|6|40|4|8|29|116|48|93|21|72|0|0|2|0|6|44|39|0|22|9|17|111|6|1|5|43|842|Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or , or methamphetamine, or heroine, or LSD, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms would be eliminated and very much reduced. And, incidentally, Portugal has not legalized drugs, and no country has. Anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from illegality. In this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning as from homicide. Those people -- opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs obtained perfectly legally. About 15,000 a year die of these drugs. But the supply and demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years. And it was all nice and above board. There are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as I said, created perfectly legally. And this is all within a decade, more or less a decade. Now, I suppose that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is. And if only the drugs were really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all would be well. Well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that proposition. This example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous demand. Another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called buprenorphine which is used very widely in France in the treatment of heroin addicts. And it's diverted to Georgia. That's the ex-Soviet Union republic of Georgia. According to the Lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from France, which again shows quite apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous demand. Our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally available in -- to the Georgians, none of this would have happened. In Scotland, as a whole, and in Dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone, first developed to help the late Hermann Goering to get through the war without withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin. And this drug is used in supposed treatment of heroin addiction. So the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal drug. So it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality. We've seen that even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal to deaths from that trade. And that demand was created very, very quickly. It's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality of drugs. And again, this is not so. In the prison in which I worked, I discovered that the heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed -- they had committed between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took heroin. Therefore, it will be more true to say that they were addicts because they were criminal than that they were criminal because they were addicts. This has been found elsewhere. And research shows that criminality is a better predictor of addiction than is addiction of criminality. And this can be seen from the career of the writer William S. Burroughs, with which you might be familiar, who, as you know, shot his wife dead. He -- in my opinion, he was an even worse writer than he was a husband. But we don't have any time for literary criticism. The point is that he was fascinated by crime and committed criminal acts well before he became an addict. In the hospital in which I worked, I once walked into the intensive care unit to find two drug dealers who had shot each other at close quarters, but with thorough British incompetence, had failed to kill one another. Well, what do you suppose that such people would be doing if they were not shooting at one another? Would they have been doing remedial teaching, for example, or deciphering cuneiform script in the British museum? It's absurd. And criminal -- criminal gangs are not going to file for bankruptcy if drugs are legalized. They're going to change their activities. So making the importation or production, distribution, and sale of drugs would be dangerous, and it would not have the claimed benefits because the illegality of drugs is the occasion and not the cause of crime. And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote against the motion.

Round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience. We have two teams of two arguing out this motion: "Legalize Drugs. " The team arguing for the motion, Paul Butler and Nick Gillespie are arguing -- you've heard them say that basically partly it's a freedom thing that grownups have the right to put what they want in their own bodies as they do with the drug called alcohol. A lesson in history that criminalizing a drug is actually going to backfire. But beyond that, they say that the war on drugs, the embodiment of drugs as illegal costs in too many ways without a resulting drop in crime significantly, and that it disproportionately hits the African-American community in terms of people getting locked up behind bars simply for possession of drugs. The team arguing for the motion, Asa Hutchinson and Theodore Dalrymple, they're saying you cannot say that the war on drugs has failed, not when drug use among Americans has dropped 50 percent in 30 years. They also point to the fact that drugs and crime and addiction go together. They point to prescription drugs, for example, which are legal. But their use is mired in crime and addiction. Those are some of the arguments we've heard presented. And we're going to work through some of them in more detail now. And I want to go first to the team arguing against the motion to legalize drugs. Your opponents have made the claim that the war on drugs as constructed really is a war on young black kids, that it is -- that the number of kids who are put in jail for drug possession, mere drug possession is just disproportionately high and has had terrible consequences on the community. And I want to know, does your side concede or refute that basic claim? Asa Hutchinson?

I think there was a disparity in penalties that impacted our African-American community when it came to crack and powder cocaine. We made a huge step forward. Congress passed a remedy to that. I think there's been some challenges with the mandatory minimums that's made -- we've made some corrections in that as well. But you look at methamphetamine, it's such a huge problem across all of the Midwest. That's predominantly a Caucasian drug. It -- and that's where the law enforcement is enforcing its efforts right now. So I don't concede the point at all. But I think we -- you look at the African-American communities, and we have significant amount in Arkansas. We have high poverty rates. We have high unemployment rates right now. We have many social problems that are impacted by the community. And it is reflected also in what happens in the drug world.

It's just not true. Asa makes it sound like blacks use drugs more than anybody else. And as anyone who's been to college or high school knows, it's simply not true. We really shouldn't be talking about legalizing drugs. We should be talking about re- legalizing them. For most of our history, drugs have been perfectly legal. You can go into a drugstore in the 1800s and buy opium. Coca-Cola started out with a cocaine derivative in it. So what made them become illegal? Nothing to do with public safety. It was all about race. First drug criminalized, opium. San Francisco, 1890, the concern was that Chinamen were using it to seduce white women, can trace it right down the line. Marijuana, Mexican field hands. It was making them lazy. With blacks, it was that Coke and ice. Negroes were running rampant in the South. So our war on drugs is about race through and through. It always has been, and it is right now.

Paul, you made -- drew a distinction between treating addiction and punishing addiction, which suggests that perhaps unlike your partner you're talking about addiction as a problem that needs to be addressed by society. Do you split with each other on that? Do you think that it's this -- in other words, are you saying drug use is a problem?

So most people are able to use marijuana and other drugs recreationally and go to work the next day. Most people are also able to do that with alcohol. For the percentage of people who have substance abuse problems with it, we know, the good doctor knows, that's a health issue. Police, prosecutors, they make lousy doctors. Jailers make even worse doctors. So the way to treat that problem, the way to heal those people is to use what we know about, and not what we know about locking people up, because what we know about locking people up is, it doesn't work.

It's only to a very small extent a medical problem. I mean, there are medical consequences, of course, but this is not what is important. For example, everything -- I think that everything you think about heroin addiction is actually wrong. For example, you probably think that withdrawal effects from heroin are very severe, they're not, they're trivial. And the overwhelming evidence is that, by far, the most suffering from withdrawal effects is psychologically induced; it's anticipatory anxiety, it isn't the -- and there's good experimental evidence about this. You think that its highly addictive, it isn't. Most heroin addicts go at it for about a year before they're ever actually addicted. You think that there's a connection -- I've described the supposed connection between crime and addiction. The idea is that an addict goes out to obtain money in order for his addiction; there's no correlation in the amount of crime he commits and the amount of drugs he takes. And, actually, you find that they're all acquisitive criminals before they ever take heroin.

Maybe that's the wrong word. But we've heard a few references to alcohol and to prohibition and to the notion that, I think, nobody is disputing that alcohol is a drug on the panel, and the nation did try, amended the Constitution, to outlaw alcohol consumption and decided it was a mistake. So, tonight everybody in the room can go afterwards and enjoy a glass of wine or a beer. What's the difference between alcohol and the prescribed drugs?

In our democracy, we make decisions on which ones to legalize and which ones not to. Those are decisions that are made. The debate question tonight, though, of course, is legalizing all drugs. And, again, I go back to the question, which relates to ending prohibition in the late 1920s. You ended prohibition on alcohol, use went up, availability went up, regulation went up, taxation went up, and you compare that to legalizing methamphetamine. You're going to have an opportunity for the state to regulate methamphetamine producers, you're going to have it available, because it's going to be legal, and it's going to be taxed, and so, the price will be set by the market place, which is regulated and taxed. And so, the question is, "Will you end crime? Will you end the cartels? Will you end the black market because you regulate methamphetamine? " Of course not. There's going to be those that don't want to pay the taxes, just like they don't want to pay the taxes on cigarettes, and there's going to be a black market there, and you're going to have enforcement efforts, you're going to have criminals out there that are still bypassing the law, and so all of your hope of ending the DEA or ending law enforcement will not happen with legalization.

When we're talking addiction or substance abuse -- you know, I don't drink anymore, because I was a bad drinker; I tried my hardest to drink and drink and drink, I gave it up. If I had to admit that I was a criminal as well as having a substance abuse problem, I doubt that I would've gotten there quite as fast as I did, which was long enough.

The murder rate in Mexico is now between a third and quarter of what it was in the 1940s. That might surprise you, but it is a fact. When we look at the murder rate during prohibition, it is, of course, perfectly true that it went up during prohibition. It went up by 35 percent. And it came down after prohibition was ended. But in the same period before prohibition, the murder rate went up by 85 percent. And in six years between 1900 and 1906, the murder rates in this country went up by 325 percent. So I think that the relationship between violent crime and prohibition is probably not nearly as close as people imagine and that there was a secular trend in which it went up anyway. And you could even make the case that it slowed the rise in the murder rate. I wouldn't make that case. But it's not straight -- it's not as straight forward -- the world did not begin in 1919. And the murder rate went up both absolutely and relatively more before -- in the years before prohibition than during prohibition. And incidentally, Scarface got his scar before prohibition. And he didn't get it from plastic surgery.

We have to ask if that's true, is it worth it? The costs have been 2.5 million people in prison, the costs have been one in three young black men with a criminal case, more African-American young men in prison than in college. The cost has been billions of dollars that we can't afford, money away from our schools, away from our healthcare system, going straight to prison. So especially if we understand that those are people who are locked up for using drugs. I don't have a problem. If you steal, if you rob, then yes, you should be punished. But when we're thinking about people who are locked up, 500,000 people, those are nonviolent drug offenders. And again, entirely selective. They're African-American and Latino two-thirds of them. There're some states where 80 to 90 percent of the people in prison for drug crimes are black. And we know that's not the reality of who's using drugs. That's selective law enforcement.

But in terms -- if you look at Oxycontin, it's a white abused drug. If you look at LSD, it's a white abused drug. If you look at cocaine, it's -- you know, crack cocaine has minorities. You've got powder cocaine, that's white abused. You've got heroin that's across the board. You've got GHB, you've got ecstasy that was mentioned. So I just don't see the racial component to it. Obviously, I think as head of the -- former head of the DEA, we looked at enforcement policy. You've got to be careful. You don't want to -- the south side of Chicago put all your enforcement resources on the crack distributor when you're ignoring the white guy coming from the suburb. That's wrong enforcement policies. You've got to balance those. But those are remedies within the current system. Legalizing it dramatizes the problem. You still have education issues, as you pointed out, where you have to spend dollars on education, probably even more because you've got more availability out there. You're going to have to spend money on the regulatory side. So all of those issues that are concerned about in society will only increase if you increase legalization.

But I'm left wondering what world we're talking about here. So they're talking about how bad Oxycontin is. Oxycontin is a prescription drug that is already legal and regulated. I don't see how that really has a lot to do with talking about a legalization debate. It's already legal. And here are the stats that are important. The government runs something called the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. And basically, 30 -- in the past month use, they ask people, have you used this drug in the past 30 days, which is kind of a proxy for, you know, a regular user or a casual user. About 7 percent of people over the ages of 12 -- 12-year-olds by the way, you know almost a hundred percent, they say yes to everything. But about 7 percent of Americans say that they've used pot in the past month. That by far -- by a factor of three or more, that's the most widely used illegal drug, or legal drug that's used illegally. The next one is opioids, the prescription drugs that Theodore was talking about, which comes in at 2.7 percent. When you're talking about things like meth and heroin, one- tenth of one percent. Hallucinogens covering a wide range of things, five-tenths of one percent. Crack or cocaine, including crack, six-tenths of one percent. These are nonfactors. And as Paul was suggesting, if they're made legal, who out here is going to be like, finally, heroin is legal, you know? You know, let's go. Let's try it. No. Okay, that's not going to happen. It's about pot. And we all know that pot is not a dangerous drug, that pot is not a gateway anymore than mother's milk, you know, is the ultimate gateway drug because everybody who uses heroin started out with mother's milk. But it's about pot, and we need to focus on that.

And 2 million people being addicted to it. So it is actually an important point that if you make something readily available, the use of it can increase catastrophically. Now, I can't, of course, say, that I know for a fact if methamphetamine were just available like everything else, or crack were available, you just went down and got it, of course not everybody would take it. But I have an experience. And this was an experience working in Africa with some expatriates. And for various reasons I won't go into, alcohol became -- virtually free of charge. And the result was absolutely catastrophic. The increase in the consumption was enormous. And, of course, not -- in fact, the majority of people didn't take it to extremes. But 20 percent of people did.

I think logic tells you usage goes up. But recent information, Alaska, through a court case, decriminalized marijuana in the 70s. Usage went up. Parents were concerned, and they voted to recriminallize it in the '90s. That's a historic experience among our states. And so usage did go up, and parents recognized that and reversed the trend in Alaska. This debate is not about marijuana. It is drugs, plural. And to be consistent in your philosophy of libertarianism, which my colleagues are consistent, they recognize it doesn't do any good to legalize one. You have to legalize all. And if you -- because that's the only way you're going to change the environment of enforcement, to change the environment of police and so on. And so the debate tonight is about legalizing all drugs.

Paul Butler mentioned smoking, and I have a question, the laws in New York have gotten so much more stringent against smoking. You can't smoke in the parks, you certainly cannot smoke in a restaurant or a bar, and taxes on cigarettes have gone up significantly. So your argument would be that none of that affects people lowering the smoking rate, that, in fact, it's only health issues, and I would wonder what the statistics are on that.

So if we buy this idea that people aren't responsible enough to make intelligent decisions for themselves, which my opponents don't seem to think people are, we ought to be concerned about these draconian laws, and we ought to especially be concerned about who they're going to be applied against. I guarantee you that white people -- very few white people in New York are going to be arrested for smoking in parks. It's going to be African-Americans and Latinos. That's the reality. We can't divorce the reality from this rhetoric.

They didn't suddenly realize that their health would be impaired by it. And interestingly, this happened throughout the world. My wife, who's French, said, "The French will never obey this law," but they obeyed it like lambs. And so -- and the reason, of course, is that smoking doesn't have the antinomian cultural meaning that taking drugs has, and that's why smokers will obey the law and others won't.

I'd like to understand a bit more, Mr. Hutchinson, the comments you made about that we can't legalize one without essentially legalizing them all, that it's not useful. But historically we have legalized one very major one, and that is alcohol. And then we have a -- sort of a regulation as well with cigarettes. And then there are the various legal drugs that doctors can give you. We've already gone down that path, and we've seen that, for instance, the legalization of alcohol didn't cause a tremendous explosion in heroin use. Why wouldn't legalizing just one more, say, going with heroin, that's a -- not heroin, but -- -- but going with marijuana -- -- got to pick the right one. Why wouldn't going one step further and thus removing the tremendous amount of people who are in jail for that and all the money that's going to the criminals , why wouldn't that be used --

And you're right. We're a democracy so you could -- society could choose to legalize heroin if you wish or marijuana and pick one of them. But my argument would be generally people say, "Well, one of the reason we need to legalize, because you got to put the cartels out of business. And you've got to put the criminal elements out of business. " Well, they're smart business folks, and they have diversified. So if you legalize marijuana, they're going to trade in cocaine, methamphetamine, and they will market those. And so if -- unless you legalize everything, the cartels are just happy as a lark. And even if you legalized everything, you're probably still going to have the black market they will deal in although it'll be tougher. But the second point is simply that the debate topic is not just about marijuana, it is broad based legalization because -- well, that's the debate topic. And that's what we're trying to stick to.

Is -- in other words, where is the social dimension to that use?

And so it's a child welfare issue that is extraordinarily harmful, endangerment of those. It is environmentally unsafe. Now, you can say, "Well, if we get our nanny state involved where they regulate the -- and license the methamphetamine produces maybe you'll eliminate some of that. " But you're still going to have the lack of productivity in the workplace through drug use, and people not showing up because of they arent having a good Monday morning, as my colleague was pointing out.

And that's the goal in the workplace too. If you do testing and you find a worker who has got an abuse problem, they're not sending them to the police, they're sending them to treatment. And that's the objective of the employers, and that's working well in the workplace. And all of that effort would be abandoned if you went through legalization. All of the sudden, you -- why would you drug test anybody?

And what airline, what airline or trucking company, or whatever, is not going to regularly test people, because it puts them at enormous insurance risk? These things are handled and -- to talk about another market mechanism, we don't need -- and this is the libertarian in me speaking, we don't need the government to test and testify to the purity of methamphetamine, we will have fair trade methamphetamine -- -- you know, private certification agencies, just like with coffee or biodynamic wine or organic foods -- -- will spontaneously spring into being. And, just to follow up on one point, the reason why I'm stressing marijuana, it goes back to some things that Paul is saying, and I don't think that the other side is fully acknowledging, which is that we live in a world where school kids tell everybody who asks them, "You know, you can get drugs easier than you can get beer, any kind of drug you want. " The use ratios are pot, very much--much less, prescription drugs, and these tiny vanishing statistical errors of things like heroin. Even if you double or triple the heroin use, it goes from -- one-tenth of 1 percent to three- tenths of 1 percent. I don't think that's a reason to hold everyone else hostage who can act responsibly.

Those are two very separate things, and we can deal with them. But when you see your parents having a glass of wine with dinner and acting responsibly around an intoxicant, you learn a very strong lesson there that is going to be much more beneficial to you than if you grow up in a teetotaler house and then you have the unfortunate experience of going to Yale and Harvard like Paul here.

But in drug- related violence, we've had, you know -- it's just been atrocious. My question is, legalizing drugs would do better for cartel violence or worse?

And if we listen to the leaders of the Latin American countries, they're calling for more responsible drug policies, including for us to consider legalization, because they know that the violence is sparked by the illegal market which is sparked by the enormous demand for drugs from the United States. So if we get rid of that illegal market, including by having drugs regulated like we regulate tobacco and alcohol now, we'll get rid of the violence. Again, that's exactly what happened during prohibition. Al Capone wasn't nothing but a drive-by shooter. And again, when we got rid of that illegal market, we got rid of the violence.

Did the mafia end in New York City at the conclusion of prohibition? Rudy Giuliani, the former U.S. attorney, former mayor of New York, made himself famous by prosecuting the mob and the mafia. They existed long after the ending of prohibition. And to the lady's question about Mexico, do you think the legalization of drugs will put the cartel out of business? It might make them adjust, but there is alien smuggling which they're engaged in now. There's other activities. But you look at the cost to the United States, I think that would just be enormous. I met with president Vicente Fox whenever he was president. He was concerned not only about the cartels. He was concerned about the demand -- growing demand problem and usage in Mexico of his people. And that was a concern there. And so it's not just about the cartel. It's about drug use. I don't know of any Latin American country that wants to legalize all of the drugs, heroin, cocaine, down the road.

And to the extent that the cartels in Mexico might move into human trafficking, the fix there is to legalize immigration, not to try and wipe out cartels. That's what I'm saying. And the -- you know, the -- or the generational shift here might be the Kennedy clan. And I say this as a half Italian, half Irish, so I've got, you know, a foot in each camp here.

If one just takes the example of Colombia, there were two episodes in the 20th century in which the equivalent pro rata of the population of more than a million people were killed. That's twice. And the current civil war in Colombia started in 1964. I remember in 1979, really before the drug business, I remember looking -- looking in the South American handbook which was the kind of book that everyone used in -- who traveled in South America and it said of Bogota -- and I'm quoting from memory, so it might not be quite right. It said, "Try to look poor. Do not carry anything. Do not wear any jewelry. And if you can see without them, do not wear glasses. " Now, let's say you wouldn't have that in a guide book to Switzerland. I mean, more likely, you'd have, "Do not flush the lavatory after 10:00 because you'll be arrested for disturbing the peace. " And that's not a joke, incidentally. So the idea that these are -- I mean, I've seen another thing that --

But the Dutch governments had second thoughts after years of expanding the cannabis cafes. I think they realized that it became a tourist Mecca for that purpose, and what you just described. And so the number of Dutch marijuana coffee houses dropped from almost 1,200 in 1997 to 782. And so they decreased maybe -- I don't think the -- I think the Dutch government -- and in fact many of them -- 73 percent of the Dutch towns do not allow cannabis cafes. And so I think it was a mistake, the path that they went down. They recognized it. They've retreated from that both in terms of their reputation in the commercial enterprise but also I just think it's the direction that the Dutch towns did not want to go down. So I hope we can learn something from that. You talk about availability because it was available. I was actually going through a Dutch town with the chief of police, and I had people pulling on my sleeves -- I'm with the chief of police. I'm head of the DEA. And they're pulling on my sleeve saying, "Do you want some Ecstasy? " and I'm saying, "Hey, don't you know who I am, who I'm with? " And it doesn't make any difference, because it was available and was legal.

It turned out in Amsterdam, when they made smoking pot legal, fewer kids wanted to do it. It wasn't as cool. So, respectfully, Dr. Theodore and Asa, if you really want kids to stop smoking pot, you should go on TV yourselves and fire up a big juicy blunt.

Tom Glassman writes, "Im someone who lives in Washington State. " He asks, "Is the legalization of a drug, for example, marijuana, something that should be left to the states to decide?

I would actually -- I guess it's the second best answer to say that drug legalization should be left to localities or to states as opposed to a one size fits all federal solution. By the same token, I do actually think that pharmacological freedom, which includes what a friend of mine calls culinary freedom -- I mean, the right to ingest what you want is pretty fundamental and should probably be respected across the board rather than parceled out, but as a second best option, let's let the states and localities be laboratories of democracy --

Doctors in the medical profession should determine what's appropriate pain management and care. At this point, the AMA has not approved that. Maybe they will someday, but they have not done that at this point. And so that's the answer. I don't think that relates to the overall debate question, but it's certainly an appropriate question to ask.

You just said that you don't feel that that question relates to the motion, and you've said that a few times on a few questions. Why not? Why not, for example, the question of medical marijuana?

Some states put medical marijuana on the ballot, which takes a doctor's prescription or authorization, and so that's not a legalization issue, it is a physician issue and pain management and doctor's care, and giving doctors the ability to prescribe marijuana if they believe that's beneficial, so it's really a separate medical issue versus the legalization across the board. You can decide they need it for pain management, that doesn't need mean that everybody should have marijuana.

I personally believe that it's the result of all of our community efforts combined. But the point is, you're not going to ever eliminate 100 percent usage of illegal drugs and addicting drugs. And the reason is we have young people, we have addictive personalities. The question is, what is the best way to keep the usage and the abuse at the lowest point for our society? And I think the present mechanisms, while we can tweak it, we can adjust it, we can change our enforcement policies, has worked pretty good in terms of keeping it -- a 9 percent level of use in the last 30 days for all of Americans. That's making some progress.

Today, as I prepared for this debate, I received a call from a family friend in Arkansas who is a grown mother, actually has two 30-year-old girls, and she said both of them are on methamphetamine and she simply asked, "What do I do about it? " And so I started asking questions, and one of them actually knew she had a problem and wants to get off; the other one just is going down this path, she's got a supplier, she's got a dealer. And, of course, I started thinking through, "How does legalization impact this very real tragedy that is destroying this home and this family? " And one of the 30 year old daughters has children being neglected. And I could not think of a system of legalization that would make this better, because this person that has a problem will never get the treatment necessary in order to get over that addiction unless they're confronted with it, and probably from a legal standpoint. It is that officer that will say, "Ma'am, you've got methamphetamine in your car. You need to get help. We're going to arrest you, or you're going to go to drug court. Something's going to happen. And that will change their life. Now, if it's not illegal, all that officer can do is say, ma'am, we're going to have to take your children away from you. But you've got a right to keep your methamphetamine. You've got a right to go get some more. You've got a right to continue your abuse pattern. And this could be multiplied over and over again. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about legalizing drugs. If you send a signal to our youth of our nation, the next generation, as President Barack Obama wants to do, that it is illegal, then usage will stay at a modest level, hopefully a declining level. If you legalize it, usage will go up. If you believe it is harmful, then you should vote no on the proposition. Thank you very much.

Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|229|R4|PAUL BUTLER|for|4|12|19|0|0|16|2|22|1|1|7|2|46|20|0|11|9|0|2|2|0|146|7|0|2|0|2|4|10|0|0|6|22|0|0|2|4|0|0|3|7|11|17|15|34|25|39|3|25|0|0|4|0|9|29|11|0|5|2|13|43|2|0|3|11|240|Thanks first to my great partner and my very worthy opponents. It sounds, though, like I was wrong about how Asa would respond to someone who he cares about who has a drug problem, because it does sound like he thinks the best thing to do is to call the police, because he said that's the only way that they'll get help. I just fundamentally disagree with that. I don't think that in order to get treated for a drug problem you should have to admit that you're a criminal. I agree with President Obama when he said, during the first campaign, that it's blind and counterproductive to lock up nonviolent drug offenders. If it worked, if it got drugs off the street, then maybe I'd support it. But we know that it just doesn't work. Clarence Thomas, before he became the first African-American on the Supreme Court, was a judge in D.C. And he said, when he would look out of the window of his chambers and see all these young black men filing into the criminal court in chains, he would think, "There but for the grace of God go I. " My friends, the determination of who goes to criminal court in chains should not be so fortuitous. It should not depend so much on the color of your skin or how much money your parents make. As long as it does, we need to legalize drugs.

And that is our motion, legalize drugs. And here to make his closing statement against the motion, Theodore Dalrymple. He is a former prison doctor and the Dietrich Weissman fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|231|R4|THEODORE DALRYMPLE|against|1|15|1|1|0|31|0|27|3|1|3|1|43|22|0|9|7|0|0|0|0|194|3|0|3|0|1|2|6|0|1|7|24|0|0|6|7|1|0|4|15|3|0|23|35|28|50|4|37|0|0|0|0|2|35|13|0|6|8|13|51|0|0|11|16|323|Well, ladies and gentlemen, first, let me just remind you that Amsterdam is by far the most violent city in Western Europe, with a murder rate between 2.5 and 3 times higher than that of Paris, for example. And the mayor of Amsterdam recently said that he wanted to reinstate the coffee houses because he had this idea that the one and a half people who go there to take cannabis every year, they would go rampaging through the streets if they couldn't get it. I don't think anyone would have said that about smokers, for example, who couldn't smoke in bars. So this suggests that there's a big difference here, a cultural difference. To give you an idea of the -- the Utopianism that is behind this motion, let me tell you that the head of the drug agency of the United Nations once said that the drugs trade was corrupting West Africa. Now, if you can believe that, you can believe anything, because when I arrived in Lagos Airport, the first time I arrived in Lagos Airport, the customs officer said, have you brought any presents? I said, I don't know anybody in Nigeria. He said, "For me. " And I soon got the general view. Crime is not caused by the illegality of drugs, nor is there illegality that causes the problems to which they give rise. If you vote for this motion, you're saying that the British were the heroes of the opium wars because they opened to the Chinese the freedom to take opium. And which they then did on a famous or notoriously large scale. And they stopped actually when Mao Tse-Tung threatened to shoot them. If you believe that the British were liberating the Chinese, then you will vote for this motion. But remember that genies do not go back into the bottles when they are commanded to do so. So please vote against the motion.

Our motion is legalize drugs. And here to make his closing statement in support of the motion, Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason TV.
Legalize drugs|i2Debates/111412 drugs.p|233|R4|NICK GILLESPIE|for|1|13|20|5|0|25|0|35|2|1|8|5|57|23|5|4|19|1|0|1|0|199|6|1|0|0|0|2|12|0|0|4|25|0|1|8|10|8|0|2|3|5|4|14|49|35|41|7|46|0|0|2|0|0|19|24|0|14|3|9|52|1|1|6|16|335|Let me suggest, contra the opposition, when you consider about legalizing drugs, that in fact it does increase your freedom to be allowed to take Lexapro, or to take Lipitor or to take LSD. It will not destroy you. I will not turn you into a fried brain, lesser son of Timothy Leary. It just might make your life a little more interesting, or it's an experience worth having. The status quo in the drug war is untenable and destructive for all of the reasons that my partner outlined. It is always going to be prosecuted. The drug war is always going to be prosecuted against blacks in America, to bring it back to Dear Old Blighty, blacks in America and the drug war are what Australians were to the English in World War I. They are human fodder, and they will be ground up and used as -- their bones will be the basis for the next bunker. There is no way around it. The drug war has always been prosecuted along racial lines, along class lines and other discriminatory practices. That's not going to change. It's not going to get better in the second hundred years of drug prohibition. More to the point, I want you to think about, as you think about legalizing drugs, recognize, is use the same as abuse?, because that's the underlying kind of premise of the anti-legalization movement, to say, you know, marijuana use might go up, so what? If it's not bad, if it's no different than taking a beer -- if it's not qualitatively different than having a beer or a martini, maybe that's not such a bad thing, especially because people who are high on pot are less antisocial and less destructive and less criminal in general than people who are hopped up on a cosmo-tini or something like that. In the end, the legalization movement is a movement for personal responsibility where we criminalize bad behavior but not arbitrary substances. So please, legalize drugs.

And now it is time to learn which side you feel has argued the best. We're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat. And I'm going to restate the motion and see where you stand now after hearing the arguments. Our motion is, "legalize drugs. " Push number one if you agree with the motion, two if you disagree, and three if you became or remain undecided. Anybody need more time? Just call out. No? All right. So we'll have the results in about 45 seconds or a minute. First of all, I just want to -- I just want to thank the level of debate we heard here tonight. I really appreciated that these two teams respected one another, appreciated one another. It was forceful but friendly. So congratulations to them for the way they did this. And to all of the people who had the guts to get up and ask questions, and even the ones that didn't get through and people I didn't call on, thank you very much for participateding and a round of applause for them. So this is our fall season. We have one more event in our fall season. And that will be coming up on -- December 5th, okay. Thank you. It's December 5th. Even in the room knew that but me. The upcoming debate is called the -- the motion is "science refutes religion. " God. Boy, you people -- Can I sit there? And all of you come up here. Thank you. Science refutes God. And the team arguing for the motion includes Lawrence Krauss -- I'm back on script. Lawrence Kraus. He is professor of physics at the school of earth and space exploration at Arizona state. His partner is Michael Shermer who is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine. And arguing against the motion that science refutes God, Ian Hutchinson, who is professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. His partner is Dinesh dSouza, the best selling author of "What's So Great About Christianity? " tickets for this debate are available for our website, that is www.IQ2US.org. Our next season begins in January. Five more debates coming up. We start on Wednesday, January 16. That will be here at Kauffman. Topics and debaters are being worked on still, but they will be posted on our website next month. If you can't be in the audience for any of those upcoming debates, there are a lot of other ways to catch them. I talked about some of them at the beginning, but you can watch the live stream on fora.tv. You can listen to the debates on NPR, WNYC here in New York. You can download them as a podcast or watch them on WNET and the World Digital Channel. Again, if you would like to tweet about the debate, we would love that. We read them all. The twitter handle is @IQ2US, and the hash tag for this debate was DrugDebate. All right, so here come the final results. All right, so remember, we've asked you to vote twice, once before the debate, and once again after the debate, where you stand on this motion before you hear the arguments and afterwards, and the team that has changed its number -- the team that has changed its results by the largest percentage will be declared our winner. So here was the motion, "Legalize drugs. " Before the debate, 45 percent agreed with the motion, 23 percent were against, and 32 percent were undecided. After the debate, let's go first to the team arguing for the motion. Their second vote was 58 percent, 45 up to 58 percent. That is a move of 13 percent. That's what needs to be beaten. The team against the motion, their first vote was 23 percent, the second vote was 30 percent. They've only gone up 7 percent. It is not enough. The team -- debate goes to the other side. Our winners, the team arguing in favor of the motion, "Legalize drugs. " Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. where we like to say, "Think twice.

We did a debate where the motion was Guns Reduce Crime. We're visiting it again, but we're phrasing it specifically a different way. Why is that?
The constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness|i2Debates/111413 guns.p|4|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|0|7|0|0|0|7|0|10|0|0|0|0|12|7|0|1|7|0|0|0|0|54|1|0|0|0|0|1|2|0|0|0|8|0|0|0|2|0|0|0|0|0|0|2|8|8|10|1|2|0|0|0|0|0|3|1|0|1|0|1|12|1|1|0|6|74|Well, let me start by just sort of saying what this debate is and isn't. It's not about whether the Second Amendment should be repealed. That's just a political impossibility. And it's not about whether the Second Amendment gives us an individual right to bear arms. The Supreme Court has decided that. So this is more of a debate about the historical context of the amendment itself and whether it has outlived its usefulness.
The constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness|i2Debates/111413 guns.p|5|R0|JOHN DONVAN|moderator|0|0|0|0|0|2|0|5|0|0|1|0|4|2|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|21|0|0|0|0|0|2|2|0|0|0|6|0|0|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|3|6|4|9|0|7|0|0|0|0|0|3|3|0|0|0|0|5|0|0|0|1|31|And the team that's arguing for the motion, in terms of putting it in historical context and reflecting changing times, in fact, I'm assuming that's what they're going to be arguing.
The constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness|i2Debates/111413 guns.p|6|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|0|8|2|0|0|8|0|12|0|0|0|0|6|3|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|51|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|10|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|12|0|2|0|9|1|10|0|11|0|0|0|0|0|0|7|0|0|0|2|13|0|1|0|4|77|Well, the world was very, very different when this amendment was passed. It was a world in which state militias were relevant. It was a world in which there were no professional police forces so that the only kind of defense against violence was self- defense, and it was a world in which it was plausible to think that an armed citizenry was a bulwark against tyranny. We had just been through the Revolutionary War, after all.

The other side is going to say no, this is not a historic anomaly at all. This amendment enshrines the ability of Americans to defend their security at home, and 47 percent of all Americans do have guns at home and see it as essential to their -- the security of themselves and of their families and those people feel very strongly that this is an amendment that embodies values, such as self-reliance, such as independence, and such as kind of collective responsibility for public order that the founders embraced and which they embrace, too, and which are relevant to this day.

They've actually been players in this debate for some time. So, Bob, thank you very much for bringing this and bringing them to the stage, and let's welcome them to the stage now.

This is Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan, and sometimes a regular ordinary guy gets to have his name go down in history in a very big way, and it happened to a guy named Dick Heller, who happened to be working in security in a government building in Washington, D.C., when he sued the government of Washington, D.C., over a law that prevented him from legally owning a handgun. And it went all the way to the Supreme Court and Dick Heller won. It was District of Columbia versus Heller and it was the landmark gun rights case of all time where the Supreme Court ruled only in 2008 that the constitution guaranteed to every American a personal right to bear arms. And if it is that obvious, then perhaps people who aren't happy with how that has turned out might want to argue that perhaps that right never should have been put into the constitution in the first place. And what a debate that would be, as we are about to find out. Yes or no to this statement: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. A debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan. We are at the Kaufmann Music Center in New York. We have four superbly qualified debaters -- two against two. Americans all, but they're divided on this motion: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. As always, our debate goes in three rounds. And then our live audience in New York City votes to choose the winner. And only one side wins. Our motion, again, is The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. Let's meet the team arguing for the motion, trying to convince you that The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. Let's welcome, first, ladies and gentlemen, Alan Dershowitz. And Alan, you're a professor at Harvard Law School. You've played parts in these cases. The Pentagon Papers, Bush v. Gore, the WikiLeaks investigations, the defense of OJ Simpson. We have heard about those cases. But on the back cover of your recent memoir -- you just came out with a memoir called "Taking the Stand," you quote Noam Chomsky, who says, "Dershowitz is not very bright and strongly opposed to civil liberties. " And you quote him. So you've given the whole thing away to the other side here?

In 1989, Sandy, you wrote an article in the Yale Law Journal that is really credited with reshaping the entire debate over gun rights in this country, which was not much of a debate up to that point. So this whole thing is your fault?

I want to begin by repeating a point that Bob Rosenkranz made. This is not a debate about policy. As it happens, I can't completely speak for my colleague, Professor Dershowitz, but I would very much oppose, for example, a federal law banning guns independent of the Second Amendment, because it is very, very clear that there is a critical mass of Americans who would be vehemently opposed to that. It would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like, there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced. Most enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity. It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed that I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds, but fortunately we're not here to debate that. Nor do I think we are here to debate the one true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about which indeed I have written. Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us, The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness. Now, one reason I relish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I will admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because I believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness. I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the one that has most outlived its usefulness, but I'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013 the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived their usefulness. So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantive rights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like? Would it include a substantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms? And I would argue that the answer is no. Let me also emphasize that this is a different question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms. Eugene has written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current number is, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the United States constitution as well. Let me give you two principle reasons why a constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners. So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness in the 21st century. The first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal. That is to say, one of the anomalies -- sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a scorecard -- in the debate about gun rights. There are many people who define themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that believes in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems. Well, this is not necessarily what Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in the McDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line. Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation. Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. There are some states -- or cities -- very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer different experiments. Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great cities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far, far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say. And one of the things that a single national constitutional amendment -- as interpreted by the Supreme Court -- does is to stifle that kind of federalism. And I think that's a mistake. But there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the 21st century. As Mr. Rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms -- or the Second Amendment -- had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008. It's not that people didn't write about it. I wrote about it. Eugene wrote about it. A number of people found it very interesting. But it played remarkably little role in actual American law. Beginning with Heller, it does play a role. But what does that mean? It means that you turn over decision-making power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable -- even unreasoned -- distinctions. Thus, for example, in Heller, Justice Scalia says that Dick Heller is protected, which I think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that Martha Stewart is not, because she actually lied to an FBI agent and is thus a convicted felon. I don't think judges should be making those kinds of decisions. I think legislators should.

Thank you very much for having me here. And it's such a great pleasure to be on the same panel with David, and Alan, and Sandy. They're all top scholars and I also reckon all of them as friends of mine. And so let me start with something I think we all agree on, on the panel. And I think probably virtually everybody -- perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, and that is that there's a basic human right to self-defense. And there are, of course, debates about the particular boundaries of that right. But there's a core to that right that every state in the union recognizes. I'm sure it's well-recognized outside the U.S. as well. If somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape, kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself if that is necessary. That is very broadly agreed on. And I think it's agreed on because it is a basic human right. So I think there's little difference about that. But then there's the question -- what does that right entail? And I want to argue that a right to self-defense, like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that are necessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself. Let's take an example. The right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether you want to have children or not. Imagine somebody says oh sure, I'm all for that right, you can use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method. We wouldn't say that's a serious argument. We'd say it's a parody of an argument, right? We'd say well of course, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools that are reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that. That's not just for that right, it's also for speech. Your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it's the right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonably necessary to effectively defend yourself. And guns are reasonably are necessary to effectively defend yourself. Our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defend ourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, and even if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficiently ruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with a gun, often not by shooting it. The overwhelming majority of all defensive gun users involve just threatening to use it. Just a couple of thought experiments. I'm sure some of you live in places -- in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol. I suspect few of you live in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol. I would be willing to bet that. So in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armed guards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled to essentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves. The right to bear arms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone. If they are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allows people to do. And I think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutions specifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's an individual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism. This dates back from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012, and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well. Now, some people may say well okay, fine. It's reasonable to say there's a presumption in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be rebuttable. If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there may be, well, then we should do that. Well, interesting argument, but there is no such evidence. So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee of scholars, of criminologists. They put out this very nice report. You can read it for free online. The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer. Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result. The other studies as well from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun control work. His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what we know. Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions, but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges? Well, one reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level, questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process. We have set them up as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this question as to whether this makes sense. Well, I think the answer to that you have to think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country given the political realities. And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want? If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want? Now, if what you want -- so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size of large capacity magazines. You have to decide what is it that you want. Now, if you want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the Second Amendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness. There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade. There are 300 million guns in the country. They're not just going away. Criminals will have access to them, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will become criminals because they will insist on retaining them. Aha, people say well, but that's not what we want, right? We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear. Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun controls the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way. Courts have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges. There's a wide range of modest gun controls. To be sure, there's federal level in many states, though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal constraint. The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control -- some people think it should be. But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't likely to be. But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendment is your friend. And any attempt to repeal it -- that is what your enemy would be. Because all of those people who have been assured, "Oh, I'm not going to take away your guns. Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you're just paranoid" -- if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I think is the implication of the conclusion that it's outlived its usefulness would be, that would turn that all -- make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that's what's going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns. So if you want modest gun controls -- I'm not saying you should -- but if you do, you should be arguing that the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness. Part of its usefulness -- besides self-defense -- is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president --

What a great and powerful argument. No wonder he is considered a genius. But let's think about his argument for a minute. The argument was really not so much in favor of the Second Amendment. It was in favor of the right of self-defense. You are right. We all agree. There should be a right of self-defense. So don't you agree with me that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as "Everybody has the right of self-defense" -- then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions. You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting, because hunting is not part of self-defense. The Second Amendment reads rather differently. It starts out by saying "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state," then the right of the people to bear and keep arms. So, I think everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, "well-regulated militia," has outlived its usefulness. We do not have militias, state militias. They are as anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops. Now, that doesn't mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights. I don't want to amend the Third Amendment. I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention. And he'll have people who might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. So I'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness. My point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the Constitution, the right of self-defense. Then we would have nothing to debate. We would all agree there is a right to self-defense. We would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places. But we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right. The primary right should be the right of self-defense. Of course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's home or oneself? Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense? Would you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term "a well- regulated militia," and say, instead, "The right of self-defense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed. " It seems to me, from Professor Volokh's argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he would have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being essential. So I think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating -- -- a new basic fundamental right -- -- and then deriving the right that's in the Constitution from that fundamental right. And so, the question remains, what difference would it make? The difference is fundamental. I agree with you. Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions. Virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense. Four countries in the world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms. It seems to me that that's a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate. And we should not federalize this constitutional right. We should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms. What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common? What does Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common? They all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates. I don't want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways. You can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way. Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home. It cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates. That just can't be a coincidence. Yes there are cultural differences. To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions, but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in? Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns? Im reminded of the great episode from "All in the Family" where Archie Bunker gets to do an op-ed on television. And he says, "The way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking is very simple. Require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun. That way nobody will hijack an airplane. " Do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a gun? And do you want to live in an America where everyone has a gun? If the answer to that question is no, let's acknowledge that the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic, has outlived its usefulness. Let's not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let's construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self- defense, perhaps -- here I'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns. That's my position. Thank you.

Thank you. When I'm not in New York City, I spend just about all my waking hours in one particular case in a civil rights lawsuit in federal district court in Colorado where I represent 55 of Colorado's elected sheriffs who are suing against the unconstitutional extreme and highly immodest laws pushed down on Colorado by Mr. Bloomberg's successful lobbying last spring. In the United States Supreme Court I presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement organizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago. Included in that coalition are the two organizations -- national organizations of police trainers, the police who train the police. My clients, like the vast majority of law enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done, strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in the right hands substantially enhance public safety. What's some of the evidence for this belief? Well, in the United States, when a burglary takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home. It's called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary. In contrast, in England, the rate of home invasion burglaries is 59 percent. In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent. And this is because, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in their home and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in those other nations. Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars -- most burglars in the United States work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do come in when somebody is home. And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that he will go to prison. And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary -- and I certainly do -- then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value. The Centers for Disease Control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization. They conducted a national survey in 1994. They found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive gun uses against burglars. Usually, without -- in the United States. Usually without a shot even being fired. And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early. Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home. If you simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45 percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million assaults every year in this country. That, by itself, would raise the national crime rate by nine percent. Guns are not only useful against burglars and for deterring burglars, but for self-defense in general. This summer the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine -- two federal research centers -- at the request of President Obama, put together an expert panel of the leading social scientists on firearms policy issues to provide recommendations for what future topics need to be researched, and also, on what topics has consensus been achieved among social scientists. What they said in their report was that the social science is clear, that when a victim is attacked, using a firearm defensively leads to a lower rate of victim injury, to a lower rate of crime completion than any other protective strategy. It is the safest thing to do for the crime victim on a broadly -- broad-scaled statistical basis. And they also said the social science is clear, that guns are used at least for good, lawful, defensive purposes -- at least as often as they are used for criminal purposes. Of course the benefit to law enforcement of this is enormous, in the fewer victimizations; the fewer crimes, the fewer people they have to respond to and help so they can help other people. Now, why is the Second Amendment necessary today? To protect people from local, bigoted governments. It was necessary in the civil rights era, when civil rights workers frequently had to arm themselves in the South for protection against the domestic terrorist organization known at the Ku Klux Klan, when local police were often complicit with the Klan. It's why the Deacons for Defense and Justice were formed in Bogaloosa , Louisiana in 1965, to successfully provide armed protection to organizations such as the Congress of Racial Equality. It was necessary in Washington, D.C., where Dick Heller spent every day as an armed guard at the Federal Judicial Center and was not allowed by the D.C. City Council to use any firearm in his home, ever, for lawful self-defense against a violent home invader. It was necessary in Chicago, where Otis McDonald, a 70-year-old Korean War veteran received personal death threats from gangsters because of his anti-gang work. And Chicago said, "Well, you can have a rifle or a shotgun. " He knew how to use a rifle. He had been in the Korean War, but for his condition in the apartment he lived in with his physical strength and agility and the current status it was, the handgun was the right choice for him for self-defense, and the bigoted city council of Chicago would not allow him to use that, and that's why the Second Amendment was necessary, and it's necessary in New York City right now. If you have a handgun permit in New York City, you can go on a trip. You can drive from Brooklyn all the way to Seattle and lawfully carry that gun in your car in every state across the country and it's a good secure thing to have in case your car breaks down in the middle of the night someplace on a deserted road. But the New York City police department won't let you take the handgun out of the city. There is no rational basis for that prohibition. It is purely for the oppression of gun owners to the detriment of self-defense. It is a dangerous law and a Second Amendment lawsuit will likely be necessary to remove that. I urge you to vote against this deadly dangerous proposition to vote for public safety based on the recognition that today the Second Amendment remains vitally necessary to the security of a free state. Thank you.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived its Usefulness. Keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening. Again, we are going to have you vote right after the arguments are concluded and the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Now onto round two and round two is where the debaters address one another and take questions from me and from you in the audience. We have two teams of two. The motion is: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived its Usefulness. The team that's arguing for this motion that it's outlived its usefulness, Sandy Levinson and Alan Dershowitz. We have heard them argue that number one they're telling you that they're not here arguing to ban all guns, they're not here arguing to repeal the Second Amendment, but they are arguing that the right to bear arms has no place in the constitution, that this should be left up to local governments and to states, that judges shouldn't be involved in making these policy decisions.

The team arguing against the motion, David Kopel and Eugene Volokh are trying to get you to vote against this motion that the right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. They say the right to self-defense is a basic human right and so is access to the tools needed to carry out and execute that right. They say clearly that they believe that guns do deliver that self-defense and went through several examples of that, but they also say that it needs to be in the constitution, because there's a bigotry at the local level against gun ownership and it needs the protection of a constitutional amendment much in the same way as civil rights have in the past. So that's where the two sides stand on this basically. And I want to go to the side that's arguing against the motion, trying to convince this audience that the constitutional right to bear arms remains vital, has usefulness, and to bring to you something that your opponent, Alan Dershowitz, said, in which he said sure, you guys are arguing the right to self-defense. They concede that's a basic human right, but they also insist it's just not there in the language of the Second Amendment. It says right to bear arms, not the right to self-defense, and they say that's a difference. Which of you would like to take that on?

The Second Amendment is the right to keep and bear arms. As Heller and McDonald say, it's the right to keep and bear arms for all lawful purposes, self-defense, hunting, target shooting, whatever. It's not limited to self-defense. Certainly self-defense is the most important purpose of that right under Heller. That's what the Supreme Court said was the core purpose of the right, but the Supreme Court didn't say that was the only purpose of the right. The right is for all lawful purposes and modern constitutions, state constitutions say so more explicitly, but their point is the same as the Second Amendment.

I think the Second Amendment historically gives the right of the people the right to use guns against their government. As Jefferson said over and over again, we need to have armed citizens in the state to make sure that there are no monarchies trying to take over. It was a right of revolution. There was no debate, as far as I know, about self-defense. It may have been implicit, but the Second Amendment's language and many of the people who are the strongest supporters of the Second Amendment are literalists. They go to the original understanding. They look at the words -- why are you prepared to excise the first, whatever it is -- 10 words from the Constitution? "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state" -- are you prepared to concede that a well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state?

So the -- I think, on this point, the court was quite right that if you look at the way the word "militia" was understood around the time of the framing -- and actually remains a legal definition of the term, although not a common lay definition -- militia meant the armed, adult -- at the time -- male citizenry, the times being what they were. And "well-regulated" meant basically well-functioning, well-trained. So, really, what they were saying is an armed, well-functioning citizenry -- well-functioning as a body that knows how to use its weapons -- is necessary to the security of a free state. And that because of that, because -- and this is a preamble that explains the rationale or part of the rationale for the right -- because of that, the government shouldn't be able to disarm the people.

We might have more public safety if there were something to encourage more regulated, well-trained citizen defense patrols, for example, in communities. But that's up to the government --

I want to return to this issue of the -- of the absence of an explicit right to self-defense in the Constitution. You want to -- you would love to draw up the Constitution all over again. You'd like to start all over. And if you did, would you write in whether it's an amendment or in the body of the Constitution -- would you write in a basic right to self-defense?

It makes a lot of sense. But quite obviously, as I suggested in my opening remarks, it's a very, very capacious right. Does it extend to Martha Stewart, a convicted felon? And to me, it seems the answer should be yes. If Martha Stewart had knocked over a bank with a gun, I'm not sure that I would say she preserves her constitutional right to self-defense. What about non-U.S. Nationals who live in the United States? You know, do they not bleed? Do they not have lives that are threatened? And then what about illegal aliens? The Fifth Circuit, as I'm sure Eugene and David both know, split 2-1 on whether or not a federal law that prohibits illegal aliens from possessing guns is constitutional. Their argument was that the point of the original Second Amendment -- and I think they're correct. I didn't do adequate justice to Bob Rosenkranz's initial introduction -- I think the historical origins of the Second Amendment really do have to do with citizen militias and organizing to overthrow corrupt governments. And the argument was that an illegal alien isn't part of the American community politically, which is certainly true. That doesn't mean that an illegal alien has no right to self-defense.

What you're suggesting is that the Second Amendment -- you're suggesting the Second Amendment is obsolete in part because it used -- the framers used the term keep and bear arms there in a way that's different from the way that it was being commonly used in the coordinate state constitutions of the time. I think you're creating obsolescence of your own making. You're interpreting it in a strange way as saying well, it wasn't intended to deal with the self-defense, and now you're saying it's obsolete. Well, I'm saying it was intended throughout to deal with self-defense. It was also aimed at a means of deterring government tyranny, but the interest of self-defense has been always around, and if you look at court decisions of the early 1800s, all the time --

I'm not denying that the right to bear arms might have some current relevance as part of a right of self-defense. What I am arguing is that prelude to the operative words of the amendment clearly have become obsolete, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security. Now, the answer that David gives is you want the Deacons of Justice to be able to come and have an armed conflict with the Ku Klux Klan. Now I was in the south during the Civil Rights Movement. The last thing Martin Luther King wanted was to arm the people and the civil rights workers. He wanted to confront violence with peace, and a well-regulated militia would've included the Ku Klux Klan. They were the citizens. They were the ones who were worried about the government taking away their civil right to have a segregated community. And the answer that my opponents give is if the Ku Klux Klan is armed, then we ought to arm civil rights workers, and let's have a war. I think Martin Luther King gets the better of that argument.

I'm simply talking about nomenclature that it's one thing to say we in America are committed to certain rights, some of which look very, very odd to the rest of the world. We could talk about hate speech in this context, and you and I both agree that hate speech is protected by the 1st Amendment. Most countries around the world don't protect hate speech, and they're decent liberal countries who simply have a different understanding of what free speech means. All I'm saying is that an argument based on the particularities of American culture is very different from an argument based on human rights.

That, in fact, the Heller decision specified all sorts of situations, guns in the hands of mentally ill people, felons, et cetera, that as it is your hands aren't tied, in fact, to effect gun ownership laws in the United States, and I just want to have you respond to that and then hear what your opponent says in response.

So, the question is who ought to decide at the end of the day what counts as reasonable regulation? I believe precisely because there's so much difference -- good faith difference of opinion, that this is an America of the 21st Century, a subject for legislative resolution. You won't like some of the particular solutions, but that's what federalism and political diversity is about. But none of us on this panel is arguing that the state can never ever limit guns, and at least as a political preference, neither Alan nor I would support in the United States in the 21st Century a proposal to ban any and all firearms, but we're talking about reasonable regulation and who ought to make reasonable regulation.

It's only been in the last six, seven years that it's played any role. So, the debate, in part, as well, should the Second Amendment now really be invigorated so that five to four majorities of the Supreme Court will decide whether or not Martha Stewart should be able to have a gun for self-defense? And it appears, although Justice Scalia didn't offer even an iota of a reason -- that he said, "No, she doesn't get it. " Or do you want these -- let's say, hashed out?

My colleague, Adam Winkler at the UCLA Law School -- I don't think anybody would think as a hardcore NRA-supporting, Second Amendment maximalist -- I think made a very good argument that the thing that probably most defeated background checks was the proposed ban on the so-called assault weapons, which are semi-automatic weapons that are really functionally not much different than other kinds of weapons. But they were singled out for specific prohibition. He said that poisoned the well, that after assuring people, "Oh, we're not going to come to take your guns," people said, "Whoa, they are coming to take our guns. " And that caused people to dig on. You're talking about the functions of individual rights. One of the functions of individual rights is to provide enough of a detente in these kinds of social battles, especially culture war battles, that a side could say, "Look, we're confident enough they're not coming to take our guns, that if what is on the table is a background check, it might pass just as it has passed in the past " -- in the early 90s. So, so, that's actually one advantage that the Second Amendment -- so securing an individual right. But more specifically, the call into question -- the quote is about the right to bear arms, specifically the right to bear arms being recognized as an individual right provides. If that were called into question, if that were repealed or people would say, "Well, we would repeal it if it weren't for our better political sensibilities," that's the sort of thing that would poison the well further. So if you want to actually get a background check passed, you're much better off with a Second Amendment respected and firmly recognized as part our Constitution, and then question and said to be something that's ripe for repeal.

This question is for those arguing against the motion. When you talked about self-defense being a great spectrum from against personal security and also against the tyranny of the government, and also talking about how the Second Amendment, in some circumstances, is anachronistic, can you let me know what it looks like today, in the 21st century, for someone to defend themselves with arms against the tyranny of the government?

In Chicago, like a lot of places, there are some neighborhoods that have a very strong police presence and a strong deterrent effect, and there are other neighborhoods that, for whatever reasons, get essentially very little protection. And when the government steps aside so that the rapists and thugs can do to you as they will, that is a form of at least of misgovernment, so people being able to protect themselves matters there. And you can look at the United States, fortunately, we don't need to protect ourselves against government in the sense that we were doing in 1776, but you can look around the world at the various tyrannies that exist and people sometimes using guns successfully protect themselves. Now I would point out, every genocidal government of the last century has assiduously disarmed the intended victims of genocide beforehand, and you can say well, if you have handgun what good is that going to do you against a tank? Well, they take the view, and they're the ones who are carrying out the genocide, they take the view that if there is any resistance, if even one of our -- out of 100 of our secret police were putting people on cattle cars gets shot, that could really mess up our genocide program.

No, no. I'm not saying that to be disrespectful, because the part of her question you answered, which was -- her question was related to where in the modern world in the United States would there be a militia resisting its government, and you described a situation in which the government was absent and so it fulfilled the function the government wasn't doing. But she asked a different question. Is there a scenario you see in this country, I think, in this country where you would need to take up arms against that absent police force or any other force that represents the established government?

Im not sure to what extent today private gun ownership in a country like America would be effective in stopping government tyranny. There are plausible arguments that by making tyranny more costly it may make it less likely even if ultimately they get super-tyrannical they could crush all opposition. Plausible arguments to the contrary. But the question, recall, is whether the right to keep and bear arms has become obsolete. What I'm saying is, there used to be two main functions, one deterrence of government tyranny and one assurance of self- defense. It's possible that today the first function is not really achievable, but the second function is very much out there. I don't see the right as having become obsolete if one aspect of it, given changes in the structure of the military and the security apparatus and changes in modern weaponry, if that function is no longer usable, I'm not sure, but it may very well not be.

And all of the focus on self-defense and the idea that the Second Amendment -- the original Second Amendment is historically anachronistic, with regard to "Oh, everybody believes the current United States is just wonderful," there are some people -- I don't agree with them, in terms of their own politics, but there are some people who don't think it's wonderful and who want to drill and know how to use arms against the possibility of engaging in armed revolt.

But partly because we think it was a just insurrection; that we think the Civil War is illegitimate because it was an unjust insurrection. But to return to your question, it's an excellent question. But if you'll look at the framing era documents and the post-framing documents -- and for that matter, the pre-framing documents, Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England -- it was understood that while, obviously, every government must be able to suppress revolutions against it -- and it will, whether it's a tyrannical government or not -- one merit that was seen at the time -- again, I'm skeptical about it today -- but without question, historically seen at the time in an armed citizenry is it would preferably deter tyranny, and if necessary, overthrow it, recognizing that if it fails, that they'll be hung -- hanged for treason. That was understood.

So my question is for the people who are arguing against the motion. And my question is if -- I think -- something that I'm a little unsure of in your argument that I think is a bit of a contradiction. You've argued that you're not going to be able to successfully impede the right -- the ability of criminals to gain weapons. You used Martin Luther King at being politically assassinated as an example of that. Yet, you also sort of stated that --

So, one of the anti-gun control arguments is what you're referring to -- the futility thesis. That nothing you do is ever going to stop criminals from having guns, and that is true for many criminals who are determined to get guns. Can you at the margins of, you know, 1 percent or 5 percent, delay when they get the gun, or can you also have laws that say well, we can't really shut down the black market, but we can say that if you're a convicted felon for a genuinely violent crime and you're found carrying a gun, that there's going to be a severe sentence and that -- the studies do show that has some deterrent effect on them carrying guns. So I think you can't --

It says, "The people have the right to keep and bear arms for security defense, hunting, recreation, or any other lawful purpose. " So that's what Senator Feingold was willing to say. I actually don't think that the preamble today -- the militia clause today -- is terribly helpful. If I had to re-write it, I'd probably end up -- I wouldn't worry about the possible political blowback that might cause even more infringement on this issue. I probably would --

I like state constitutions and their ability to experiment. One of the things I like about state constitutions is that with almost no exception, they're all easier to amend than the U.S. Constitution. So, if the good people of Wisconsin should decide in the next 10 years that maybe this is too broad, then it's really very easy to amend the constitution. One of the problems with the United States Constitution is that it's next to impossible to amend, so that we are stuck with the language of 1787 or 1791, which you're happy to jettison. But which does involve, in fact, re-writing the history of the Second Amendment and re-writing what many people thought was the original meaning of the Second Amendment.

I presume that all of us agree there are some mentally ill people who shouldn't be allowed close to a gun. I would imagine that as a policy matter, not as a constitutional matter, all of us might well agree that there are some mentally ill people whom we would, in fact, allow to have a gun if we really do take self-defense very seriously. This -- what you might want is legislators, city councils, et cetera, to write very careful legislation and tell us which is which, rather than to leave this up to judges who, quite frankly, have no training whatsoever in discerning differences of level of mental illness, or have no training in trying to figure out what, if anything, the data actually support.

Now, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the main federal law, is a lifetime ban on gun possession by anybody who has ever been found to be in the words of the Congressional statute, our laws, mentally defective. I think that that has reflected the somewhat prejudices of the time, and as Sandy has said, that there is -- there are some people -- mentally ill people on the whole are less violent than the general public. There is also a small subset of them who are dangerously violent and absolutely should be prohibited from possessing guns, but I would also -- I agree with you that the breadth of the current prohibition, I don't think, fully makes sense based on current understandings and social science.

I want to end this on a cheerful note. I want to tell you about some good news. So, from 1993 on, the size -- the amount of guns in America increased from 200 million to probably about 300 million. Now, you might think that's good news or not, but that's not what I'm claiming is good news. Likewise, or since from the mid -- in the mid-'80s about 10 states, any law abiding adult could carry a gun concealed on his person just by getting a license, except for one of the 10, you didnt even need a license. That state, it turns out, was Vermont. Now that number is over 40. During that time, and I'm not going to say -- I'm not making a causal claim here, I will tell you the claim I'm making in a moment. During that time, the homicide rate and the firearms homicide rate, basically fell by a factor of two. The general violent crime rate and the gun violent crime rate basically fell by a factor of roughly three to four. I will tell you, the number -- it was so shocking, I thought it was just nonsense spread on the Internet. But if it is, it's spread on the Internet by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, so that gives it some special claim as nonsense goes. So -- -- I think it's probably not nonsense. The serious violent crime with guns against youths, age 12 to 17, fell by a factor of 20 -- by 95 percent. Now, I'm not saying that the growing gun stock caused-- that's -- there's actually a hot debate about that -- I don't know what the right answer is. But it seems to have happened in spite of the growing gun stock. We'd think, if some of the arguments we've heard are correct, the result would have been vast amount of bloodshed. It hasn't been. Something worked. We don't know what. Nobody really quite knows what. But something has caused this tremendous and sustained decline of crime. We should be looking to see what that was. It wasn't gun control, maybe it wasn't gun de-control. It was something. That's --

It's no surprise that my friend Eugene Volokh makes very, very powerful, eloquent arguments about the public policy of gun control. But that's not what we're debating this evening. The question is to what extent any particular policy should be constitutionalized, which at the national level, means that it's close to written in stone and impervious to any change in the future. And I really do think when you vote, that ought to be the principal question you're asking, not whether you believe a particular policy in 2013 makes sense, because if you constitutionalize it, you also have to say, "It's going to make sense in 2023, 2033, and ad infinitum. " Secondly, I think David Kopel used interestingly different language at different points in his argument. And he, too, has made very capable arguments. I don't know him so well as I know Eugene, so you shouldn't take anything amiss when I don't refer to him as my friend. I've known Eugene, you know -- -- since he was a child, almost. But --

Well, that settled, actually, the question that we have for tonight in our political process. As of 1850, the Bill of Rights, as interpreted by federal courts, was only a limit on the federal government and did not apply to the states. And then we had the Civil War, and the terrible violations of the rights of the freedman that happened after the Civil War, when the southern states abolished slavery in name, but tried to keep the freedmen in de facto servitude and subjugation by saying they could only have public assemblies when they got special permission, and by saying they needed special permission, if ever, that they could possess firearms for protection. And again, that was part of the Ku Klux Klan's strategy of disarming them. The country recognized that not only were the oppressions of the freedmen under these black codes -- the new slave codes -- human rights violations in themselves, but that the lack of civil liberty in the south had been one of the important causes of the war, because it led to the suppression of speech, criticizing slavery, and poisoned the political dialogue there. And so, the country said we love diversity, we love the vastness of our country and the different state experimentations, but some experiments are so dangerous that they lead to catastrophe and we tried the experiment of saying well just leave it up to state governments to protect civil liberties. Thats not enough. We need to set a national baseline on human rights and the 14th Amendment was enacted to make the Bill of Rights, including especially the First and Second Amendments, applicable to the states. The baseline of the Second Amendment does not outlaw all gun control, and it allows Montana to go much further in protecting gun rights than New York City does, but it says everywhere that there are American citizens every government must respect the baseline of the fundamental civil rights contained in our Bill of Rights.

The constitutional right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness|i2Debates/111413 guns.p|324|R4|ALAN DERSHOWITZ|for|3|10|8|0|0|29|1|30|0|0|5|2|43|13|0|9|7|0|0|1|0|176|4|0|1|0|0|2|15|0|0|3|27|0|0|1|8|0|0|4|8|1|6|13|35|31|43|3|26|0|0|0|0|9|23|15|0|3|1|10|45|5|0|2|15|311|I ask you to vote for the motion based largely on what Professor Volokh has brilliantly argued. He has conceded that he wouldnt include a militia in his model Bill of Rights. He also has conceded that he wouldnt constitutionalize the right of hunting. By making those two arguments, he has conceded the basic proposition: that the Second Amendment the way its currently written is anachronistic and has outlived its usefulness. He would substitute another amendment for that, an amendment much like the one that he said was passed in Wisconsin. It seems to me that they have conceded away the basic argument, namely that the Second Amendment as written is anachronistic. Whats left? Whats left is: do we really want militia groups that are armed today, and armed under the Second Amendment, to have the right to confront our government and try to conduct yet another revolution of the kind that we had back in the American Revolution and the Civil War? It seems to me the answer to that is quite clearly no. Sigmund Freud had a very famous statement back 100 years ago in which he said, The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization. The First Amendment protects insults. It does not protect stones, it does not protect violence. We could live very comfortably with a First Amendment and without a Second Amendment. I dont want to amend the Bill of Rights because I worry that other things could happen, but I do want to make it very clear that the Second Amendment with its emphasis on militias and hunting, and with no mention of self-defense has outlived its usefulness. Therefore I urge you to vote yes and lets begin a debate on whether we should have an amendment protecting the right of self-defense, not the right of guns.

And well have the results in about 90 seconds from now. So while thats happening, whatd Id like to do -- first of all is say that our goal in this debate was to touch on this topic, but in a way that maybe youve never heard it argued before, and to have it argued well, and I really think that we succeeded in doing that thanks to the spirit of fairness and decency -- -- all of these debaters brought to the stage. And as you could see me struggling with shaping this questions and to -- were not used to framing it this way so everybody who got up and asked a question, even if I didnt take it, I appreciate that you got up and tried. I can obviously sense the passion that everyone in this room feels about this issue. So to everybody who asked a question and those who didnt get to, I really want to thank you as well for getting up and moving that along. Wed like to have you tweet about this debate. Use the twitter handle @IQ2US and #gunsdebate. You can join the 43,000 NRA members who have -- -- who have -- and we say welcome to Intelligence Squared U.S. We're glad to have you. We're glad you discovered us. Our next debate at the Kaufman will be on Wednesday, December 4th. The motion on that debate -- at that debate will be: Don't Eat Anything With a Face. For the motion, Dr. Neal Barnard. He's a clinical researcher who studies the effect of diet on health. His partner is Gene Baur. He is president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary. Time Magazine calls him the "conscience of the food movement. " Arguing against, Chris Masterjohn, who is a nutritional science researcher and proponent of the Paleo diet. Anybody on that? No, you don't have to raise your hand. Oh, you raised your hand. Okay. Let's all look. And Joel Salitan. He's the third generation alternative farmer who was made famous in Michael Pollan's bestseller "The Omnivore's Dilemma. " Next Wednesday, November 20th, we're going to be in Washington DC in partnership with the McCain Institute. We're going to be debating this motion there -- "Spy on Me: I'd Rather Be Safe. " Tickets for that are free. And if you get down to DC, come see us. And tickets for all of our remaining fall debates are available through our website, www.IQ2US.org. If you can't join our live audience, of course, you can watch us on the live stream, as I believe a lot of people were doing tonight. And you can listen to all of our debates, including this one, on NPR stations across the country. You can check your local listings for air dates and times, and you can hear yourself applaud. Make sure to visit our website for up-to-date information and follow us on Twitter and Facebook. Okay. And by the way, we're always open to ideas for debate topics, so you can send those in. We just -- you know, think of something -- in terms of something that's really vital and that really is a dichotomy of views, and send it in. And we're very interested in hearing those. Okay. So, we have the final results in now. Our motion is this: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. The way we do this -- you've listened to the arguments. We had you vote before the debate and again after the debate. And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. So, here are the results. Before the debate -- on the motion The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness -- 64 percent agreed with that motion. 18 percent were against. And 18 percent were undecided. Those were the first results. Remember, you have to beat the -- your starting number by more percentage points than your opponents. Here now are the results of the second vote. On the Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness, the team arguing for the motion -- their second vote was 74 percent. They went from 64 percent to 74 percent. They picked up 10 percent. That is the number to beat. Against the motion, their vote -- now, their first vote was 18 percent. Their second vote was 22 percent. That's up only four percentage points. It means the team arguing for the motion has narrowly won this debate: The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms Has Outlived its Usefulness. That motion is carried. All right. Congratulations to all of our debaters, and thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

So -- So if you can, we're delighted, but if you're not, we just want you to shut down. And just to get us started, I just want to, one more time, give a round of applause to Ambassador Volker for bringing us here. A metaphor: The U.S. government sucking in all of that data about the phone calls that we make when we're talking, who we're talking to, how long we're talking, is a fishing trawler dragging a net across the high seas. The government and its crew at the National Security Agency wants to catch bad guys, terrorists the crew on the fishing boat wants to catch, let's make it tune a fish. But the fishermen's net also drags along with it all those good guys who are swimming out there, those cute little dolphins. And the dolphins die, which is a clear harm to them. But is there a harm to us in the data that is collected by the NSA in its net. Nobody likes it, but nobody dies from it. In fact, the argument is that the NSA's big net is saving lives, keeping all of us little dolphins out there safe. Yes? No? Well, it sounds like there's a debate in that, so let's have. Yes or no to this statement: Spy on me, I would rather be safe. A debate from Intelligence Squared U.S., in partnership with the McCain Institute for International Leadership. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters, Americans all.

We look at this motion not as an extreme statement, all for spying and all against spying. But we're going to be talking about gradations, what's in the middle. As always, our debate goes in three rounds, and then the audience votes to choose the winner and only one side wins. Our motion is, "Spy on me, I'd rather be safe. Let's meet the team arguing for this motion. First of all, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Stewart Baker. And Stewart, you were the NSA's top lawyer, and later on, you became the first assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security. And in your memoir, "Skating on Stilts," you wrote about having to build the whole thing from scratch, recruiting the right people, setting up a budget. And at the end of it, you wrote this: "I did that. Now I'm tired. " So have you caught up on your sleep?

David, you are a professor of law at north town university law center. You are one of the country's leading civil liberties advocates. You've litigated many Constitutional cases, big ones, in front of the Supreme Court. We read that when you off to law school, you did not actually plan on being a lawyer, but you were going to be a writer. So you didn't, so I'm wondering, is the nation missing one great American novel?

And at the end of the debate, the team whose numbers have been changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. So let's go to the preliminary vote. Go to the key pads at your seat. And you look at the motion and the team arguing for it, this side -- the motion is "spy on me, I'd rather be safe. If you agree with that motion, push number one.

So you'll know -- we'll know who the winner is based on whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms. So we go in three rounds. And now we go onto round one, opening statements from each of our debaters in turn. They will be six minutes each. Speaking first for this motion, "Spy on me, I'd rather be safe," Richard Falkenrath.

Thank you all for coming. These issues we're debating tonight are difficult and very complex. They engage some of the most fundamental issues in American public life: Liberty, security, technology, democracy. And there really are no simple answers to this. We'll do our best to distill it, but let me just say, anyone who's worked in these issues in a practical way knows how hard they are and that they do need to be very carefully weighed and not handled impulsively or ideologically. I'm going to make three points in this opening statement. The programs that we're going to talk about tonight really do matter for security. And for me, having been deputy commissioner of counterterrorism at the NYPD and then three different jobs in the White House before, during and after 9/11, I can really tell you this on a first hand basis. And we may get into some of the details of how this works, how these sorts of systems lead to the original lead that then leads to the unraveling of a plot and the saving of lives. It is not abstract. It is real no kidding lives at stake sort of business. I don't want to hyperventilate about it, but I've lived through enough of them to be able to recount some of the direct experiences. And if that comes up in a Q&A, we'll have to go through them in greater detail. But they really do matter. Turns out a terrorist plot is not that difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far the hardest step in the process. In the overwhelming number of incidents that we've had since 9/11, that original lead, what's called the "predication for further investigative steps," has come from electronic surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter. Second, and what I'm about to say I think is going to unite both sides of this debate. Stewart and I have worked on these issues for a while. We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute, and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that Stewart and I are arguing for anything that is illegal. And since the other side I think is very likely not to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings us together. We are for lawful forms of surveillance. And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can be deployed. And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system has evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an enormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community. It's hard to believe, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. It was unfettered. Now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with -- and an act of 1978, and then adjusted in important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years. And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not previously. Previously -- if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers of the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this. And those days are over. Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within the domain of the president. There are now checks and balances on his power to do that, and that is extraordinary progress. And the third thing I want to say is how unusual this area is in Washington. As I said, there's partisan gridlock in here. Name me another issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the Middle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program. It's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan transition. So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the Bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obama administration, two leaders who could not be more different. And they are unchanged. And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the two presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal and quite educated in Constitutional law -- he taught it, University of Chicago -- and the judiciary all backing up and saying it's fine. So what the other side has to do, and it's a tough burden I think, is say, "They've all got it wrong, we've got it right, we know better. And I think frankly that's a pretty high burden for them. Thank you very much.

Our motion is this: Spy on Me, I Would Rather Be Safe, and our next debater will be speaking against the motion. He is Michael German, senior policy counselor for the American Civil Liberty Union, Washington Legislative Office, and a former FBI special agent. Ladies and gentlemen, Michael German.

Thank you, John, and just to be clear, the question isnt whether there are threats; there have always been threats and I would be the last person in the world to tell you that there arent threats right here in our own community that can harm us. And its not whether the government should have tools to address those threats -- of course it should. Its whether the tools the government is using today are necessary, legal, or effective. I oppose the motion Spy on Me, Id Rather be Safe because Im not a terrorist or a violent criminal, and spying on me isnt going to keep anybody safe. And unless youre a terrorist or a criminal you should also vote no, whether you care about your privacy or not because spying on you is only going to waste security resources and fill important intelligence databases with irrelevant information. Spying on you and spying on me makes us less free and less safe. We know that spying on us didnt protect us from the Christmas Day underwear bomber, from the Times Square bomber, from Najibullah Zazis crew who got an explosive into New York City, but ultimately flushed it down the toilet rather than detonating it. These terrorists all traveled to foreign terrorist training camps. Then they came to the United States and attempted to bomb us. Luck is what protected us in these cases, not mass surveillance. Spying also didnt protect us from the Boston Marathon bombers or shootings at Fort Hood or at an army recruiting center in Arkansas. These terrorists were investigated by the FBI before they went on their rampages and yet they werent stopped. While the government was spying on us, violence from far right extremists killed 300 people in the United States since 2001. And this is just a tiny fraction of the 14,000 murders that happen in the United States every year. A third of those -- more than a third of those -- go unsolved. Solving 4,000 murders a year? That would keep us safer. In a 16-year FBI career, I can honestly say I never found a criminal or a terrorist by rummaging through the personal information of innocent people. Traditional law enforcement standards of reasonable suspicion and probable cause dont just exist to protect our rights. These standards actually helped me as an investigator, because they forced me to focus on the right people for the right reasons, to follow evidence rather than flawed hunches or profiles. In my undercover work against neo-Nazis and anti-government militias, there were a lot of people saying things I didnt like, but I knew I had to have a reasonable basis to assume somebody was engaging in violent activity or illegal activity. Otherwise, if I couldnt find that I could just turn my attention to somebody else, because again there are real threats, and this standard helped me focus my investigations properly so those cases successfully prevented terrorist attacks, ended in successful prosecution, and didnt violate anyones rights. Today our governments spying on all of us in a lot of different ways. It collects all of our telephone records on an ongoing daily basis. It photocopies every piece of domestic mail, it intercepts Americans international communications and financial transactions, it collects millions of images from license plates readers and surveillance cameras. The FBI even collects census information so it can map American communities by race and ethnicity. The problem with these programs -- the problem is that these programs collect so much information that the signal gets lost in the noise. So its not a surprise that the NSA can point to only one terrorism-related prosecution that might not have happened absent gobbling up all of our telephone numbers, and that was a material support for terrorism case that involved an $8,000 transmittal to Somalia. Think of the billions of dollars these programs cost and how that could have been spent on so many different things, including things that improve security. If a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts had been solved the Boston Marathon bombing might never have happened. Instead of making us safe, these mass surveillance programs cast undeserved suspicion on innocent people, simply because theyre linked somehow to a suspect -- not a terrorist, but suspect, often by two or three degrees of separation, like that old Kevin Bacon game. This process creates a flood of false positives that then have to be run to ground. These are what the FBI used to call the "Pizza Hut leads" because they often ended up at the pizza delivery guy. The difficulty resolving this false suspicion leads to bloated watch lists, the watch list, over a million names on it now, but often not the right names, like the Underwear Bombers. The flood of data coming into the intelligence community is so overwhelming the agents that it's harming our security. The National Counterterrorism Center says it receives 5,000 pieces of information and puts 350 people on the watch list every day. The official review of the FBI's investigation of Major Nadal Hassan prior to the Fort Hood shooting blamed what is called "the relentless workload on the agent," which was caused by --

The FBI assessment of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was one of 1,000 assessments the Boston JTTF did that year. A study of intelligence community analysts published earlier this year included some interesting quotes. One analyst said, "There's just so much information. How do I know which of 3,000 cables to pay attention to? It's an unrealistic expectation. "

Mike German has put the problem, I think, as directly as it could be. When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations, everybody in order to make us more safe? So that's the question. You can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does. But it's not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests. And I'll take his challenge of saying, "When has spying on everybody -- when has gathering all of the data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks? " and let's take the Zazi case, the Times Square bombing case, the Underwear Bomber. When I was at DHS, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that I think Mike German would call spying on everyone. We said we want the airlines to give us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who's flying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects. We need to know who's coming here. We use that data to compare the names and the information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about. And then when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the United States, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat. That was a routine practice. And most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on. But a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people. They used this data to decide who was worth worrying about. Now, let's take the Underwear Bomber. The people who did airport security had no information about him. And not surprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them. It turned out that when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were able to identify as somebody that they were worried about. So he would have been caught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he landed. That's, indeed, probably why al-Qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he had to get past the customs officials. The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBI got a phone number. They asked our guys, do you have that phone number? Did anybody with that phone number come into the United States? Turned out that he'd given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data. The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt. And then he got on the plane and was about to leave the country. The only reason we caught him is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're looking for. He's on the plane. That plane had already closed its doors when the customs officials went on to pull him off. He would have gotten away, but for the data which Mike German calls, "Spying on everybody. I would call it "gathering data that is already in the hands of third parties," given it to the airlines, they're going to use it to decide whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg room. You know, I'm happy to have that information also used to make sure I actually arrive at my destination. And it seems to me that the intrusion -- you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is, at the end of the day, it's information that I willingly shared with the airlines, and I'm happy that they're using it to protect me as well. That's the real question we have here, is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data that you've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists? We do that all the time. The NSA program is probably the most aggressive use of that. But at the end of the day, this is billing information you've given -- we've all given to the phone companies. It is searched by law enforcement outside of the NSA program 1.3 million times a year. What the NSA did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they established for that program, they required -- Yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable suspicion passed on by a lawyer. It'll be audited. A limited number of people will have access to it. At the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year. 500 -- there were searches to find who they were talking to. 500 numbers came out as potentially suspicious. And only then did the government go out to try to find out whose name was associated with those phone numbers. 500 people versus -- and all used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to America. Thank you.

Stewart Baker gave a great defense of the public passenger data program that we've all known about for years, and no one has had any problem with. Of course, that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue here is whether we have a problem with the secret NSA program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose author said this would never -- he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it. I think that's a very different question. The NSA is collecting information on every time every one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor, your psychiatrist, your AA mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend. That's what they're collecting. It's not passenger data about people getting on airplanes. It's literally every phone call. It's doing it in secret, as I said, pursuant to a secret interpretation of a law whose author said this is not consistent with what I understood. And Rich Falkenrath says there's unanimity about this program, I don't think so. There are 30 bills that have been introduced in Congress to try to fix the problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances but because of Edward Snowden leaking it. And this is a program that the NSA lied to Congress to keep secret from us. When the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper , was asked pointblank, "Are you collecting data on millions of Americans? " he said -- in Congress, under oath, he said, "No. Later he said that was the least untruthful answer he could give. Well, I think I can think of two more truthful answers. One would have been, "Yes," and the other would have been, "We can't confirm or deny. But instead he lied to us, lied to us, why, because if we knew that this program was underway, we wouldn't accept it. Mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it doesn't work, doesn't make us safe. I'm going to suggest that you should vote against the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and privacy. A healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs that it employs. We should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a democracy. Of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's also a role for democracy. And when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy. National security is a compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds in order to keep us safe. But we have a right to have a say in how far the government goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera. And we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and lies. We should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy. Privacy is critical. It's essential to human development. It's essential to intimate relations. It's essential to political freedom. People can't speak freely when they fear that the government may well be listening in. Now, some people say, "Well, you know, if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear. But I think most of us have nothing to hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our house, put password protections on our computers. Some of us limit who can be friends with us on Facebook. We seal the envelopes that we mail. We believe in maintaining privacy because it's central to human existence. And it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in and invading that privacy. Stewart suggests, "Well, some -- if Verizon has it, why should we be concerned if the government gets it? " Well, I think there are a number of reasons we should be concerned. First of all, Verizon doesn't collect this data on every person and hold it for five years as the NSA is doing. That's precisely why the NSA is demanding it, because Verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets rid of it. Second, Verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past. The government does have that power. And, third, Verizon doesn't have the incentive to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it. And we've seen it -- we saw it in the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on anti-war protesters, Civil War -- I mean civil rights activists, Martin Luther King, and womens rights activists. So its not an abstract concern. Its a real concern. So I think because the NSA program turns democracy on its head, demanding that our lives be transparent and insisting on secrecy for the government, you should vote against the motion.

Remember how you voted just before the opening round, because were going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Now on to round two. Round two is where the debaters address one and another directly and answer questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Washington, DC. We have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: Spy on My, Id Rather be Safe. The team thats arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon -- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards. Those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities -- respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community. The team arguing against the motion, Michael German and David Cole, theyre arguing against this motion, Spy on Me, Id Rather be Safe. Theyre saying yes, there are threats and there does need to be surveillance, but that basically a government thats able to fish in this sea of data is a government thats exceeding its position in democratic society. The violation of privacy goes too far. The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong. I want to go to the side thats arguing for this motion, thats more comfortable with the surveillance programs that are in place, and say to you that your opponents have made the argument that -- well, one of them in particular, he said this program that the NSA conducted really affronted his sense of privacy, just in a very basic way. Now you -- your side, youre not denying the fact that to some degree there is a compromise of privacy. Its just not enough to count, and I want to know why that is. Where is your line, Stewart Baker, on just how willing to be spied on you are?

The difficulty here is -- or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system. That is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesnt mean its allowed to look at it. Its set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it. To make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the -- in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about. They dont have any ability to look at people for --

Theyre arguing that in fact while the data is there, that there are built in safeguards, and those things are for real. You know, theres a process through which governments need to go in -- or that the government needs to know to go in order to dig more deeply into that pile of data, but Michael German, do you trust in the safeguards? Or what is your response to their basic argument that maybe its not so nice, but its safe?

And luckily, because Edward Snowden did get so much access to it, and because were still benefiting even this week from information thats coming forward, what has become clearer and clearer is that the FISA court was being -- that the NSA was misrepresenting the program, Ill say that in the nicest way. And continually going beyond the scope of the minimization procedures and rules to the extent that in 2011, Judge Bates said it was unconstitutional .

We think it's effective in this case. And youve left out a few facts. So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records. First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information. Getting it from the government is not a search. Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently. Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision. It's called section 215. It was in the Patriot Act. It amended the FISA court regulation. People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now. 215 was very controversial then. It's still controversial now among the same people. But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place. And every 90 days, they have to do it again.

To Richard's point about the notion that this information is not protected -- we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this information.

What the Supreme Court found was that in the '70s, before Al Gore invented the internet -- -- it found that when you make these phone calls, you don't have an expectation of privacy with respect to the data regarding who you called and how long you called for. Immediately Congress responded and said, yes, we do have an expectation of privacy. And they passed a law that forbade the government from getting it without individualized suspicion. This law, the government has now turned around and perverted, in secret, to get the very information that Congress originally said we shouldn't get, and to get not just the data with respect to one suspect, which is what was at issue in the Supreme Court case in the '70s, but to get every piece of phone data of every one of us every time we make a call.

And now, here's -- do you understand why this data matters and why Mike Hayden would say that we want this information where you have no expectation of right to privacy. We talked to the coordinator of this debate, who then put us together, right? That is how plots are unraveled. They find out about one perp. They look at the communications pattern, they identify the network, and they can diffuse the plot. So imagine this was not a debate but a bombing. This is how -- this call record data is how it gets unraveled and stopped. And it's why it matters. And it's not a video camera in the bedroom. That is -- that is not a fair comparison, and I think you know it. This data, for very good reasons, the government and the Congress and the court do not hold that you have the same expectations of the right to privacy as to you do in your bedroom.

You made the case that the flood of data is actually -- it's overload, that it can't be used. And yet we heard Stewart Baker, your opponent, get up and go through a number of cases that he worked where in fact he has -- He clearly argued that the availability of the data after crimes were committed helped track down -- put together how the plot was put together and make some pretty decent arrests.

And I've seen that done on a personal basis. But what we're talking about -- first of all, it was sold as a preventive measure. This is for preventing terrorism, to the for solving a terrorist bombing. So you know, I think that the analysts at the NCTC really say it all. So another I was going to quote. "There are so many databases, people don't even know what buttons to push. They don't know where to get information, or they may even already have it and not know it. Another said, "More information isn't necessarily better. Better information is better. So that's what we have to focus on, how -- how do we let law enforcement have the tools it needs to get the bad guys without impacting the rights of the rest of us? And I think the founders did a pretty good job of setting up a system based on reasonable suspicion and probable cause.

When the NSA was asked, point blank, by Congress, and by a friendly member of Congress, can you tell us some terrorist plots that you've stopped by virtue of the NSA data mining program? The call data program, he said, "Yes, one. And it was the one that Mike referred to earlier. It was about an $8,000 transmission. And the member of Congress who was friendly to this, to the program, said, wait a minute, you have cases of violence, right, that you stop, not just transfer of money.

I -- I have to say, there's a little confusion here. I hear Mike German saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad. And I think I hear Professor Cole saying, oh, no, those are all -- spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings. All of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to. We're opposed to this one program that relates to NSA. And I think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes. That's the position that we are arguing here. And I think we've done a good job. On the question of whether NSA and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program. In the months before 9/11, NSA was listening to communications in Yemen, and they heard calls from an al-Qaeda operative. What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States. And those calls were coming from inside the United States, because they had no way to look inside the United States to see where these calls were coming from. If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person. They would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred. When you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again? And this program responds in part to that concern. And I think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency.

It's an alternative that we used for 200+ years. And the alternative says that you respect people's privacy until you have reason to believe that they're engaged in some sort of wrongdoing or that they have some sort of foreign intelligence that you want to get. And the -- but the point is it's individualized suspicion, and once you develop that, then you can tap their phone, then you can search their homes, then you can invade their privacy. What the Fourth Amendment was designed to stop was dragnet surveillance, general search warrants that gave the government the power to just pick up everybody's information in the hope that they'd find a bad guy. Yeah, it's quite possible that they'll find a bad guy if they pick up everybody's information, but the framers said, "That's not the way we want to strike the balance between liberty and security because that gives up all of our privacy in the hope that it'll make us more secure. And I -- so I think we should stick with the way we've been doing it for 200 years and not let technology and the Internet push us towards dragnet surveillance.

So you're confusing the discussion by suggesting they're the same. These are different categories of information. And while you disagree with how the Supreme Court has ruled this, the entire system is built around this distinction.

Mike Hayden has said that it's more valuable than the content itself in terms of determining what someone's doing. That's number one. Number two, the Supreme Court has actually, in its most recent decision on whether the Fourth Amendment covers GPS monitoring of a car in public, said, "Absolutely, it does. And five justices said -- because it involved an invasion of a property right -- but five justices said, "Because collecting all that information, even though it's in public, about where you go --" they were collecting where this guy went 24/7 for a month -- and all nine justices said, "That's an invasion of privacy, that requires Fourth Amendment protection," rejecting the very position that Rich Falkenrath is putting forward, that, "Well, if it's in public, there is no expectation of privacy," or, "If you share it with a third party, there is no expectation of privacy. The reality is that everything we do today is shared with a third party. Every time you walk anywhere with your phone, you're telling the phone company where you are. Should the government be able to get that without any individualized suspicion?

That is true even of the NSA program which is the one that you have chosen as the poster child for this issue. No one is allowed to search this data without a reasonable articulable suspicion. So the question really boils down to "Are you allowed to collect it first and put it in the database? " And, look, the question I thought was an excellent one, "Why would you do that if there's an alternative? " and the problem is there's not a good alternative. The alternative would be to leave it with the companies and search it there when we have some reason to be concerned about that individual phone number, but the companies get rid of that data on their own schedule. Theyve got no obligation to keep it, and they dont. Second, there are -- we got rid of Ma Bell. There is no one phone company you can go to search. No one computer system. So you would have to try to do this kind of analysis of whos talking to whom outside the United States and in -- youd have to go jumping from system to system to system to system. Its a nightmare. If you thought the healthcare.gov was bad, building this system would be worse.

No other country thought you could do intelligence under law. We set up a program that was designed to prevent the abuses that had occurred in the 60s and 70s, and by and large it has done it. But everyone knows -- everyone here knows you cant do intelligence in the open because the people youre trying gather it on will be watching more closely than anyone else to figure out how to defeat it. At some point you have to say, Ive got to trust somebody. In this case we are trusting 14 judges, two different administrations, committees headed by different parties over almost a decade. At some point, you have to say, yes, I would love it if I could know about this, but I realize that everything I know about Al Qaeda knows about, and I have to trust somebody.

So they knew that there was probable cause to believe that they were a terrorist and criminal, and yet they knew that the Fourth Amendment existed. So they dont worry about suspicion-less collection, because they know they can get caught up in reasonable suspicion collection, probably cause, proof beyond a reasonable doubt suspicion, right?

Do you find that it is actually impractical, that agents are being completely overwhelmed by the numbers they're seeing every day and not at the higher levels, but down, the folks who are actually doing the collection and ?

There is always a risk that you will be overwhelmed by data. 90 percent of the data in the world was created in the last two years, apparently. I think that's about 40 percent my kids' Facebook postings. But in fact, the tools for analyzing that are also pretty good. And no one at NSA said, we cannot keep up with this data. Once you've put it in a proper framework, they were only doing, after all, 300 identifier searches in a year. It was not a problem doing those searches. It was not a problem collecting and putting the data into a database. There may be times when an ordinary agent says, "I've got too much data," but in this program and in the program I talked about earlier, with travel data, the computer systems allowed us to use it very effectively.

I'm going to stop you there because I would rather let them make the speeches. But your question is good, and when I -- and it feels like a big softball to this side. But -- but I think it's worth getting some more detail about the way in which -- that you -- you know, you proposed something that's not happening, the TV camera in the bedroom. But let's say that data mining is happening. And what are actually the risks to privacy, aside from the kind of creepy feeling that you described having, that it can be done? What are the actual risks in the implementation? And I'll let David Cole take that.

And the danger is you put all that information together, and they can determine everything about us. They can know more about us than our closest friends know, than our spouses know. And the only thing that -- if you give them all that data, then the only thing that's stopping them from doing that are these so-called backend safeguards which were routinely violated by the NSA and which we've -- we didn't have any opportunity to debate as to whether they were adequate or not because they were put in place entirely in secret.

It sounds a lot more like Google than the government because -- and you have to take this -- this is actually a serious point. This is not the case that the government is tracking everything you do and can put it all together. And the government doesn't care what you're doing. They're actually, though, in the last 10 years, with the explosion of social media and the explosion of terms of service agreement and informed consent that no one reads, is -- what you just described emerging in the private sector, with a legal basis being a document which no one can really read and give informed consent to; unlike the program we're talking about, which is subject to extreme safeguards, rooted in the Constitution, backed up by both chambers of Congress and by the judiciary. And so I think you've really got to shift your terms of your argument here. This isn't the '70s with the FBI running around at the behest of Richard Nixon probing into people's lives. This is a world where the government is tightly regulated and overseen in a way subject to law. And it's the private sector, if anything, which is emerging as the "they" in your scary scenario.

One, we can establish limits on private sector. But two, for the reasons I suggested earlier, there are lots more reasons to be concerned about the government having access to this information than the private sector having it. And that's reflected in our Constitution, which constitutionally limits government access to data, does not constitutionally limit private access to data. There's a reason for that. And it's a good reason.

So that was done quite consciously because everyone at NSA and in the government believed that the right answer was not to look at data without some reason to believe that the person that you're looking at is engaged in suspicious activity. The only difference between a standard law enforcement search and the searches we're talking about in the context of NSA is they gather the information first and put it in a database, but didn't search it without a reasonable suspicion. The reason that they gathered it first was because it was not practical to leave it where it was. They would not be able to do the searches in the time with the efficiency that they needed to use.

And my question is for Mr. Baker. It seems at the heart of your argument is the sense of credible threat, that the public believe that there is a credible threat. But the government can't tell us what it is. They cannot reveal -- they can only say, "We've uncovered plots. They can't tell us what they are. As a journalist, I've had the privilege of talking with numerous people who do counterterrorism and journalists who cover that. And they've looked me in the eye, and they said, "The threat is real. And I believe that.

And the real answer is you don't need to believe the government. Sure, the government has access to particular threats. But it doesn't take a security clearance to know that there are a lot of people who would like nothing better than to kill everybody in this auditorium and would be delighted to have done it. We live -- that's the world we live in, and the technology that we all enjoy has empowered them. You couldn't have pulled off 9/11 30 years earlier. What I'm really suggesting is that having empowered everyone, and increasingly empowered people on the other side of the world who hate us, to cause serious damage here, we need to let the government use the technical tools that are created by lower cost for storing data to offset the advantage that the terrorists have. That's -- it seems to me you don't have to have a security clearance to have a commonsense appreciation of what the threat is and how empowered terrorists are these days.

Thank you very much for having me tonight, and thanks to Stewart and Richard for a great debate. Let me close by talking about this problem from a different standpoint. Im hopefully they only person in this room whos actually been part of a terrorist conspiracy so I have a little bit of insight on what terrorists want. They want you to be afraid. They know they arent powerful enough to overthrow a government or popular enough to win an election. So their only tool is to use horrible violence to try to provoke a government into taking measures that damages itself. They know that when people are afraid they make bad decisions, they act irrationally, and their hope is that the government is going to overreact to the threat, right? Theyre going to go after communities of suspicion rather than focusing on individuals who are meaning harm. One of the interesting things I found working in terrorist groups: they always have a manifesto, right? They create a clandestine organization and the first thing they do is tell everybody in the world who they are. From an undercover perspective, thats bad policy, but the reason they do it is because theyre trying to provoke grievance so that -- they want to let the government know who to go after so that they start to build real grievance, and thats what starts to undermine the government, when it starts losing its legitimacy by doing things that violate its own values. Thats why I think the founding fathers were so genius when they created a system that inoculated against this kind of reaction, right? It made sure that the government was accountable to the people and limited in the power that it could use, particularly in violating the civil rights of Americans, and what they knew wasnt that that was going to be a weak form of government, but that that would be the strongest government on earth. We dont need to be afraid. We need to demand accountability and we dont need to sacrifice privacy, especially for the illusion of secrecy.

I hope the audience understands that neither Stewart nor I are in favor of an unfettered, unchecked executive authority to commit domestic spying. Thats not what were arguing here. We understand that this is an incredibly difficult area of governance and requires tough oversight, the involvement of Congress, and the involvement of the judiciary. So please understand thats where were coming from. There is another side to this, aside from the legitimate interest in personal privacy that we all have, and its security. And this is, as I said in my opening, not abstract, and Ill end with a brief anecdote. I was Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism in New York City Police Department. We were part of the FBI joint terrorism task force. In September 2008, we learned of a case. We knew nothing about it until we were told as result of electronic surveillance there was an individual in Denver developing a bomb and intending to transport it back to New York City for the purpose of attacking the New York City subway around, he thought, communication with his bomb-making trainer in Pakistan. He drove across the country, FBI surveillance team in Denver acquired him and began surveilling him in the course of his drive across the country with one to two kilograms of TATP explosive in his trunk. We began an investigation of his contact, who he was in telephonic communication with. As a result of that, dozens of people he was in communication with were identified. Quickly, his two key co-conspirators, and then subject to much higher levels of intrusion -- of intrusive investigation. This was a real plot against the city of New York, where I was at the NYPD, and it was stopped not entirely, but in large measure because of the techniques we were talking about here tonight. This is not abstract. There is another side to this, and it something which is very, very valuable.

Technology has changed the calculus of surveillance in a dramatic way. It used to be if the government wanted to find out everything about who you hung out with, what books you read, who you were talking to, what you thought, it was very difficult, very costly for it to do so, and that was a check on the governments ability to invade our privacy. That check has gone out the window because of the -- because of Al Gore and the internet. We now -- it's now possible to learn everything about us through this third party information which Richard Falkenrath says we shouldn't be concerned about at all. I think we need to be concerned about it. I think we can strike a proper balance between the technology that makes it possible for this kind of very, very broad surveillance and the need to find bad guys. But we can't do so if the programs are run in secret, if the NSA is lying to us about it, and if we haven't had an opportunity to have a democratic deliberation. And when we don't have that democratic deliberation, it seems to me it's very likely that the security people are going to go overboard on the side of security. And when they're collecting texts, they're collecting data on every text that I send to my high school daughter when I go to pick her up from school, and she hasn't come out, and I say, "Where are you? I'm here. Where are you? I'm here. Where are you? I'm here. Why does the NSA need to know that information? The only reason that they have access to that information is because they did it in secret because if they had done it in public and told us they wanted to gather that information to keep us safe, I think we would have said no. And you should say no.

You know, when I started as general counsel of the National Security Agency, Janet Reno, the attorney general, came out for a visit. And this was a high- stakes meeting. She was deeply skeptical about whether this spy agency could be trusted at all, whether it understood what the Fourth Amendment was. And we were walking through an operations center with her when the director stopped, looked at a corporal who was going over some intercepts, and he said to the corporal, "Stand up, sir. And "what do you do if you find a communication by an American? " that corporal plucked out of a mass of people doing the intercepts, said, "Sir, we segregate that. We cannot disseminate it unless there's foreign intelligence in it. We must take the -- we must anonymize the data and destroy it if there's no intelligence in it," which was the rule. And I thought to myself, you know, the first rule of lawyering is don't ask a question if you don't know what the answer's going to be. But the director was absolutely sure that you could pick anybody out of that agency and ask him what the rules were. He would tell you and would be proud of the fact that he knew them and would obey them. That is the culture of the National Security Agency. If you give them the rules, they will follow those rules. They have -- we have given them rules in this context. They are subject to lots of constraints. We cannot say, "All of this public, or we might as well not try to gather intelligence. We have to set rules, we have to count on people to enforce them, and then we have to count on the goodwill of our agencies to carry them out because that's our only hope of being able to do intelligence under law. I think we can do it.

And that concludes closing statements. And now it's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best here. We're going to ask you again to go to the keypad at your seat and press keys number one, two or three. Remember, the motion is this: Spy on me, I would rather be safe. If you agree with this team that's arguing for the motion, push number one. If you agree with their opponents, this team, push number two. And if you became or remain undecided, push number three. And you can ignore the other keys. They're not live. And if you make a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your final result, and we're going to lock this out in about 15 seconds, and then we need about two minutes to calculate the results for you. So while that's being done, one thing I want to say is I've been exchanging glances with our executive producer who sits in the front row. And the thumbs-up came up about halfway through. I think this is one of the best debates that we've ever had in terms of not only the material that the teammates -- that the opponents and teammates brought to the table, but also the spirit in which this was conducted and the respect, and the -- our favorite word -- the intelligence of it. So I just want to invite a round of applause for all of them. I also -- I also want to congratulate everyone who asked a question, and that includes the questions that I passed on. There was nothing wrong with any of them. This is the kind of thing that really makes you think, and your brain starts going, and I think in fact a couple of the questions that I turned down in themselves would make excellent topics for debate. So everybody who put their hands up and those who got up to ask questions, I want to thank you as well for doing that. As we said at the beginning, we would love to have you tweet about this debate. You can use the Twitter handle at IQ2US. That's us. The hash tag is SpyDebate. Our next debate will be in New York City on Wednesday, December 4, if you can get up there for that. And I happen to know that there are some of our New York audience members who came down for this debate. So you've got to copy that and go up to New York. The topic on December 4 will be "Don't eat anything with a face. " For the motion, Dr. Neal Barnard, he is a clinical researcher who studies the effects of diet on health. Also for the motion, Gene Baur, he is president and cofounder of Farm Sanctuary. Time Magazine called him the "conscience of the food movement. " Against the motion, Chris Masterjohn, who is a nutritional sciences researcher, and he's the aproponent of the Paleo Diet, and Joel Salatin, who is a third generation alternative farmer. A limited number of tickets are still available for that one on our website, www.IQ2US.org. The McCain Institute is holding another debate right here in the Burke Theater on Thursday, December 5. They are debating this question, "Drone wars, are we going too far? " To reserve a ticket for that, go to their website, McCainInstitute.org. And for people who couldn't join our live audience, there are a lot of ways to catch these debates, going forward, at IQ2US.org and on FORA.TV, and the McCain Institute debates can be seen on their site as well. And we would love to have you listen to all of our debates on NPR stations across the country. We'll almost definitely be broadcast here in Washington on WAMU, so tune in when that happens, and you can listen to your applause. And we're hoping to make it back to Washington again next year, so go to our website for up-to- date information on that. And before I announce the final results, I want one more time to turn the lectern over to Ambassador Kurt Volker.

All right, so I -- it's all in now. I have the results. Remember, we have you vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. And the team whose numbers have moved the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. Our motion is this, "Spy on me, I would rather be safe. " The initial vote, before hearing the arguments 26 percent of you agreed with this motion, 41 percent were against it, and 33 percent were undecided. So those are the first results. Remember, you need to move the most in percentage point terms to win this game. Here is the second vote. The team arguing for the motion, their second vote is 29 percent. They went from 26 percent to 29 percent. That's a 3 percent increase. That's the number to beat. Let's see the team against the vote. They were 41 percent to start. They were 62 percent at the end. They clearly beat that 3 percent. They are our winner. Our congratulations to them. The motion "Spy on me, I'd rather be safe," the team arguing for that has lost. The team arguing against it has won. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

Welcome. Its good to have you here. My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. So, "China does capitalism better than America. Capitalism is the polar opposite of Communism, so how can Communist China be said to do capitalism better than America? Its because China is Communist in name only. In most of the ways that matter, the Chinese economy is a model of capitalism. Firms and individuals are largely free to buy the labor technology and raw materials they need to produce the products they want in open competition with others and to sell them at whatever prices the market will bear. If you include government-controlled firms, goods produced in a market system account for a substantially larger share of Chinas output than they do in America. Capitalism requires capital to invest, and over the past 30 years, China has saved nearly half of its total output and has invested most of those savings in capital assets -- plants, machinery, infrastructure, and the like. In contrast, the American savings rates have been puny, only recently reaching 6 percent of total production. And the promise of capitalism is that by allowing individuals and firms the freedom to act, resources will be allocated efficiently and the wealth and consumption of most people in the society will grow. China has done a phenomenal job of keeping that promise. Over the past 30 years, its economy has grown approximately tenfold while Americas has barely doubled. In what respects then does America do capitalism better? Clearly, the rule of law is much more developed here. Property rights are more secure, and we encourage innovation by protecting intellectual property. As a result, the American economy is far more innovative. The Googles and Facebooks and Apples of the world are American companies. Nothing comparable has come from China. We permit individuals to move freely in search of jobs and opportunities. For hundreds of millions of rural Chinese, there is no such freedom. Corruption and abuse of power by government officials is far more prevalent in China. And crony capitalism, which is certainly an aspect of American life, is absolutely rife in China. As usual, there is a lot to be said on both sides. And in the final analysis, this debate is not just about economics but about which system, American democratic capitalism or Chinese state capitalism, will be the model that developing countries around the world admire and seek to emulate. We have an outstanding panel of experts tonight, and its my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator John Donvan.

And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosencranz for making these possible. Yes or no to this statement: "China does capitalism better than America. Well, perception can say a lot, and in a recent poll, 53 percent of Americans identified China as the worlds leading financial power. Only 33 percent said the U.S. is number one. Guess what? The U.S. is still number one. The 53 percent who say that China is first are wrong. Or are they simply early? Im John Donvan. Welcome to another debate from We have four superbly qualified debaters, two teams of two who will argue for this motion and against this motion. We go in three rounds of debate. Then the audience votes to choose the winner, and only one team wins. Our debaters, each connected in his own way to the China story: Orville Schell, who heads the Center for U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. Your partner is Peter Schiff who heads Euro Pacific Capital and who has advised Ron Paul. On the side arguing against the motion that China does capitalism better than America, Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group. And your partner Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. Orville Schell, many hats on your head. You are a journalist and now an in-house thinker at the Asia Society. You were coming and going to China already 30 years ago when doing such a thing here was seen as really beyond exotic, and then before that as an undergraduate at Harvard, you studied Far Eastern History. So, since you were a teenager, China has counted for you. What sparked this interest for you in the first place?

Your debating partner is Peter Schiff. Peter is CEO of Euro Pacific Capital. And Peter, you advised Ron Paul in 2008, and talk about being right early. You called the U.S. housing bubble long before most people even saw it coming. And youre a guy who makes predictions, and you speak the language of inevitability and you dont give yourself a lot of room to back away in case you turn out to be wrong. But on China-U.S., what if you turn out to be wrong?

I think they are abandoning some of the ideas of the past, not necessarily in favor of what America is today. Hopefully maybe more what America used to be in the past. But if Im wrong, if the political winds blow in a different direction and China doesnt live up to the potential that I think it has, Ive got investments all around the world. Its not only China.

And of course, the fact is -- and this is one thing that all four of us I think will agree on -- the most important question that we need to answer is ultimately the disposition of China over the next five, 10 years. Weve taken our eye off that ball. Its going to get back.

We have you vote now your conviction on this motion. We have you vote again at the end of the debate to tell us which side you think has actually presented the better argument. So, if you go to the keypads at your seat, our motion is "China does capitalism better than America. If you agree with the motion, if youre with this side at this point, you press number one. If you disagree with this side, you push number two.

Okay, on to round one. Round one is opening statements from each debater in turn. These statements are uninterrupted. They are seven minutes each.

China does capitalism better than America|i2Debates/china-transcript.p|30|R2|PETER SCHIFF|for|5|40|26|0|0|114|0|121|7|2|6|14|199|91|0|25|42|0|0|0|0|767|9|0|0|0|0|0|61|1|1|13|82|0|37|7|21|1|1|1|25|15|25|80|185|129|170|57|141|0|0|14|0|2|100|107|0|42|15|12|171|21|20|31|62|1311|That's all you can come up with? As was stated, China is a communist nation in name only. It's not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist. And unfortunately China kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad name. And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not, you know, "Does China do capitalism better? " but it might -- but might be, "Does America do capitalism worse than China? " because neither modern America or China does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century. But the problem is China is closer to what America used to be than America is today. And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, the government in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels, 3 percent. Today the American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP. If you look at China, it's about half as much of the GDP spent. If you look at taxes, which is a real measure of freedom, back in America in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had no corporate income tax, no state income taxes, Americans were truly free in the sense that they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor. If you look at modern America and modern China, taxes are very high. They're just a lot higher here than they are in China. Individual income taxes, the typical American pays a much higher share of his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll taxes and the employer portion that's passed on, paying much higher income taxes on a personal level than the typical Chinese worker does. If you look at corporations, our corporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, China's 25, we tax dividends at 15 percent, they're at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money that the individuals are allowed to keep. You know, the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn, and that's what's freedom, it's keeping the fruits of your labor. Also, if you look at the regulatory environment in both China and the United States, I would argue that a young entrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles in his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China. The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs in China, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is a byproduct of those rules and regulations. A lot of the things that the government does, if employers don't do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits, not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don't face that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China. So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point of view of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation. I mean, China is not as capitalistic as Hong Kong, which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than the mainland. But if you're going to compare it to the United States, the level of taxation, the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, I mean, America has -- our government has an enormous debt. Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP, and that is if you just count the funded portion of our debt. If you look at the off budget items, the unfunded portion of our debt, it's enormous. The Chinese government doesn't have anywhere near that kind of liability. In fact, if you look at China and the United States and just compare the results of their economy. China is today, the worlds largest creditor nation. America is the worlds biggest debtor nation. China has large trade surpluses. America has enormous trade deficits. So if you thought about it as a nation, China has got -- I mean if you thought about the nation as a country, or as a corporation rather, China has a lot of assets on its balance sheet and lots of income, lots of profits. America is loaded up with liabilities and were hemorrhaging red ink. We have huge losses. So if you think that America is more capitalist than China or China is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is a better economic system because after all, the Chinese are more successful if you want to measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade. So, and I dont think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the Soviet Union, which was a Communist country, the Soviet Union didnt make anything, they didnt produce anything. We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves. Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States; they have this enormous trade surplus. And more importantly, theyre accumulating massive savings. If you look at China, they have a savings rate of close to 50 percent. We have a savings rate, basically negative. In fact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security. They dont have Social Security in China. They dont have a lot of these big government programs that we have in the United States. Look at our monetary system. We have the Federal Reserve, price fixing, interest rates at practically zero. In all the macroeconomics and balances that we create, we micromanage our economy through our tax code. Weve got the U.S. government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in the United States, so its not up to the free market. Credit isnt being allocated by the market; its being allocated by government. Government is deciding who should get money and who shouldnt get money and who it should subsidize and who it should penalize. It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve. Yes, youve got something similar going on in China, only in China I think its more above board. Yes, there is government and you know that governments involved and maybe you have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the United States. Were just not as above board with it. And if you think about the partnership that government has with business in the United States, most of the laws and regulations, and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this is the same with industries all over the United States. You have all these regulatory bodies that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them. And that is a function of government, and its a combination of big business working with big government to stifle innovation and to stifle capitalism. And when you have the U.S. government taking such an enormous share of our GDP and taking such an enormous share of our output in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from Washington D.C., were not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the United States. The unfortunate thing is that China is closer. But whats more important is the direction in which the pendulum is swinging. In China, its swinging towards capitalism. Unfortunately in America, its swinging away.

Our motion is "China does capitalism better than America" and our next debater is going to speak against the motion. Ian Bremmer, whos company Eurasia Group, makes its money by helping companies figure out when investing overseas is risky or not and so being right about China is practically his business model. Ladies and gentlemen, Ian Bremmer.

And so getting China right is hard. And one thing we do all need to admit is that the level of volatility in outcomes in China over the next 10 to 20 years is vastly greater than the level of volatility in the United States or in Europe or Japan. Can China make it? Can they fundamentally transform their economic and political system? A country of 1.3 billion people. We know they need to it. The World Bank just made it very clear. The Chinese government admitted it themselves. Doesnt mean they can do it, its never been done before. Its a bet. Id bet against. But its a bet. If you have to make a bet, you bet on the United States. Lots of people do, thats why the U.S. still has the worlds reserve currency. I dont know even where to start on this frankly, having just heard that China needs to bribe the right bureaucrats--but same in the United States, were not as above board about that... Thats on its face ludicrous, right? China is a system where if you want to do well, the highest levels, 52 percent of the GDP -- 62 percent of the GDP is state-owned enterprises, absolutely there is no rule of law. Theres no transparency. You dont have as many regulations in China as the U.S. That is true. Does that mean China does capitalism better? No. It means that if youre China and you want to move a village and build a road, you can. It is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective or even most rapacious form. Thats the state doing what it wants to do for the state. Thats the problem. You want to talk about state intervention? Weve got it. Weve got it in China. Look, its unfortunate to me were even debating this. Five years ago, we wouldnt. It shames me. It shames me as an American because there are people out there that believe that the United States cant do capitalism as well as China. There are countries now that are doing capitalism better than the United States. If we were having this debate about Canada, we wouldnt have as much of a problem. We wouldnt, right. On a lot of fronts -- Im willing -- Im not saying the United States is worse on everything. Im saying that life increasingly, if you look at issues like the deficit for the U.S., if you look at financial regulations -- Im not going to stand behind all that. But I am going to go after China, because ultimately we have a problem. Look, the Chinese system is not just capitalist; its state capitalist. State capitalism is a system where the state is the principal actor in the economy. And it uses markets ultimately for their own political gain. If it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain, theyll go for it. If it turns out it isnt, theyll go against it. And thats true whether were talking about Chinese firms or whether were talking about Western firms. I mean, Facebooks doing a pretty good IPO, but theyre not in China. Why? China doesnt want Facebook in China. Itd make a lot of money. Itd make a lot of money for China. Thats not the point, right. Thats not capitalism. Thats a problem. Ultimately, when weve seen state capitalism work globally, it works until it fails. And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and I suspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, but it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff. Argentina was state capitalist, looked as good as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran out of cheap land. And then they started defaulting. Venezuela looked great on cheap oil. Not so much anymore, right. Chinas looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheap labor. China will ultimately run out of cheap labor. So, what we have in China is this extraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road. And that road has been straight for 34 years, but coming up theres a big turn in the road. And weve never seen steering. Maybe -- thank you, mom -- maybe -- Maybe they have steering, but we dont know. And the fact is that if you are China, theres one thing youre going to have a very hard time doing. There are no more Zhu Rongjis and Deng Xiaopings in China. You dont have strong individual leadership. You have leadership by consensus, individuals that are moving together very incrementally. Theyre very cautious. They understand the importance of the stakes they are playing for. The one thing that you will not do well is go after your own intrinsic interests. The state-owned enterprises that are providing you money -- thats where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets more expensive. Thats where the inefficiency will be when the United States and other Western multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off. Another problem with Chinese state capitalism is it creates enemies, you know. There are a lot of folks around Asia. They see the Chinese economic miracle, but theyre begging the United States to maintain a presence. Why? Because China does capitalism better than the United States? I dont think so. We got to watch what people do, not what people say, what they do. Did you see that piece in the Wall Street Journal, talked about the disposition of Chinese millionaires, how over 50 percent of Chinese millionaires say they prefer to live in the United States than China? And yeah, its about quality of life. Yeah, its about the environment. Yeah, its about opportunities for their kids. Its also about no rule of law in China and worrying about corruption and the sanctity of their assets over the long term. Your assets are okay tomorrow. The United States, were over-litigious. China doesnt have that problem. You dont have to worry about lawyers in China. You have to worry about someone ripping off your stuff or being forced out of the country or not being heard from again. Now, maybe Peter believes that those 50-plus percent of Chinese millionaires are stupid. Because ultimately, the United States is in decline, and so they shouldnt be coming here, in which case, fine, but then Chinas millionaires arent that bright. And those are the entrepreneurs, so we shouldnt bet on them either way. Youre in a catch-22, sir. You know, Im interested in what the Chinese do with their money. I understand that the Chinese are saying that they dont like the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, but where are they putting their cash? In the U.S. Now, Ron Paul and Peter say they shouldnt do that, and then were in big trouble. Okay, well, when are they going to stop? Because I dont believe the Chinese are stupid. For me, thats not an interesting analytical model. For me, whats interesting is presuming the Chinese understand their interests and theyre putting all that money into treasuries because they believe thats safe over the long term. We are entering an environment of fear. Were entering an environment of volatility. When things get more volatile, we dont just bet on go-go- growth any more. We put our money under the mattresses. Central banks do that too. And in that environment, the worlds largest economy, also ultimately the most resilient, the United States of America. Thank you very much.

Heres our motion: "China does capitalism better than America. We have heard the first two speakers, and now on to the third. Ive lost a page here. Well, Orville Schell, Im just going to vamp. Orville Schell is head of the Center for U.S.- China Relations at the Asian Society. You have also written something like nine books that have the word China in the title and some that dont have China in the title. You know what youre talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, Orville Schell.
China does capitalism better than America|i2Debates/china-transcript.p|34|R2|ORVILLE SCHELL|for|5|32|28|1|0|69|0|85|0|0|11|13|141|43|0|17|10|0|1|0|0|547|13|0|1|1|0|8|43|0|0|21|64|1|4|6|17|3|4|4|12|12|24|53|142|86|125|34|92|0|1|8|0|0|59|52|0|16|4|22|126|23|7|8|41|910|Well, I find myself in the awkward position, being an American, deeply believing in this country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers, to defend a Marxist-Leninist economy. And I beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my argument and please convince me I am wrong by voting against me at the end of this debate. I would say that the comparison between capitalism in the United States and China is as much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise. And there, in a very counterintuitive way, one we hardly have expected, the Chinese Communist Party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under Leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which I think all of us would agree, over the past three decades, has been quite extraordinary -- something none of us who were standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square of 1989 when there were a million people demonstrating there, thought could ever possibly happen. So, I think if we look at America, we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological self-doubt at this particular moment. We find a country that has had much of its government, many of its leaders besieged by irrationality, religiosity, they dont believe in evolution, they dont believe in climate change, we cannot pass a simple measure in Congress to extend the national debt, which is not going to not happen. How can a government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason, how can it be the custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside over? This is not to say that we dont venerate entrepreneurs, we dont venerate innovation, and we dont believe in a free economy. But let me read you just simply what Adam Smith had to say, the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism. He said that when the security of the whole society is at stake, natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments, the most free as well as the most despotical. And I think it is precisely here that we have failed. And by doing so, we have lent a greater credence to this curious, cryptic, hybrid version of Leninist capital, which China has employed, to quite a bit of success, I would have to say. So let's quickly just look at what we see in China. I spoke of the psychological dimension of the problem in this country, and I think everybody in this room feels it. There is a sense of I think lassitude. At the same time, greed is quite a force lost in the land. There's a great deal of self deception at work. If you look at China, who's running the government in China now? They're all engineers. In many ways, the very things that we used to impute to China as a great weakness, namely, a over reliance on ideology, are now the very things that are hampering our own country, while China, governed by engineers and technocrats, tends to look at reason. There are no climate deniers in China. I have never spoken to a Chinese who doubted evolution. And yet the ranks of the American political houses of Congress are replete with these people, and they're making decisions which govern how we live and govern the American economy. China also has managed in a way that I think it deserves our esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done. When a stimulus program needs to be enacted, they look at the facts and they enact it. Do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to some retrograde period of Stalinist economics? Well, I think the United States could do with a good five-year plan. We can't plan for three months ahead. We have no ability even to execute policy, much less long range policy. If you go to Washington, you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy documents. Why? Because nobody can do anything with them. I think this ability of China to martial facts rationally, to martial its resources and make policy and allocate capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own country could learn from. I want to read a quick quote from Henny Sender from the Financial Times. "The combination of Chinese SOEs and debt from state owned banks is a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of China as well as within it. " I think that's an interesting statement from a paper that's basically a laissez faire capitalist paper. So finally I would say that we would do well not to assume that China has nothing to teach the United States. It may be that this system will not endure in the future. It has many structural weaknesses. But to date I would say it has been ascending while our own form of capitalism, replete with the weaknesses that you all well know, has been in a state of decline. And whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come.

Our motion is, "China does capitalism better than America. " And our final debater speaking against the motion, speaks the Chinese language better than anyone on this stage, he has the advantage of having been born there, but he has been living here for decades, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna, the titles of his books and articles on China's future use phrases like, "China's Trapped Transition, Looming Stagnation," so we don't need to ask what he really thinks. But here's more of what he does think. Ladies and gentlemen, Minxin Pei.
China does capitalism better than America|i2Debates/china-transcript.p|36|R2|MINXIN PEI|against|9|20|8|0|0|48|0|66|0|0|10|2|78|40|0|8|19|0|0|1|0|385|3|0|1|0|2|2|11|0|1|9|27|0|6|11|10|0|0|9|6|11|7|28|87|91|59|19|74|0|0|10|0|0|37|40|0|11|8|15|105|2|6|16|64|719|I'm not going to speak in Chinese. I think that the impression that China is doing capitalism better than the U.S. is understandable. That's because it's a very superficial impression. One reason why that impression is widespread is that China has been growing fast. But there's a reason China is growing fast. Low income countries tend to grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential. Just think of two things. Consumption of energy. Chinese consumption of energy is about one-fourth of the U.S. consumption. So the Chinese, if they consume more energy, they will grow a lot faster. The same with steel production. China consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average American consumes. So if they want to reach American consumption, they need to build a lot of steel plants, and that makes economic growth. So first of all, do not judge whether a country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers. Second is that when you compare the two countries, the U.S. and China, you have to look at facts. This presentation is nothing but man the facts. So what are the facts? If you look at corporate profits, U.S. companies are far more profitable than Chinese companies. And that is to think that we can trust Chinese accounting. And then you look at tax collection. I have to disagree with Peter. He says the Chinese, they collect less taxes than U.S. The opposite is true. The U.S. government takes about federal/state, about 30 percent of GDP. The Chinese government collects 35 percent. But thats not the end of the story. Because in the U.S., you actually get something back from the government in the form of Social Security, health care, Medicare, Medicaid. In China, you get very little back because the bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption, administration. If you go to China and get treated to a 20-course meal, you think great, thats Chinese hospitality. But dont forget, its being paid for by Chinese taxpayers. Not in the USA. You do not get that kind of treatment when you go to Washington, D.C. And then you look at whether Chinas growth is using less natural resources. And here the U.S. is three times more efficient as China. Because for every dollar of GDP produced in China, China has to consume three times more in terms of its natural resources, water, clean air, land. The U.S. in other words, is a lot more efficient. Then you look at international comparisons, and here were using third-party numbers. And here, China does not look nearly as good as the U.S. Corruption. Theres a NGO based in Berlin called Transparency International. It publishes every year, a global index called Corruption Perception index. This index, the U.S. is ranked 24th in terms of, as the least corrupt country in the world. China is ranked 75. So if you think our average politician in Washington is corrupt, wait until you meet a Chinese politician. Then you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its efficiency and competitiveness. Here, the U.S. is ranked not number one, number five. What about China? China is number 26. So way, way behind the U.S. Then you look at something like innovation ranking. The U.S. is number seven; China is 29. You look at ease of doing business. This is by the World Bank. Because, a real capitalist country should be one in which it is very easy to do business. Overall ranking for the U.S. is number four in the world. China is number 91. Then starting a business, U.S. is number 13; China is number 151. Getting credit, the U.S. is number four; China is number 67. The list goes on and on and I dont want to bore you. Finally, I want to imagine, what will the politburo members think about this debate? If for some reason, theyve learned that in New York City, theyre debating whether China does capitalism better than the U.S. I think their first reaction is not to laugh. [laughter[ Then the second reaction, they say the Americans are really easy to impress. You stage an Olympics. They think China is number one. You build the worlds largest high-speed rail at enormous cost.

Then you lend the Americans $2 trillion. They think, China is definitely number one. So, the third thought that would come to their mind is that the Americans have very short memories, because when Sputnik was launched, everybody thought the Soviet Union was to dominate the world. And then in the late 1980s, I think in this city, people should have good memories about who was buying the Rockefeller Center, right. Japan was dominating the headlines. Everybody thought Japan was doing capitalism better than the U.S. Now, look at where Japan is after 20 years. So, I think what were seeing here is not that China does capitalism better than the U.S.; we are experiencing a period of self-doubt. Im sure the real issue is not about China. The real issue is about the U.S. The U.S. can do capitalism much better than it does, but China, at least for the moment and for the foreseeable future, will not be doing capitalism anywhere better, anywhere close to the U.S. in terms of competition, efficiency, even social justice. Thank you.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. When we return, the debaters go head-to-head in round two. Well be right back. And now we are right back. Were just going to have these lecterns removed, and then Im going to raise my hand for a round of applause. And imagine commercials are playing somewhere. Okay, lets start again. Thank you. Now, on to round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. This is where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me. We have here two teams of two who are arguing out this motion: "China does capitalism better than America. Weve heard the team arguing in support of the motion, Peter Schiff and Orville Schell, basically saying that China does capitalism better because theres actually more freedom to do things that involved capitalism, that there are fewer regulations, that there are lower taxes. It is not pure capitalism and theyre not arguing that, but theyre saying that its more pure than the U.S. has had in the last 100 years. Chinas amazing growth rate really seals the argument for them, but they also make the point that possibly an economy operating under the apparatus of what we call a democracy in this country has its downside. And they suggest that maybe a little planning is not such a bad thing. The team arguing against the motion, Ian Bremmer and Minxin Pei. Theyre making the argument that what Chinas doing, even if it could be called capitalism, is something thats probably cruising for a crash, that when the government is the biggest player in the market, as they argue that it is, point out that it is, this tends to lead to corruption and to cronyism and ultimately to exposure of the lack of real innovation. They basically are also making something of a hare and hedgehog argument and pointing out that China is the hare and its in a good dash right now, but that the U.S. is the hedgehog, plodding along steadily and more reliably. So, I want to take a question from this sides argument to that side, and thats that argument that what were seeing from China, this enormous growth rate, your opponents have pointed out, number one, is the result of China coming off a much lower baseline. And when things get really volatile, things can really fall apart there. And theyre essentially saying that whats happening in China over the long haul is a blip. Is it a blip? Peter Schiff.
China does capitalism better than America|i2Debates/china-transcript.p|39|R3|PETER SCHIFF|for|2|16|5|0|0|17|0|31|1|0|3|1|42|23|0|4|11|0|0|0|0|147|1|1|0|0|0|0|7|0|1|4|22|0|0|7|6|0|0|1|4|0|4|1|22|28|32|12|27|0|0|0|0|0|8|15|0|5|0|5|39|0|0|1|7|230|Well, first of all, there are a lot of countries that are starting on low baselines that are not having any kind of economic growth at all. So, the difference is you do have more capitalism now in China, and its that freedom, its that -- those market forces that are responsible for the growth, not that because theyre poor, because there were plenty of people that were poor and that didnt grow at all. As far as whether the trajectory is sustainable, I think not only is it just sustainable, but I think its going to get better because the real country thats headed for a crisis is America. And I think whats dragging the Chinese down is their currency peg. Theyre loaning America all this money, so American can keep buying the products that Americans really cant afford. And so, as a result, the Chinese are debasing their currency and theyre creating a lot of inflation, which is destabilizing their economy and, I think, undermining the standard of living of their own citizens, which would be rising even faster if the Chinese government simply let the RMB rise in value, let the dollar tank. If the Chinese government didnt take so much of the Chinese production and just loan it to America so that it could be squandered on big government and consumption, but I think eventually --

And the real crash is coming here, because then interest rates skyrocket, the dollar tanks, consumer prices go through the roof, and we have our Greek moment, only theres no Europe to bail us out.

Ill get there. Look, the United States has so many strong intrinsic advantages in terms of not just the matter of where the dollar sits but also, I mean, 30 percent of the worlds calories comes from the United States. People are increasingly fighting over food. Thats a real problem for China. The environment in China is absolutely falling apart. If you look at environment-adjusted GDP, its so much worse than the growth you see presently. We already heard from Minxin about just how much more profitable American multinationals are than Chinese SOEs, and yet that China is moving more in the direction towards SOEs, not towards private sectors, especially since 2008. All of these things are problematic, and the ability of the Chinese to suddenly make a decision to go away from the dollar, you have to go into something. What exactly are you going into? Youre going into the euro in an enormous way. I dont see that in terms of massive growth opportunities. Youre going into Japan? We already said we had two lost decades there. Youre going to go into gold or hard commodities? You can do some of that. You can only do so much. And as you go away from the dollar, you of course ruin the position that you have in the rest of those dollars. So Chinas not going to do that. They havent, and theyre not going to.

Were doing a comparison here, and were talking about recent history, not an idealized America. And wed be very foolish to idealize China. And I think what we have to reckon with is the chances of each country finding a new state of equipoise, the United States included. It is not a foregone conclusion that were going to pull this thing out of the water. I think if this country cannot grasp reason again, it doesnt matter how good or bad China will be, China may have an unfair advantage. I think whats going on in Washington right now is so utterly mad and broken that I put no confidence whatsoever in their ability to play that central role that every government, and I may disagree with you here, Peter, but every government must play.

Minxin Pei, what about that? Is a little planning a good thing after all, or a lot of planning?

Well, I would say that we get a lot more liability. If you try to figure out what each American share is of the national debt, it is enormous. And what the government is giving the American people is debt. I would much rather -- and if youre talking about capitalism, youre defending capitalism by saying we get Social Security, whats capitalistic about essentially planned retirement thats financed like Bernie Madoff ran his investment business. I think its much better that the Chinese are free to keep their income and plan for their retirement.

I mean, you look at Apple, you look at the manufacturing of the iPad, $9, $10 is captured by China, about 60 goes back to Apple and its shareholders, most of whom are American. I like that trade, right? I mean, there's a reason why American multinationals actually do better, but we have a problem in the United States with an increasingly large percentage of Americans, right, a book that I think you probably have read by Charles Murray, "Coming Apart," increasingly, they're not doing as well. They don't have as much opportunity. We have to address that because if not, long term those folks are going to get upset.

You talk about the serious psychological toll in this country of the financial crisis and the near economic collapse. And you say, worse still is the fear that Americas leaders cant fix these problems because the U.S. political system is broken beyond repair. Is it?

The Democrats and Republicans had a basic agreement about it, some of it was Iraq, some Afghanistan, some was going to be increased airline fees, some was going to be reductions in agriculture subsidies that was fairly easy to do. And then at the last minute, they decided not to do it. But in part the reason they decided not to do it is because theyre not being pressured. In Europe -- one second -- I know youre excited. In Europe they are being pressured and theyre finally acting. And it got really ugly before it had to happen. The unfortunate lesson that we are all learning since 2008, the world is getting faster. Governments are not getting faster. And thats true in the United States. Were kicking the can. Thats true in Europe; theyve done a lot of kicking the can. Japan. But the largest can getting kicked hardest down the road is the Chinese can, and thats by far the one Id be most worried about.

We didnt have any serious discussions. That trillion dollars in cuts was an illusion. It was spread out over 10 years, so its 100 billion a year in almost a $4 trillion budget and it was simply reductions in the proposed rate of increases. So we werent even talking about dealing with the problem. But you are right, we dont have to deal with it because both the Federal Reserve continues to print dollars and buy treasuries and the Chinese central bank and foreign central banks continue to print their own currencies and buy dollars and buy treasuries. So we are the ones that are literally living on borrowed time. Youve got to think, whats going to happen in America when like Europe, we are forced to deal with the enormity of the consequences. If you look at our federal debt, which is the funded portion, is financed like a sub-prime mortgage with a teaser rate. How is the U.S. government going to handle 5 or 10 percent interest rates on this national debt? How is the banking system in America going to handle it when all their assets are imploding, their long-term government bonds and mortgages that they have on their books and they cant get cheap money anymore from the Fed. What happens to our housing market?

The high growth period for China is over. I urge you to read the World Banks latest report on China called China 2030. Its free for downloading on the World Banks website. This is what it says. From now on until 2030, if China does well, its average growth will be somewhere between 6 and 7 percent. And if China does not do the set of reforms the World Bank recommended, probably China cannot even achieve a much reduced level of growth because China is coming into an era where savings will be a lot lower. The population will be a lot older. The environmental costs will be a lot more visible if you -- Im sure a lot of you have been to Beijing. In the future when youre in Beijing, you should bring along a space suit.

I mean it is a great dream machine and we have a great country and many Chinese would like to live here. But what is interesting in the last few years is the number of Chinese whove gone home. And theyve gone home because they see opportunity. They feel -- anyone whos been to China lately feels an amazing sense of energy. And I would have to say that these great American virtues of get it done, whatever it takes, can do, I feel, and Im surprised, more and more, have been incarnate in China and less and less in America.

And its part because the Chinese system is really one that is focused on China, period. One of the major problems China has is that for them to build the state capital system, they have to support China and the Chinese market. Where the system that the United States supports is really one of having as much access to global competition in markets as possible. And ultimately, thats a much more efficient system. The United States corporations benefit from it. Were the ones who are pushing the WTO. Were the ones who have been pushing the Doha around. When that doesnt work, we go for the TransPacific Partnership, the TPP. We want broader markets. The Chinese are saying no. For 4G, we want a Chinese standard. Now, I understand that theyd rather have a Chinese standard than an American standard, but the point is that the Chinese are saying we want a Chinese standard as opposed to a global standard. That -- other countries dont like that. They want more efficiency, and from that perspective, the Chinese incursion into the global free market -- my last book was called The End of the Free Market not because I thought the United States wasnt going to have a free market anymore but because I thought that the rise of China as the worlds second largest economy eroded what had been global free markets and competition and actually poses an enormous problem for third-party countries. As China gets larger, that challenge grows. And so, not only the domestic challenges, but they will have greater international challenges.

What China has done in terms of making its growth faster is to move a lot of labor from agriculture into the cities. The moment that happens, automatically, they produce a lot more because thats urban areas, their jobs actually pay them more. So thats one. But in terms of labor mobility, rural migrants in China still suffer a lot of discrimination, because if they move to cities, Im sure some of your workers have experienced -- they do not enjoy the benefits of urban residence. For example, they have to stand there; they cannot enroll their kids in public schools. They have to send them to substandard private schools. And they do not enjoy any retirement pension protection. Thats available only for state workers.

I mean, first of all, we have a minimum wage law that effectively makes it illegal to hire a pretty sizable chunk of our population that cant get a job. But even for the Americans who are employed, you have the government dictating to employers all sorts of criteria upon which they have to base their decisions on who to hire and who to promote, and therere all sorts of mandates that, as an employer, you are required. You have to do this, you have to do that, at often great expense to yourself. So, I dont think you have a lot of freedom in the U.S. labor markets. There are so many different ways you can be sued as an employer in this country that a lot of people do what they can to avoid hiring people because they dont want to get within the crosshairs of the government or the legal system that has sprung as a result of all these mandates. So, I would think that if youre an employer in China and youre hiring people, I dont think that you have to worry about that as much as an employer in America, that youre going to be sued by your employee because you, you know, you passed them over for a promotion or maybe you didnt hire somebody and they want to sue you and claim its because youre, you know, youre handicapped or youre a different race. I think you have more freedom there. And to try to -- you know, I mean, I dont even want to hold up --

But having said that, I think we have to be honest that authoritarian capitalism has been able to do things that a freer form of capitalism sometimes fails to be able to do.

Yes. But we cant compare human rights in the United States with China, obviously. The U.S. still makes -- does a lot of things wrong. Thats like this broader debate. The U.S. does a lot of things wrong on capitalism but still vastly more effective than China. The U.S. has a lot of problems in human rights, but China isnt in the same league, right, not on the same league sheets. Lets be very clear. And while I think that a certain level of human rights abuses facilitates rapacious capitalism, especially in the short term, in the long term, it will bite you in the hiney. And there are other places that you get problems, too. I did talk about transparency and the fact that places like Facebook and Google and Twitter are a problem for China because they want to own that data. They want to control it. They want to shape it. They want Chinese state Internet just like they have state capitalism. Thats a problem for them. When I think about responses in terms of general transparency, in the United States you do actually know largely what your officials are up to. Solyndra was a disaster. It was a bad thing for the United States. Peter and I will agree on that. But we found out about it. And we found -- on balance, people got egg on their faces. In China, they dont want to tell you about Solyndra. You dont have media thats getting inside the dirty laundry of serious Chinese officials. They are engineers that run the country. They are also billionaires. Lets remember that, okay. And thats the problem of the lack of human rights and transparency in China. It doesnt facilitate creative destruction. It doesnt facilitate allowing the Chinese people to take advantage of a free market. Maybe the Chinese people would be just as good capitalists as we are, but unfortunately, their system doesnt allow it to be. And thats a problem.

What you're doing is you're creating a special privilege for one particular protected class. And when you do that, you diminish freedom, and you diminish liberty in the country, but apart from that, you create all sorts of problems for the businesses because now the businesses have to spend all sorts of money to protect themselves against lawsuits. And in many cases, people that would have tried to bend over backwards to hire the disabled, now they won't touch them because they're too afraid of getting sued.

I mean, I believe in individual freedom and I believe in rights, and it certainly is part of the discussion. And the question is where do you have more individual freedom or individual liberty? Do you have more right now in China or do you have more in the United States? And my argument earlier is that the typical person in China is going to surrender less of his economic output to his government in the form of taxation, and I don't think his day-to-day life is going to be as impacted as heavily as they are in America as far as regulations. But, we have -- as far as trial, there are political prisoners in the United States, too, it's not just in China, I mean, my father's in prison for politics I believe, in this country.

It's a socialist system where the government takes over the means of production through taxation and regulation. And that's what we have. I mean, any business, I own my business but the U.S. government makes a lot more money from my business than I do. I mean, it's not even close.

I think the best measure of whether a country is capitalist is to look at the contribution to GDP from state-owned companies. And here the U.S. cannot even compare. In China state- owned companies contribute 40 percent to GDP. In the U.S., I don't know about GM -- the U.S. is getting out of GM, incidentally. Now, probably little less than 1 percent. So rest assured, we are still very capitalist.

If a corporation borrows, it does so to increase its productivity. It's acquiring income generating assets that enable it to service that debt and retire the debt, so that's productive debt. When you're talking about the federal debt, you're talking about money that has been borrowed and spent on consumption on government.

China does not and China has one of the most rapidly aging populations. And the lower reaches are not being replenished with the one-child policy, so its going to have a huge burden of taking care of elderly people and not have younger people coming in on the bottom to support them. Thats going to be a giant problem.

And furthermore, it also leads China to export not just capital when they try to extract commodities for example in sub-Saharan Africa, but also labor because they need to do something with those men. Thats a problem for African countries that want to have employment in addition to Chinese cash. And eventually it leads to a backlash. Again, Chinese state capitalism is a problem not just because of domestic inefficiencies but because of the backlash it creates globally. Thats one we havent started to experience yet because China isnt big enough yet. But as it gets bigger, its going to get squeezed.

Peter Schiff, do you take a side, or take a side for?
China does capitalism better than America|i2Debates/china-transcript.p|161|R3|PETER SCHIFF|for|2|10|1|0|0|13|0|22|0|0|4|2|31|14|0|6|4|0|0|1|0|105|4|0|0|0|0|2|9|0|0|4|16|0|3|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|7|18|17|25|2|15|0|0|0|0|0|6|12|0|4|2|3|29|0|3|3|7|171|Well, I mean, capitalism to me is where the means of production are controlled completely privately. Where the factors of production, production, land, labor and capital are allocated through a market where prices for all goods and services, wages, interest rates, are set by the market. As opposed to a centrally planned or Socialist economy where a lot of these decisions are made by bureaucrats and where the means of production is being micro-managed from a centrally planned authority. Where theyre making decisions based on politics, this should be produced; that should be produced; this should be favored, that should be favored. And whether the government does it directly, like a Communist would, by nationalizing the means of production and actually owning them, or rather it takes a different route by controlling them through the tax code, through what it taxes and what it subsidies. And how it regulates and what businesses it favors and what it punishes. When you start doing that, you dont have capitalism, you have something else.

I think thats the best description of the Chinese economic system. The part about what capitalism is not. But I would add one more thing. I think modern capitalism also has a legal system. The rule of law. Without the rule of law, there can be no capitalism. And China does not have rule of law.

I lived in China for six years and I think in order to engage in this debate, we should define the term capitalism. I think Peter did define that term. I do think youre all very erudite in your -- and very articulate in comparing the two systems. But I think in terms of capitalism, Peter did define that. But also, I dont think its fair to use World Bank figures because theyre not on the ground. Sir, I need you to get to a question. Dan O'Connor: Okay. Actually, I guess to get right to the question. Id like to hear a definition of capitalism from everyone. Okay, we just did that. I think we -- well move on then. Right here sir. Wait -- hubbub down. Thank you.

My question is as China, like other low and mid-income countries, moves up the value chain, its going to eventually have to start to turn ideas into products instead of just assembling products. How do you expect that to occur in China, given the current status of intellectual property rights and in other related terms like that where its just very hard to create ideas and own them in China?

And China is creating intellectual property, and as it does, I think its going to bring itself to heel. One hopes it will, and it simply must or it cant be a world player. But China must move up the value chain, because the labor is getting more expensive. Theyre just lower down than we are. America doesnt do much manufacturing anymore, not as much as it used to. Its had to move up the value chain into knowledge and information technology. Thats Chinas challenge too.

I see the problem as you do, in part because the educational system doesnt support it. They create a lot of engineers, but they dont create a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of innovators because theyre still teaching by rote as opposed to teaching students to actually question, you know, sort of whats behind. And theres a reason why so many folks that create things in the United States are college dropouts or, you know, sort of came from these kind of unusual background systems. They really want to know not just what four times four is but also why it works that way. That doesnt work well within authoritarian system. Again, human rights are a part of that. Transparency is a part of it. I think when you look at the U.S. system, you have to put it all together. It works in part and its resilient in part because its so integrated, the political and the economic together. You cant take the politics out of the Chinese economic system. If you could, theyd be doing much better right now and theyd have a longer term trajectory that Id be much more supportive of.

Im Peter Goodman with the Huffington Post and former Shanghai bureau chief with the Washington Post. I want to get your thoughts on how the growth slowdown plays out in China. Does that cause the state to double down on the state-owned sector and hang onto control of the state-owned enterprises, or does it tend toward more liberalization in an attempt to get a little bit more vibrance out of the private sector?

The debate is when its going to happen and the speed at which the slowdown is going to happen. What the Chinese government is going to respond -- there are two paths. One is to double-down and to do the things theyve been doing, that is a lot of investment in infrastructure thats going to yield increasing returns and growth will continue to slow. And that will be a dead end. The other will be a very different trajectory; that is, to really become capitalist, which means to increase domestic consumption, to allocate capital much more efficiently, incidentally, in China, the capital market as we know it does not exist. Most of the savings is allocated through the state-controlled banking sector. So, theyve got to change that. And theyve got to privatize state-owned enterprises -- lots and lots of things that can be done to avert that kind of dramatic slowdown. But that means China will have to do capitalism.

And I do believe that the Chinese are going to see the error of their ways. And when they allow this change to happen, when they allow an appreciation in the value of their currency and they allow their citizens to more fully reap the rewards of their hard work and their savings, I think youre going to see a much greater growth trajectory in China. And I think a lot of some of the problems that were discussing here will go away as the Chinese economy is allowed to prosper and the government gets out of the way and lets it happen.

Most likely it will be inflation. I mean, it could be default, but the more likely outcome is that we simply print so much money that the bondholders are deprived of their purchasing power. And that is not a free market. A free market would have sound money. It wouldnt have the government issuing a currency by fiat and then deciding to punish savers at the expense of debtors, which is going to happen in the United States, especially when you realize that the U.S. government, being the largest debtor of us all, is going to benefit more from inflation than any other debtor.

And I think that part of the reason Im skeptical it will happen is because the U.S. government is so badly set up to do it. I mean, I cant even write an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and include the words industrial policy because its just a no-mans land. Nobody wants to talk about it. People in the State Department have said, Oh, we cant talk about industrial policy even though its kind of what were thinking about. And so we say economic statecraft. U.S. corporations dont want to coordinate with their competitors. They dont want to talk to the U.S. government on this stuff the way that in Japan you would if youre in the Keidanren. Japan has many -- the ministry of economy of trade and industry. In the United States, weve got Commerce, which is not exactly where we keep our best bureaucrats. And then weve got USTR, which is separate actually and much more capable. Youve got Energy, which is separate. Youve got the State Department which owns a lot of this but has very few people who have the background in the private sector, so the U.S. is very badly set up to do state capitalism, and I think that they wont. But I do think this is going to become an issue were going to debate a lot more in this country.

You know, I think what Ian said is very true. I was recently on the Vice President Xi's visit. And we went to California, and I was there with Governor Brown to meet him and meet a bunch of governors. Every one of those governors and party secretaries came with 10 guys in black suits, you know, for trade, for energy, for manufacturing. Brown had me, you know, a non-paid friend. And it was very evident to me that the state capitalism of China had this incredible sort of plug-in mechanism and we didnt have a socket. And I think thats going to have to change if we want to do business with China. These guys wanted to do business. They love California, and they cant find a way to do it. We need it.

This is the part of American capitalism that really works -- our innovation, our scaling -- our bringing stuff to market, scaling it up, Silicon Valley. And China does this less well, but I have to say Ive been around this block for a number of decades. And what I see happening in China is a lot of incredibly interesting self-made entrepreneurs bubbling up from underneath. Where they go, where the private sector of the economy goes, can it become the majority sector? That remains to be seen. But this is a very vibrant place. Don't write it off for one second.

You don't have to be innovative. But what you have to do is be able to take control of people and property and put them together and run a business in a way to generate a profit. And there are a lot of entrepreneurs making a lot of profit in China. They're not, not there. There are a lot of them, and the population of entrepreneurs is growing, and are self-made millionaires in China and more and more of them are being created, and that is going to continue. And that's a function of gaining more freedom and moving away from a centrally planned economy and grabbing more of free market principles. And as I said earlier, I think that as a young person in China wanting to start a small business, whatever it is, I think that young person in China is going to have a better chance of succeeding than his counterpart here. I think there'll be fewer obstacles placed in his path --

You cannot get into 14 other very important sectors because these are the sectors reserved for state owned companies. You cannot get bank loans. You don't have secure property rights.

My colleague partner, Minxin, just talked about all the things you couldn't do to set up in China in terms of entrepreneurship, but he didn't mention fruit stands. Those, you can, and perhaps there's a Tunisian model in the future for China. I think it's an interesting question. Look, I thought I would end with the future. You know, one of the things the United States does better than anyone else in the world is creative destruction. I like independent bookstores, but I tell you, when Amazon came along they got smashed. That may not be a society that you all want to live in. You may like independent bookstores. But its a society that does capitalism better. We see that all over the place. Creative destruction is what powers the American market. The single biggest game changing innovation in the world today is fracking and unconventional oil, that is changing the nature of global energy, it is overwhelmingly dominated by U.S. universities and research, U.S. entrepreneurs -- a bunch of Canadians in there, too, don't want to forget my friends to the north -- and U.S.-based multinational corporations. This matters. I know that the Chinese are doing more patents. They're small, they're engineering patents, there's a slight improvements on processes. Don't take away from them. They're very smart in China. They're being educated well. They're great. But if you want to talk about the game changing stuff that you want to bet on that's going to make the world work over the next 20 years, overwhelmingly that stuff is being driven in the United States of America. I don't know if it's Bill Gates's new battery technology that's going to work and be the next game changer, it's going to be in biotech, it's going to be in nanotech, but if you want to make that bet -- and, by the way, the Chinese central bank wants to make it, too -- you're going to make it here. I love the fact that we live in a society as well where broad ideologies can come together, work together, and make lots of money. I applaud the fact that we live in a place that a guy like Peter Schiff can make an enormous coin for himself, and I think you guys should, too. Thank you very much.

I think part of the problem having this debate at this particular point in time, it would kind of be like having a debate in 2005 over which country does real estate better, the United States or China. Because in 2005, everybody thought it was great in the U.S. with the housing market. Everybody was buying a house, even the people who couldnt afford them. Everybody had second homes and it was great. But of course it was a bubble and it couldnt last. And thats the same thing with the U.S. economy. If you want to look at the U.S. economy and measure it by how much money we spend and how much we consume. You look at some of these statistics that you reference about our competitiveness, when the reality is if were so competitive, where are all the products and why do we have a huge trade deficit? I think whats really happening here is we have a bubble in the entire economy and it is based on excess consumption, excess debt. The Chinese, theyre not making a big bet on the U.S. treasury market because they want to. Its because they think they have to. If they can wave a wand and replace all their treasures with gold, theyd do it. The problem is theyre afraid. Because they know if they try to sell, theyll crush the market. But we are on the verge of this collapse. And its because we abandoned all the principles of capitalism that we once had. And these are the principles that China is now adopting. As I said earlier, whats really more important is the pendulum and the direction in which its swinging. Look at where we started from complete capitalism. And China started, they had none of it. Look at how much ground weve surrendered and look at how much the Chinese have gained. Is China perfect? Not at all. They still have a lot of progress to make. But they are making that progress. The problem with us is were still moving in the wrong direction. And were moving in that direction more rapidly. And when we actually have our crisis; when we have a sovereign debt crisis, when the dollar really plunges and we really have to confront the grim reality of our situation, the fact that weve been living beyond our means for generations and it has to come to an end, then we can have this debate again. And I think well have a much different reaction in the audience as to how well America does capitalism.

We have to add one adjective. China does do a certain kind of capitalism better than the U.S. Thats crony capitalism. And I dont think Americans want to excel in that category. Because in China, under that kind of capitalism, you are not going to get clean air to breathe. Youre afraid to buy baby formula because if you have babies in the household, youd better go to Hong Kong to buy imported baby formula because crony capitalism cannot provide food safety. And if you are part of the elite, crony capitalism serves you really well. Because Ive read that elites in China are now installing air filtering systems in their cars, in their homes. But what about ordinary people? The vision of capitalism Peter champions is a vision of 19th century capitalism. Thank God America has come a long way and will not go back. Lets also imagine 20 years from now, which system will be there. I can safely bet, 20 years from now, democracy, democratic capitalism will still be around in the U.S. But can you say this about the Communist Party in China? In the next 20 years with this kind of capitalism? Im not so sure. My bet is that it will not be there. So at the end of the day, it will be American capitalism that triumphs over crony capitalism.

I really want to agree with you and I truly hope youre right. It would be nice. But who would have thought five or 10 years ago, that we would be sitting here tonight even having this debate, that there would be any kind of equilibrium even to discuss between these two great economic systems. No one. Twenty years ago, impossible. Thirty years ago when I first went to China, it was unthinkable. China is undeniably in transition. We are a more finished product trying to regain our balance. And I worry about the United States. I think we have a good model, but I think we havent played it very well. I think weve deceived ourselves. I think weve fallen into a lot of self deception about what has made this country great and strong. Its a combination between regulation and control and wisdom at the top setting an equitable and fair system and a free market with a vibrant set of entrepreneurs and innovators at the bottom. China is still trying to find its balance between these things. I dont know where theyre going to go. I dont know how its going to end up. I cant see the future for us or them, but I can see the last five or 10 years. And I think everyone in this room should acknowledge that despite all its imperfections, despite the human rights questions, despite all of these other things, that what China has accomplished, as counterintuitive as it was, no one could have predicted it, is pretty extraordinary. Something has been working pretty well. We dont know where its going to go in the future, and all we can do is sit and wait. But if we want to fix something, were not going to fix China. The question is are we going to fix ourselves.

Speaking for the motion, well have Eli Pariser. He is a pioneering online organizer and board president of MoveOn.org. His book, The Filter Bubble, three words, was the -- -- so easy, so easy -- was the inspiration for this debate. His partner booked is Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard and one of the countrys preeminent legal scholars. Hes been called the philosopher king of Internet law by the New York Times and the Elvis of cyber law by Wired Magazine. Against the motion, were going to have Evgeny Morozov who is a journalist and author of The Net Delusion. He bemoans what he calls slacktivism, which is defined by him as the tendency of the Internet to distract the population from any type of serious political engagement. And his partner, Jacob Weisberg, who first joined the online magazine Slate back in 1996 -- thats when people were just figuring out what the Internet was. And today he is the chairman and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group. I also want to say that we -- I think all of us with Intelligence Squared are delighted by the spirit with which this panel came to this debate tonight, the level of arguments, the fact that you stuck to ideas, that it didnt get nasty or personal but was thoughtful and provocative. I want to thank you for the way that youve conducted yourselves during this debate. And also, to the audience questions that were on point and really did help move this debate along, thank you to all of you who stood up and asked questions. Okay, and so I now have the results. Its all in. We have asked you to vote twice, once before the debate and once again after the debate. This is the final result on who wins this argument according to our live audience here. Our motion is "China does capitalism better than America. Before the debate, 17 percent of you were in favor of the motion, 50 percent against, and 33 percent undecided. After the debate, 9 percent are for the motion -- thats down 8 percent -- 85 percent support the motion -- thats up 35 percent -- 6 percent are undecided. The team arguing against the motion, "China does capitalism better than America, wins this debate. Our congratulations to them. And thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We will see you next time.

And it's been a terrific effort. And tonight it's a feather in his cap and our cap. So ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Rosenkranz.
Too many kids go to college|i2Debates/college.p|2|R0|ROBERT ROSENKRANZ|moderator|12|21|14|0|0|45|0|29|0|0|4|2|82|34|0|4|10|1|1|1|0|272|6|0|1|2|0|2|32|0|0|6|20|7|2|5|3|0|1|7|6|3|12|14|85|26|37|15|63|0|0|1|0|0|18|44|0|19|1|8|47|6|0|2|24|527|Thank you, and welcome. We're so pleased to be here in Chicago and proud to be a partner with the first Chicago Ideas Week. My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate, to outline the reasons we felt it was worth having. Tonight's motion is so counterintuitive one might wonder why we chose it as a topic. After all, there seems to be ample statistical support for the value of a college education. College graduates earn about $20,000 a year more than high school graduates, nearly half a million dollars over their lifetimes. Some 9.7 percent of high school graduates are currently unemployed compared with 4.2 percent of college graduates. So going to high school and not college doubles your chance of being unemployed. In a rapidly changing global economy, many of the traditionally high-paid jobs in manufacturing that high school graduates could get are gone forever. And employers are looking for the kind of cognitive skills that we normally associate with college graduates. And turning from material considerations, a liberal arts education is likely to produce a superior electorate, a more vital civil society, a citizenry with better understanding of American ideals and better ability to adapt to changing circumstances. And on a more personal level, a Chicago reporter asked me how I, transcending an obscure family background through scholarships to Yale and Harvard Law School, could possibly entertain tonight's motion. So what is the counter argument? It is that only a small percentage of high school graduates actually have the aptitudes to do well with colleges of reasonable quality. The majority of those enrolling in college lack the basic skills and aptitudes to take pleasure in the experience or otherwise to succeed. For such students, college becomes an extended adolescence and at best a remediation for inadequate high schools. But not a grounding of the essentials of cultural intelligence and such basic skills as expository writing or quantitative reasoning or scientific method or primary research. Might not such students get more from vocationally oriented education of the sort they would likely receive in such successful economies as Germany and Switzerland? In those countries, by the way, only about 20 percent or so complete four-year degree programs compared with double that figure in the U.S. And for the students at the very top of the scale, at the most elite colleges, might college prove an impediment to creative thinking or a distraction from their entrepreneurial drive? What lessons might we take from the extraordinary contributions of such college dropouts as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs? Well, your role tonight is to listen to the arguments, to question the panelists and ultimately to decide which side was more persuasive. Whatever you decide, I hope you will come away with the sense that on this issue, like so many others that seem at first blush to be one-sided, that there is an intellectually respectable position on both sides of the debate. And with that hope, I turn the evening over to our moderator John Donvan and this extraordinary panel of experts gathered for our first live debate in Chicago. Thank you, John.

And may I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible. True or false: Too many kids go to college? That's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan from ABC News. We are at Venue Six10 at the Spertus Center in Chicago. Too many kids go to college. Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, for it and against it. All of our debaters come to this from different perspectives, all of them are trying to win you over because you, our live audience, will act as the judges. And only one side will win. So let's meet our panelist of debaters. The motion being, "Too many kids go to college. " The team arguing for the motion include tech entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist, Paypal cofounder, Peter Thiel. His teammate is a political scientist who sees the Bachelor of Arts degree as a source of class division. American Enterprise Institute scholar, Charles Murray. Opposing them at the facing table and arguing that it's not true that too many kids go to college, one of Northwestern University's most transformative leaders, president emeritus, Henry Bienen. And joining him, an entrepreneur turned academic, he is also a columnist for the Washington Post, Vivek Wadhwa. So this is a contest. It's a debate. One side will win, and one side will lose. And you, our live audience, will hear them debate for three rounds, and then you will choose the winner by voting once before the debate and once again after the debate. So let's go to the first debate now. If you go to the key pads on your seats, only pay attention because on the right hand side is the one that's relevant to you. Pay attention only to keys number one, two and three. The others are irrelevant. If you agree with the motion that too many kids go to college, if, at this point, you agree with the side -- this side that's arguing that point of view, push number one. And if you disagree with this side, push number two. And if you're undecided, push number three. And if you think you made a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. So remember, we have three rounds of debate. After the third round of debate, we ask you to vote again, to tell us who you think presented the best argument. And the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner.

They are seven minutes each. These statements are uninterrupted. Our motion is "Too many kids go to college. " And speaking first for the motion, I'd like to introduce Peter Thiel who is making his way to the lectern. Peter Thiel changed our world and the way we do business by cofounding PayPal. He is the creator of that online payment system as well as an early investor in Facebook. You have now, Peter, stunned the world with your -- with your decision to offer grants of a $100,000 to people under 20 who forego college at least for a time to take on some sort of entrepreneurial task, which is going how?

Too many kids go to college|i2Debates/college.p|12|R2|PETER THIEL|for|7|80|40|0|0|81|1|151|4|0|16|17|286|102|0|31|56|0|0|7|0|860|13|4|0|2|0|24|82|0|1|24|117|0|4|25|30|1|2|10|50|5|30|87|177|139|213|53|167|0|0|5|0|0|99|88|0|57|12|49|222|34|5|14|50|1348|Thank you. Let me actually just start with that question. You know, I went to Stanford undergrad, Stanford law school. Throughout the '90s, I had a belief that education was absolutely paramount. We should only hire people that went to the best schools. And - - and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal. And I use this - - and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society. And over the last four or five years, I've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of different reasons. The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley, that I saw so many very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done extraordinary well. In some ways, they were also more creative. They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive but more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side. And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously. The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously. And so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago. College costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980. Even after inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent. Costs about four times as much. Inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation. And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I've come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech stocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30 years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it. And in '99 in Silicon Valley you couldn't question the NASDAQ valuations, and in 2005 you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society. And to question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three- year-old kids or something like that. And while we're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country. We had two already. They were catastrophically bad. They led to enormous misallocation of resources. And when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs. Student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000. And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many. The median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically. Pre-med, only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school. The other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out. If you broaden the ambit more generally, there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work. And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society. We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create more good paying jobs. We don't have enough of either in our society. And while education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing. And we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity. And in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound. And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit. Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for. We're not saying that nobody should go to college. We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing. We're not saying everybody should drop out. We're simply saying that too many people are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we shouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice. And what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future. Do not think of education as something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself. If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go to college even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead I'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the problems. But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, I would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything. The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake? And if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to get a refund?

Thank you very much. Our motion is "Too many kids go to college. And here to speak against the motion, Henry Bienen. He is president emeritus of Northwestern University. And Henry, in the nearly 15 years that you were there, the universitys success really was and is recognized as your success during those 15 years. The school increased its endowment 15 times. The sports team won more titles. Applications skyrocketed. You launched a Center for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly. Let Harvard eat that, right. But you know these guys at the other side are saying that youre a denizen of the system that they say is in a bubble. So youre going to need to impress them.

Thank you for coming. You gave a great speech this morning on the budget. This is an important debate. Its about the American dream. Its about social mobility and American democracy. Because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create. I care deeply about this issue. Im an educator, 28 years at Princeton, 14.5 years as Northwesterns president, now chair of a proprietary for-profit college, Rasmussen College, and a member of the Board of Education, appointed by the mayor for the Chicago Public School System. Sure, some dropouts make it big. But social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis, not anecdotal individual life histories, no matter how compelling. Most people are not Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. We should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in time as an indication of likely long outcomes. As Damon Runyon once said, The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but thats how the smart money bets. The argument that too many people are going to college is not new. In his youth, Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, argued this in The Overeducated American in 1976. He was wrong then, and our opponents are wrong now. And by the way, hes changed his mind. We now have studies and lots of information. Mr. Rosenkranz alluded to some of them, which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more years of school, post-secondary, are positively correlated with earning over ones lifetime, and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained. 4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed. More than triple that number of high school students or high school dropouts are unemployed. This is very compelling. Theres a clear wage premium to education. Theres also a social premium to society, not just individual. Society benefits through greater productivity, lower crime, better health, better citizenship for more educated people. And the wage premium to education has been growing since the 1980s, not shrinking. The question to be decided is whether its true that too many kids go to college. Fact: In 2010, about 66 percent of the United States population between 25 and 30 had some college experience. The rest were high school grads or high school dropouts. Its hardly the case that everyone or too many are pouring into college. We need more, not fewer, college graduates. Going to college in the United States, by the way, means very different things. From two-year community colleges, flagship public research universities, small denominational colleges, elite privates, and for- profits. By the way, at the for-profits, the average age of the students is 28, and these are not kids. Many of them are single mothers. Many are minorities. They dont choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great athletic teams or a climbing wall. They come to improve their careers, their income, their life chances, and they do. In his articles, Mr. Murray argues that too many people are going to college, and I feel he believes in innate qualities. He uses a language like, He does not have it in him. But how does he know this? What measures does he have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact? He believes, I think, that abilities are fixed. Its a highly stratified view of the world and peoples places in it, and I dont share it. True, plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready. We know this in Chicago. But low college graduation rates and dropout cannot be attributed everywhere and completely to individual's intelligence or competence. Even some qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out. No doubt, some people don't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed. But for many, their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not preparing them. We should not be so ready to consign them to what Mr. Murray may feel is their fate. Neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what, for many will be low-level jobs. Because for every college degree holder who is a janitor or a waitress, there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school dropouts. Mr. Thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college attendance and higher income. But he doubts the direction of causation. That is, college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it. In my view, whatever the direction of causation, you can learn skills at college and improve your life chances. And by the way, we have lots of studies, including studies of twins that Allen Kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself among all the other variables which count. And college does make a difference. Now, high school vocational alternatives are there, but they're not widely regarded as -- they're widely regarded as second best by the general public. Polls show that most Americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college. They support alternatives for other people's children. I wonder if those in favor of the proposition want their own children or relatives to not go to college. Mr. Thiel, Mr. Murray, I know Mr. Thiel has started this fund, and I applaud his generosity. It is very generous. Will he fund tens of thousands, millions? All the trend lines show a shift in the U.S. economy and its labor force towards more people requiring post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education. We've hollowed out industrial jobs. The clear way to premium for college graduates is growing. It skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. Advanced degree holders did vastly better, and their advantage continues to hold up. And by the way, for women, that wage premium is even higher than for men. I need to conclude, but I want to conclude by saying there are not many alternatives in the U.S. We don't have a vocational system like Switzerland or Germany. I'm not against building such a vocational system. I'd like to see more tracks that people can go to. But what we really need to do is do better in pre-K through 12. We cannot accept that too many kids go to college. In summary, those who go beyond secondary school are -- not all kids. There are not too many of them. I'm not willing to consign them to low-level jobs. We need to do better, and we can't give up on the American dream. Thank you.

" You have heard the first two speakers, and now onto the third. Charles Murray is the W.H. Brady scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. And Charles, you rather famously said that it was thanks to an SAT exam in 1961 and your fabulous score that you were able to get out of a small town in Iowa.

Your book, "The Bell Curve" despised by the left, and you like that. And I want to know where you are now on the SATs that got you out of Iowa.

When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA. I didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest. Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative. Almost everybody needs more education after high school. What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, antediluvian thing called a BA. The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil. Let's go through each of those accusations. First, fraudulent. The BA is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated person. You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more. The number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not -- don't exist. But it's much worse than that. If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know anything. If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what? They're transmuted into Bs. And why are they transmuted into Bs? Because the story they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can. And you've got to retain kids. And in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college. You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well. All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills. I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems. And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges. Knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much. Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering, okay. But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me. It doesn't really mean anything. Now, here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from. So if the applicant came from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college. You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in. You don't know anything about what Harvard has added. And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways. None of this should be news to any of you. The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education. Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless. Okay, destructive. Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one. And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA. The employers know how clueless many of them are. Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability. So they're being rational. But the problem is this: We have created a kind of self- fulfilling prophecy. We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy. And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper. It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study. They aren't there to get an education. They're there to get a piece of paper. It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential. It is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them. It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish. But most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture. We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity. We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise. Antediluvian. I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete. Four years is almost always too long. There's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work. A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that. The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing. What's the rationale for having a library these days? It used to be central. Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to millions? Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before. The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education. Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined. What we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where they learned it and how long it took them.

In fact, when I first stepped into it, it was ripping Peter Thiel's head off in an article I wrote for telling kids to drop out of college because it didn't make sense to me. You know, as an academic for the last six or seven years I've been researching what's happening globally. I've been researching the impact of globalization on U.S. competitiveness. I've been researching American schools versus other schools, and so on, and what makes America what it is, our competitiveness, immigration, those topics I've been researching. And when I step back from that, my conclusion is that these people in America are totally completely out of touch. If you read my writings, you'll see that I've been writing very controversial articles, each of them rip into a different aspect of American competitiveness because we don't get it. We're sitting here in our own little bubble disconnected from the rest of the world. Now, let -- I'm going to give you three perspectives on this. First of all, about U.S. education itself, believe it or not, U.S. education is by far the best in the world. Everyone is trying to be like us. People from abroad stake their life savings, all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in sending their kids to America because we've got the best schools. What do they gain from our schools? It's not the courses. It's really the knowledge. It's how to learn. You gain social skills. You learn how to interact with other people. You learn how to deal with failure, make compromises. You learn how to solve problems. These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out the best and the brightest in the world. This is why America is what it is. Now, another argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college. Charles has written a lot about IQ, IQ tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life. To me that's complete baloney. My whole life I've faced stereotypes because I happen to be a race that may not be very smart. In my youth my people were beggars and snake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot CEOs. In my lifetime I've seen the transformation of how people perceive me. So if I was going by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my people shouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to be successful, therefore, leave us out. You'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America. We don't know. I tell you if -- I know from my own children that they've gone through gyrations, so trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up. When they were young, they had some ideas. Now, if I had to decide when my sons were 16 years old, whether they would go to school or not based on their aptitude, it would be the worst decision I could possibly ever make because Id be wrong. Both of them decided to do completely different things than what they were talking about when they were young. Children dont know. So who are we? Who are parents to try to figure out whether they should get education or not? America is what it is because of our education system. America started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. We became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone. Now there are a lot of people left out as Henry talked about, but the solution to fixing Americas competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone. Now we can debate what a college is. To me, a community college is a college. A college -- you know, Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley where everyone thinks -- when they think college, they think Stanford. They think Berkeley maybe, so, one level below Stanford, but thats it. And when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt, $250,000 of debt. I know some great people who have gone to community colleges who have almost no debt, who worked part time, been able to pay their fees off. Our community colleges in this country are also colleges, and they too are better than the best -- they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the world. I dont know why we keep forgetting that. Now, I also taught, you know, I teach at several universities. I was at University, and my students brought up Peter Thiel. Hes quite a legend worldwide now. They were talking -- they said, Professor, is there really an American investor whos paying children to drop out of college? I mean, they were so confused. At the end of it, we talked about it, and they said, You know, this is great because were going to eat their lunch. This is what they were thinking. They didnt say it. But this is whats happening in the world right now. Just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children, the rest of the world has learned our trick. India and China are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year. Theyre educating all their people because they know that its going to make them like America, and theyre going to eat our lunch. So if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that, were going to lose out. You talk about entrepreneurship, again -- again, I have a lot of respect for Peter Thiel while chatting with him, but, you know, he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and be very successful. Fine. Therere 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in America who dont need to go to college. I have researched this systematically. What we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the same world that Peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a Bachelors degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees. In terms of success, thats how much difference education makes. Now, the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesnt matter what school you graduate from. The tech founders in America, the most successful people in America graduated from a wide assortment of universities. There are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did. It didnt matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from Harvard. You could still make it big as an entrepreneur. Why? Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn. Now, moving forward, the Indians and Chinese are going to be eating our childrens lunch, guaranteed. Ive researched it enough to know that we have a lot to worry about. If we disarm right now and stop teaching them, were going to become like they used to be. They are absolutely going to demolish this country. And whats going to happen is that globalization is going to wreak havoc on industries. Already were talking about manufacturing. Were talking about several industries now going offshore. Its going to happen more and more. Were going to have to keep constantly reeducating our workforce. Ten years from now, were going to have to have massive retraining programs for our workforce. If you dont even have a Bachelors degree, if you dont even have basic education, youre beyond hope. These people may be end up, you know, waiting tables at restaurants, but were going to have too many of those. We need to provide our workforce with a basic education. I say wed have to have every American getting at least a Bachelors degree and encouraging them to do Masters and Ph.D.s.

The team arguing in support of that motion, Peter Thiel and Charles Murray, are arguing that college can be a drag, a waste of time for the very talented and for much of the rest of the students who are pursuing BAs, they are pursuing what has been described as a worthless document, the Bachelor of Arts degree, meaningless document, the Bachelor of Arts degree. The team on the other side that include Henry Bienen and Vivek Wadhwa are arguing that, number one, going to college is part of the American dream, that those who go to college do better financially and otherwise than those who do not. And from a competitive point of view, we will be falling behind the rest of the world if we accept the notion that we need to limit, in some way, the numbers of people going to college. I want to put a question to the side that's arguing for the motion and take on that American dream question. And Peter Thiel, I think Henry Bienen used the term, we do grow up with the notion -- I think you've acknowledged it that in fact you felt straight-jacketed by it, that you do go to college because you're supposed to go to college. And yet the other side is arguing that that's part of the dream, part of the American dream. So take that on, because it's -- I think that they're onto something with that.
Too many kids go to college|i2Debates/college.p|37|R3|PETER THIEL|for|0|23|11|0|0|25|0|39|0|0|4|3|55|25|0|6|6|0|0|1|0|218|2|0|0|0|0|2|16|0|0|9|35|0|4|5|8|1|0|0|11|2|8|15|37|42|58|13|33|0|0|2|0|0|22|18|0|9|0|10|59|6|1|2|18|320|Well, it certainly was not historically part of the American dream. So if you looked at how many people went to college in the U.S. in the 19th or early 20th century, it was a very, very small percentage. And it was -- this is a very recent phenomenon that this is seen as an absolute necessity. And I think in many ways I would actually flip it around, and I would say, what's gone wrong with the American dream that we have to have people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past. People don't need college degrees for many of the jobs that we have. There are many good jobs where you don't need them, many bad jobs. People get stuck with college degrees. But I'd actually flip it around. This whole question of what sort of a good is college. Is it an investment in your future? I don't think it's a good investment because it's costing too much, and there's no -- seemingly no accountability whatsoever from the other side on the costs. It was absolute good, any price. Pay no attention what the price is. Is it a consumption decision? And I sort of have joked that it's like a four-year party. And I think that's kind of true, but I think people are too stressed out to really have a four-year party when they're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they're going to be debt slaves for the rest of their lives or for the next 10, 20 years. And so I think the way to think of it is that it's basically become an insurance policy because the cracks in our society have become so big. And we need to be asking why are so many people having to pay more and more for insurance and what's gone wrong that we're paying so much for insurance.

I'd be quite happy to talk about cost. A lot of the sticker price is discounted, as you know, through very substantial financial aid. Plus I also took literally the topic of college which means lots of low-cost colleges Vivek and others and myself pointed out. I don't think it's a nightmare for people. I think most people come out of a college experience feeling better. In fact, there's even surveys about how do you feel. You feel better as a person. And it's quite positive. I think of it as a consumption good but not as a full-time party for four years. No doubt there are some people who do that. Woe to them. But it's a consumption good in that there's something good in and of itself of learning about beautiful things and learning more analytical ways of thinking. It was Steve Jobs himself, the late Steve Jobs, who said when he came back after dropping out of Reed and sat in on courses, he took a calligraphy course. And that calligraphy course gave him a whole new world of thinking about design. Who knows what, in the college experience will trigger for people thinking about the world in a different way.

But -- but seriously, is there -- are we putting dollar and cents measurement on something that needs to be measured more broadly than that?

I'm coming at it -- again, let's go back to the American dream thing. In 1960, which wasn't that long ago for somebody as old as I am, only eight percent of American adults had college degrees. So college was a big deal then. But 92 percent didn't, including most of the successful people in this country. Not having a college degree had no relationship to the American dream at all at that time. College did have prestige. But you didn't look down on somebody who hadn't gone to college. And one of the things we don't like to say any more, but it is absolutely true, is we do now. If you are just a high school graduate, you are a second class citizen in this country. That is a kind of destruction of the American dream that I think it's becoming like a caste system where if you go not just to college but to an elite college, the doors will open and you are going to be a success, and you don't give into that --

Look at the rise of America relative to its education. We rose -- in the '50s and the '60s, we were coming out of the war. It was a different era. Over the last 50 or 60 years, we've become the only world super power. Yes, the economy is in the tank right now. Yes, things are bad. We'll come out of it. This country keeps reinventing itself because it has smart people who can think outside the box that -- who can reinvent themselves over and over again. Yes, there're some outliers who can't. But the average American can reinvent him or herself, and that's what makes this country what it is. Bachelor's degrees, if we want to declare bachelor's degree are irrelevant, then let's invent something new. But we're not going to be able to change the system like that. Like you said, if we outlaw bachelor's degrees, we're going to declare defeat to the rest of the world because the rest of the world has caught the American dream. Those Chinese students I talk about, they are just like my students here at Duke and at Berkeley. They're just like the students we meet over here. They read the books. They follow us. They understand what we're doing. They want to get those bachelor's because they want to get master's, and they want to get PhDs. That's how it is. So forget about our vision of the American dream. We're now a small part of the world. Our economy is becoming a decreasing part of the world. We're going to be competing like you won't believe over the next 10, 20, 30 years.

So I think there obviously are a lot of things that are very admirable about India, China. People have a great work ethic. They're thinking very much about the future. And I do not want to at all underestimate how serious the competition is or to encourage people to be complacent. But the proposition we're debating today, do too many kids go -- are too many kids going to college, and if you look at those countries, the percentage is much smaller, and it is -- I looked these numbers up because I figured -- I thought you might make this argument. And the U.S. -- about 40 percent of college-aged students are in college. And of course there are a lot of them that end up dropping out. It starts at more than 40. But on average, 40 percent are in college. In China, the number is 20 percent. In India, the number is 10 percent. And if you want to look at China and India, it is a brutally selective system. Very few people can get in. People are worked incredibly hard once they're in college. And if we want to be more like them, the first thing -- simple approximation is you have far fewer people go to college. And this is true of any other country in the world you'd look at. And so if the U.S. should take its bearings from other countries, that is a very powerful argument for our side.

Yes, it's a smaller percent of the population. But look at the industry in which everyone is moving, technology, engineering. 1.5 million versus about 100, 150,000 of ours. They're eating our lunch. India has become a $80 billion IT industry which came out of nothing at all the last 15 years. How? By educating its people. Zero to $80 billion in 15 years.

Robotics are going to take over manufacturing in the next ten years or so. So those jobs which could be menial jobs that you could have non-educated people doing, they're going to disappear. It's become a knowledge economy where everyone has to now do intelligent things or they're unemployed.

And sometimes it's a great scientist and sometimes it's a great artist and sometimes it's a great craft person.

We were told by the other side that we shouldn't look at anecdotes like Zuckerberg or Gates or Jobs and I agree those are exceptional cases, and there obviously are all sorts of people who have idiosyncratic things that can happen in college. They can also happen outside of college. Socialization does not have to happen in college. People should learn how -- this is again a really bizarre recent phenomenon, you know, 92 percent of people did not go to college in 1960, they were able to be citizens, they were able to vote, they were able to be -- we wouldn't say nobody should have voted in 1960 because they didn't have college degrees. That would have been an invidious thing to say.

But were the research generators of the world in American universities today. Bell Labs is gone. The big pharmas have offshored their research. Weve adopted those costs. Now, not every university is a research university. Its not a Northwestern or a Duke or a Stanford, but I want to speak to the question of cost directly since our opponents, though I dont think its the subject of the debate. But you know, we dont have to induce anybody to come to Northwestern. We get 33,000, 34,000 applicants for something like an entering class of 2,000 students. So -- and that is true of the elite universities. Not all universities look like that. Thats true. And there is this range of places, which weve tried to talk about. If you believe in demand at all, people are still voting with their feet. And by the way, its foreigners who are voting with their feet because they want to come to American universities for the Ph.D. level. Weve talked about undergraduate education a lot. But theres something else that universities do out there, or at least certain kinds of universities which are very, very important. Its a very important function for the place that I --

What percentage? And where would they be going to school?

Somebody wants to go into business, so they have some marketing courses they want to take and some business administration and accounting courses. Takes them a year and a half. And they finish all the courses they want to take, and then there is a good certification exam, like the CPA exam for accountants. They take that exam, which doesnt have to consist of just filling in dots and circles. It can be work samples. It can be a variety of things, but you can take that to the employer and say, Heres what I know academically about business.

I dont believe -- for example, take distance learning. I suspect were probably on the same page. I think youre going to see more distance learning, even at the major four-year universities. Its going to happen. People can take a statistics course online. Im chairman of the board of a company called Ithaca Harbors where were doing research on how people learn online. Maybe they learn statistics online as well as being in a classroom. Maybe they can even do Econ 101 like that. I dont know. Well see. Im for experimenting. Our law school went from everybody in a three-year law school program to some people in a two-year program. I think the great universities will change. They should change. Not everybody has to be in a bricks-and- mortar place. Online, for-profits, can be solely online or 70 percent online courses. So we ought to think about this in a flexible way. I dont disagree with Charles and Peter on that.

There are certain skilled people, very talented people. Not every talented person should go to Harvard. You know, there are a lot of different kinds of things different people should do. And I think that's sort of a basic starting point. We don't believe there is a single straight jacket. And the crazy thing in our society is that the more talented you are, the narrower the straight jacket has become. This is a very, very bizarre feature of it. We also agree that learning is generally a very good thing. And we agree that we should be -- I think we all four of us agree on that. But there's a bit of a disagreement that I don't want to understate, is that a great deal of what masquerades as learning is nothing more than credentialing. And the basic numbers I've seen is that it's something like 90 percent credentialing, 10 percent learning if you try to sort of break the numbers out. If you got into Harvard versus finishing high school, let's say you make 30,000 a year out of high school, 60,000 a year out of Harvard. Let's say it's two to one, something in that ballpark. You get to 45,000, if you were good enough to get into Harvard, that's the selection. And you get to 57,000 if people knew you got into Harvard, that's the signaling. So 90 percent is credentialing. And the learning gets you from 57 to 60. We're in favor of that 10 percent. But it is outrageous how it's been conflated with this credential which is being parasitically charged to people in this way-- costs have escalated and escalated and escalated.

Katherine Ibata-Arens, professor of international political economy and expert on Asian entrepreneurship from DePaul university. I enjoyed this talk quite a lot. I'm an alum of Northwestern, so it's a great pleasure to see Dr. Bienen who was the president while I was a doctoral candidate there. It's a great pleasure to be with all of you tonight. My question is something that has not come up in the debate, and that is social networks. I do analysis of high-tech gazelles all over the world, and I find that the social networks that individual entrepreneurs obtain while they are in the K through 16 pipeline, particularly while they're at universities and/or graduate schools are absolutely critical for them getting, one, trusting business partners, their first business partners, and two, angel investments. So I'd like for both sides to comment on the quality of the social networks that you get while you're in university.

It's still not clear that it justifies charging a quarter million. I think the social networks tend to be the most valuable only at the elite colleges. Once you go below that level, they actually function in a way where people, again, do not have access. So I think you have a very ambiguous aspect about how it works. In practice, in Silicon Valley, most of the companies do get started by people who are a few years out of college. And I tend to think that when I started PayPal, there were some people I brought in from Stanford, but I started with a colleague who--we met in a different social context in Silicon Valley. And we'd gone to different schools, so it ended up being somewhat -- my own experience was different. But I do think elite colleges have a social networking value. That's a very oddly different thing from what we've heard here. That's very different from that its about learning, that it's about turning people into citizens or anything like that. And it seems to me that even if that's true, it should cost way, way less.

Peter keeps talking about a quarter million dollars. That's Stanford. The rest of America is not Stanford. Most colleges are much, much cheaper. And the direction the students have are the same. It's not that the elite, you know, students at Stanford have a big advantage over the others. It's just that they happen to have gone to a nicer campus. So the social network is equally important no matter where you go. Now, the other thing is that if you don't go to college, if you drop -- forget about dropping out. If you went directly from high school to work, you're going to have a very junior position in some big company or some startup where you have very limited interaction with anyone else. You're not going to build social skills. You're not going to have a network greater than the handful of people that you happen to work with in your department. I don't know how many of you worked in big companies or any companies. But it's always to people you're exposed to. When you're in college, you're interacting with lots and lots of people all across the board. It's those interactions that define you. That can't be quantified. But that's what carries you through your whole life. You get to meet diverse people. It's not just people who happen to work in the same field and the same company that you do. So the kids that are dropping out and starting their own startups, they're going to be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. I don't know what they're going to be 30 years from now because they haven't had that social interaction which defines human beings. We need that. We need that extra three or four years where you get to stabilize and learn and become who you are and decide what you want to be when you grow up.

And I can say that even if they do not know what they wanted to do professionally or work wise, you could say they weren't particularly interested in reading books and learning. And this was not their talent. That's not what they were psyched to do. And there is something crazy about saying everyone has to be locked into a room and read books and -- and that's what we have to do.

But I think the solution is unfounded. I don't think the solution is actually that you should deter kids from actually going to college. I think your frustration comes from the fact that there are fundamental reforms that need to be made to higher education. In my opinion, it should in some way mirror the reforms that are happening in charter schools.

And I think there are a lot of market forces working in that direction because the B.A. really is meaningless. And employers do know that it tells them extremely little. Whereas if they could get some strong indication that the kid sitting in front of them has actually learned something about things that are relevant to the job they're going to have, that would be good for them. And it would level the playing field. Let me repeat, I do not see our college campuses having fewer people on them, I see it having as many or more but not locked into the B.A. straightjacket.

Can you take that on? Is it too much of the default's position?

So I'm not against having vocational streams in high schools, for example Westinghouse High School here, a relatively new high school, is an interesting place. It has both a high performance stream and a vocational stream. See, Mr. Mayor, you send me to these places, I try to learn something about them. So that's okay with me. I'm not against that. I'm not against for more on the job training. Only 10 percent of our labor force has what the Swiss and the Germans would call on the job training. I'm not against that. Americans have decided they didn't want to go in that direction, they didn't want to stream the kids in high school really early. But I think it's not a terrible option at least to open it up.

My question is that it seems to me that in the -- with the invention of the Internet, technology, globalization, there seems to be less and less a concrete set of skills that people need to be successful in the world. There's much more like what a liberal arts education I think maybe focuses on developing critical thinking skills. And so how would a shift from a liberal arts or sort of a more a broader education to more concrete courses, focus on a very specific skill set, change the ability of our society to innovate and to continue to respond to changing demands?

The most concrete skill oriented education people get is engineering degrees, and that is actually probably the one area and we may even agree on this where I think the U.S. does not have an excess of engineers. But that is something that's specific and tracked and engineering is specific and that's what people get paid for the most. And as we were heading into a more technologically oriented world, that's actually -- there's going to probably be an increasing premium on engineering and on specific types of skills. And if I had to give people advice and they were set on going to college, you should study engineering or some form of engineering unless you are in a really unusual situation and really passionate about something else. So I would sort of quibble with the question on that level.

He was really against too many kids going to get four-year B.A. at expensive colleges. I dont think thats really a mis-description, but so much of this conversation from Peter and Charles has been a focus where theyre negative about the general B.A. or presumably the humanities and social sciences. So let me speak up for the humanities and social sciences. So there are lots of smart people who think analytically and rigorously who take the humanities and social sciences, who are art history majors, God love them, and who are historians and who learn Arabic and who learn Chinese, or who learn Hindi or who learn whatever. And were going to send lots of those people. They need to have those languages. They need to learn cultures that are different from the U.S. Theyre going to be business people who go abroad. Theyre going to be diplomats, whoever they may be, so why should we only think that the only place to get an education which is rigorous, analytical, and will serve you well is going to be in the engineering, mathematics --

My name is Irene and Im a final-year physics college student. And my question is, as a society, weve grown up with the notion of the importance of a well-rounded individual which is why a number of four-year Bachelor programs in the U.S. have a substantial amount of unrelated course work that has nothing to do with a persons major. On the other hand, Europe, which recently adopted the three-year Bachelor system a couple of years ago, has much less of that unrelated, more well- rounded amount of coursework and more focus on the concrete, actual coursework that pertains to ones major. And my question to you is which system do you think has an advantage in the future?

If its to take The Epic Film from Ben Hur to Lord of the Rings, its not so great. So what we have as course requirements in this country, it just doesnt fit this image you want to see of people sitting Aristotle and the classics and the rest of it. Its not the curriculum.

The data shows, and the data is conclusive on this, that it's not just getting a degree which increases your life chances and your income. In fact, even in community colleges, which are basically two-year places, if you're in there for a period of time like one semester, you have a better chance, and you'll earn more money than if you never went. And this is true of two-year, four-year colleges, whatever. So it's -- if you look at this, it's almost linear that the more time you spend in college, irrespective of whether you get a degree, pays off for you. Now, there is a sheepskin effect at around 16 years. But it's a little bump. It's not a huge bump so --

It's not so clear often what's correlation and what's cause. On this one, I think we have lots of studies which show that when you try to normalize or hold account for all the other variables, and there are lots of them; family background, environment, even intelligence. I mean, some people are smarter than other people. That's a fact of life. Whatever you do, you still find a college effect. But the point I was making to this question, John, because I think it's a very important question, that -- and even if you look at debt, if you look at the number of years in college or the number of even months in college, it's extraordinary. It pays off.

But I want to quibble a little bit more with the idea of the data shows and what this means. And we're always looking backwards. And so 2005, you could have said the data shows that housing prices always go up. And they are less likely to go up if they've gone up a lot. And so what I will tell you as an analytic truth, not an empirical truth, when people are paying way more than they ever have, there are going to be more people who have been hurt than who were hurt in the '50s or '60s, when it was effectively free. And so -- and this will not be seen in advance. You will see this in 10, 15, 20 years time. You're starting to see it with college students, have to move back in with their parents because they cannot afford to get their own place and pay off their debts.

And there are many cases where it's not true. And I basically think it's sort of -- we see it unravel over four or five years as you have one class after another graduate, and there are no good jobs, even for the people with college degrees. I would say it's different from housing because there's no specific market. You can't precisely evaluate a college degree. And that's actually one of the things that makes it a much more pernicious bubble than housing because it will not pop instantly, and therefore it's likely to be actually even more pronounced and more extreme before it unravels.

I'm exploration and a graduate of the University of Chicago. We've heard lots of reasons to go to college. Most of it has been about work and economics, a little bit about the need to meet diverse people, be exposed to things we might not see before. In the spirit of the debate, could you clarify what it is you think college is actually for? What's the end or purpose of college?

I think it's what you make of it. I think it can be sometimes very focused. It can be, as Vivek has said, people don't know what they want to do until they get there. You learn, how do I know what I want to be until I grow up. I don't have a handy dandy formula. I think it's a good question, but I don't think there's an answer to it that it should be this or that because people are so diverse. They come with different interests, different experiences, different backgrounds. And they grow presumably in those -- in those years in college. And many of them find themselves. They get sparked by different things. I don't know what's going to spark somebody's interest. I mentioned for Steve Jobs it was a calligraphy course he stepped into. For somebody, it may be reading Shakespeare. It may be looking at beautiful paintings. It may be listening to beautiful music. It may be all of a sudden math grabs them, and they didn't know what they could do.

My name is Layla Dolsin , and I'm currently an MBA student at the University of Chicago. We've heard that -- or some of you have compared college education to a bubble. And I'm sitting here wondering whether it might not be a bubble but rather inflation. The same kind of healthy inflation that you would experience with inflation of GDP as the economy grows. So what I'm wondering is, do you feel like high school education, in the same way that it might have been sufficient for society in the '60s, is also sufficient for society today. Thank you.

I do think that a great deal of what we talk about as a liberal education can be done at the K-12 level. There are things like the core knowledge curriculum that's created by E.D. Hirsch, which is just wonderful. And it doesn't teach everybody a full-fledged classical education, but it -- it gets a lot of the common cultural knowledge for everyone in K-12. We aren't doing it in college. I think we could do it there.

My name is Phil Pappus . When I was young, I read that majority of the CEOs in Fortune 500 companies only had a high school education. Due to the deterioration of secondary education in the United States, isn't college, a college degree, a necessity to show that you have something that was once called a high school degree?

And I have to say that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. And here is where we are. We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater. The statements will be two minutes each. They will be uninterrupted. And remember, you voted before the debate, and this is their last chance for them to try to convince you that they have argued most persuasively. And you'll be asked to vote once again and choose a winner just a few minutes from now. So onto round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. Our motion is this: "Too many kids go to college. " And here to speak against the motion, Henry Bienen, president emeritus of Northwestern University.
Too many kids go to college|i2Debates/college.p|200|R4|HENRY BIENEN|against|3|28|15|0|0|25|2|44|0|0|4|10|69|23|0|3|13|0|2|0|0|251|4|0|2|0|4|7|14|0|0|7|47|0|2|8|11|0|0|2|7|4|14|25|49|50|76|16|36|0|0|0|0|0|34|20|0|10|9|3|64|6|6|1|14|368|Well, no one seems to doubt, including our opponents, that there is a wage premium and a benefit to college. They may have some confusion about what kind of college, whether they're expensive or not, though the debate was not about cost, as I understood it. Mr. Thiel raises, I think, interesting points about causation, the direction of causation. But I think it's clear also that going to college isn't of itself an effect. It's a variable which moves people along in their lives, gives them more chance and gives them more income, independent of all the other things that get them to college in the first place. Now, yes, there are too many people who are unprepared that go to college. And I agree with what Peter said at the very last minute, that it would be a perverse effect to say, okay, college is going to be remedial for the lousy high school education that they got. The answer to that, which we're trying very hard to do in Chicago, is to improve the K through 12 elementary and high school education. And that's key. That is key to society as it is to make sure that higher education is good and affordable for all. So the answer is not that too many kids go to college any more than it would be too many kid go to high school or elementary school because they don't get a good education in too many of those places, and I'm sure there are plenty of colleges where they don't get a good education, sure, I'm sure that's the case. I've just never been in any of them but I know that they exist. So I think the answer is very clear and that you have to decide in the negative on the proposition that too many kids go to college. That is after all the proposition, it's not about costs, it's not about whether everything is perfect, at every college in the country, it's not about whether we should do everything exactly how we've done it, it is the proposition that too many kids go to college, and the answer is clearly and unequivocally that's a wrong answer.

There's a little bit of a lag on that one, but our motion is "Too many kids go to college," and here to summarize his position in support of the motion, Peter Thiel. He is PayPal cofounder who's 20 Under 20 Fellowship Awards grant cash to young tech entrepreneurs.
Too many kids go to college|i2Debates/college.p|202|R4|PETER THIEL|for|1|23|2|0|0|25|0|41|0|0|1|5|42|11|0|5|9|0|0|0|0|229|7|0|0|1|0|2|12|0|0|4|21|0|3|5|10|0|0|2|6|0|0|20|51|47|41|10|34|0|0|0|0|0|36|16|0|3|5|10|65|3|0|9|18|338|The one thing that was clearly not done by the other side was to answer my question about where would the accountability be for all the people who get hurt by the system that costs too much and is not delivering. And it is clear to me that there is no accountability on the part of our education establishment. They're not willing to give people refunds. They're not -- if you get a Ford and it blows up, a Ford Pinto blows up, you can go to the Ford company, you can get money back for your car, you might even be able to sue them for torts, such a mentality is unthinkable in the college case. And given that there is this lack of accountability, buyer beware. You are on your own. You take on the loans. It's worse than housing debt. You can never get out of it, not even through bankruptcy. Bush amended the bankruptcy laws in 2005 so you cannot get out of college debts for the rest of your life. And you need to think about this on your own. The way bubbles end is when people start thinking for themselves. And that is the first thing we want to encourage people to do is not to simply go with the social pressure, not to go with the bill of goods, "This has always been done. This is automatic. This is necessary. This is globalization. " But think for yourself, "Is the cost worth the benefit? " And when more people think for themselves about this, we will get to a very different equilibrium where there's less of a caste system, less of a social need to do these things for status reasons, people will still go to college, they will still get advance degrees, but there will be fewer of them who do it because there are a lot of people who are doing it for the wrong reasons, and I think that will be a much healthier and more balanced country.

What I heard from the other side was that if we define college the way Middle America does, then we actually are agreeing that we want more kids to go to college, so I'm not going to spend my two minutes on that. I want to actually challenge my new friend, Peter Thiel, on something which is very dear to his heart, about the fact that it's so expensive to go to college. That I agree with him on. And it's also antiquated. The system's antiquated. Peter and I are both associated with a great university called Singular University, which is on campus, where we teach about exponential technologies, how all these advances are happening which can change the world, impact the lives of billions. Well, you know, think about it, five or 10 years ago did you ever use an iPhone or an Android? None of us did. I'll bet you everyone in the audience has one today. The fact is that it's now possible to communicate in ways we could never do before. We have these tabular devices which can deliver 3D simulations, take us into 3D worlds. We can teach people by taking them into games. We can change the entire concept of education. He has the ability to do that. He has done it before with social network, with Facebook, he's done it with PayPal. He has the ability to do this. Instead of investing in silly little social media technologies, why don't we put our joint efforts into improving education if it's changing the way we deliver, to change the way we educate -- -- and changing the world. I tell you, Peter, you can make it happen. So I challenge you here publicly to put your energy into improving education, into automating, into rethinking the way we educate so that the masses can get educated because all of us agree that we do want more people to go to whatever we call college. Again, I'm not going to define it as a four-year degree, again to get more education so we can be more competitive, we can take on the world, we can change the world together. We're going to need it more than ever over the next few decades.

Its not a very good thing to say in a debate. But suppose we got rid of the B.A. because it doesnt mean anything. Suppose we had as the goal of education not this piece of paper, but we had as a goal of education that all children shall reach adulthood having discovered things they love to do and having learned how to do them well. If we take that as the goal of education, we will have a system utterly different from the one we have now, and it will not be college as we know it. It will not be four years, and a lot of times, it wont be residential. And most of all, it will not separate people into those who are college graduates and those who are not. And the fact is that every career goes through a couple of phases. We all start out as apprentices. And after we learn our trade, we become journeyman. And some of us who get really good at it become master craftsmen. That is just as true of a history professor or a lawyer or a physician as it is of a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician. The kinds of changes we need to make to our educational system, sweeping, fundamental reforms, getting rid of the B.A., moving to certifications, has as its ultimate goal, in my view, something that is very important for America as it is increasingly stratified by class. And that is that it promotes a recognition among us that we are all engaged in the same process. We are not divided into professionals and service workers or blue collar workers. We all start out as apprentices. We become journeyman, and we all strive to become master craftsmen. Thank you.

Were asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote. Were asking you to judge on this motion, "Too many kids go to college. Which side presented the stronger arguments? Press number one if you feel this side, arguing too many kids go to college, presented a better argument. Press number two if it was this side. Press number three if you are or became undecided in the course of the debate. And well have the results in about 90 seconds from now. So before I announce the results of that debate, I just want to first of all thank our panelists for coming here with the attitude and the kind of argument that we encourage. They were terrific. And I want to say something about the questions that were asked here tonight. I really wish that I could import you folks back to New York. Because we had a lot of trouble with the question situation there, and you all really got the message. And there wasnt a bad one among them. And so thank you very much, and thanks to the audience for all of that. So this is our first debate in the city of Chicago, and it was our second outside of New York. And we want to thank very, very much the organizers of Chicago Ideas Week for inviting us to be a partner program with them. And we also want to spend a very, very huge thanks to Grosvenor Capital Management who underwrote tonights debate for us and made the whole thing possible. Thank you. So we are -- we head back to New York. We have two more debates in the fall season. You can actually watch those online, as this one, its been streamed by our media partner, Slate. It will be 5:45 p.m. in Chicago on our debate days. And this is what were doing. On October 25, were debating the motion, Congress should approve Obamas jobs plan. The panelists at this point include the chief economist at Moodys Analytics and also a former economic advisor to President Obama. On November 15, our motion is "The world would be better off without religion. And our panelists then include a rabbi and Charles Darwins great-great grandson. Streaming at 5:45 on Slate.com. You can find a full listing of the panelists for these debates in tonights program, which you should have all been handed on the way in. And if you happen to be in New York for any of these, tickets are still available for some of them, for both of them. And for updates on future debates, you can go to our website. You drop a business card in one of the boxes on your way out, and we will follow up with emails on how you can get in touch with our website. Were on Twitter, future debates by doing that. All of our debates can be heard on NPR stations across the country, including WBEZ here in Chicago. So if you tune in, youll hear your own applause, which makes it all worthwhile. All right now, these debaters have been arguing the motion "Too many kids go to college. Weve asked you to listen to these debates as they went through three rounds. You voted before the debate and once again afterwards to tell us where you stood when you came in and which side you feel argued best. So here are the results. The motion, "Too many kids go to college. " Before the debate, 39 percent supported the motion, 40 percent were against, and 21 percent undecided. After the debate, 47 percent are for the motion for the side for the motion. That's up eight percent. Against is 46 percent. That's up six percent. Undecided seven percent. The side arguing for the motion, just barely wins this debate. Our congratulations to them. And thank you from me, John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.

Well, I don't mean to be a name dropper, but last week I posed our resolution to two of my dinner partners, Rupert Murdoch and George W. Bush. They both had strong views, and both were against the motion. Murdoch was vehement that FOX News is not polarizing, but presents -- -- but presents a more balanced view than the other networks and attracts an audience that is 40 percent Democrat, which I thought was an interesting statistic. And President Bush argued that in most of the world, the internet has opened minds to the way of life in the liberal democracies and has been a hugely constructive force for change. He acknowledged the extreme polarization of American politics, but blamed it on the class warfare rhetoric of his successor. Whenever one thinks of their points, they do illuminate some of the subtleties in the language of our resolution. Murdoch correctly grasped that it does not posit that the internet is the sole or even the primary driver of the narrow ideologies that seem to dominate politics. Rather, he understood the internet as part of a broader trend toward a highly fragmented media. And President Bush, by taking the resolution in a global context, prompts me to clarify that what we expect to talk about tonight is American politics. Why might be the internet be closing our minds? The first reason is that the internet makes it very easy to tailor the information we get to conform to a preconceived world view. We can choose news aggregators on the left or on the right, not to mention highly ideological bloggers and live our lives without encountering any contrary opinion. In a great little essay called, "Why Groups Go to Extremes," Cass Sunstein, the Obama administration's regulatory czar, demonstrated empirically that discussing issues with like-minded folks tends to make positions more extreme. In addition to self selection, the internet makes it easy for websites to, "personalize our offerings. " It seems innocuous, even helpful when Netflix tells us that the viewers who enjoyed movie A also enjoyed movie B. But if you Google federal deficit or Medicare reform, is it healthy for your search to come up differently than mine based on what Google has been able to infer about our political leanings? Those against the motion will argue that the internet is a vast information utility which facilitates search, learning and communications. Personalization may be a blessing, simply helping us make the choices we want to make. We can turn personal filters on or off, so there's no real danger here. And little hard evidence that Google has helped us erect mental fortresses through which contrary ideas are not allowed to penetrate. Indeed, the filters from the pre-internet era, three like-minded networks and a handful of local newspapers, were arguably less hospitable to views outside American census than the open marketplace and information and ideas we have today. To illuminate the complexities here, we have four distinguished experts, and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.

Thank you. And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for the benefactor of this series, Robert Rosenkranz. Yes or no to this statement: "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " The state of the online debate, that is what we're debating here tonight. Welcome from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan. We have four superbly qualified debaters, two against two. And what we're touching on here -- well, it starts with this, a sampling of this, and see if it's familiar. This is a recent exchange among Wall Street Journal readers who were posting to each other about health care or actually posting at each other. Glen, the liberal, just had his argument attacked by David, the conservative. Glen gets mad. One wonders how you can even press the keys on the keyboard. Please just go away. " David responds, "Now I know you're a liberal because liberals are rude and will not listen to any reason. " A guy named Kevin joins in the attack, and he tells Glen to read up on economics and civics. Glen tells Kevin, "Put this in your pipe and smoke it, you pseudo intellectual rube. " From nowhere, a guy named Mark weighs in. He tells Glen that he is "intellectually challenged and advises him that he needs to get some lithium. " When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. Is that what we just heard, our minds closing out there, or is it a great thing that these guys are actually out there engaging with each other at all? Our debate goes in three rounds, then the audience votes to choose the winner. Only one side wins. On the side for our motion, when it comes to politics, the internet is changing our minds, Eli Pariser, a board member and former executive director of MoveOn.org. His partner is Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor and chair of the Department of Media Studies at the University of Virginia. Arguing against the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is changing our minds, Evgeny Morozov, a Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation and author of "The Net Delusion. " And his partner, Jacob Weisberg, chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group. Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds. " Let's meet our debaters now and welcome first Eli Pariser. And Eli, at the age of 20, you joined MoveOn.org to direct its foreign policy campaigns. And then a couple of years later, you became its executive director. You have been an online organizer all of your adult life. But now you are warning about the dangers of the internet. So what changed, you or the internet?

Siva, you are a professor and Department of Media Studies chair at the University of Virginia. You're also author of this book, "The Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry. " This is actually your second debate with us. And the first time you were debating for the motion, "Google violates its don't be evil motto," and you won. Do you still think -- do you still think Google is evil?

You're a visiting fellow at Stanford University, a Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation. You wrote a book also, "The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom. " You have said -- this was in a TED talk, that when the internet reaches a remote Russian village, people are not going to be sitting there watching reports from Human Rights Watch; they're going to be watching pornography, Sex and the City or maybe funny videos of cats.

Now, you wrote for print, for everybody in the old days, the New Republic, New York Magazine, Financial Times among other places. But in 1996, you joined a new online magazine called Slate as its chief political correspondent. That was very early in the game. So what did you know back then?

By the time the debate has ended, we're going to have asked you to vote two times, once before the debate and once again after the debate on the language motion and on your position on it both before and after. And what we want to ask you to do now is go to the key pads at your seat. On the right hand side, you'll see a keypad. And we'll ask you to vote your sentiment on this motion as you're coming off the street. Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds.

Again, at the end of the debate, we're going to ask you to vote on the quality of the arguments that were presented here tonight, and the team that has the greatest differential between this opening vote and the closing vote will be declared by you, our audience, their winners. So we go in three rounds. The first round is seven minutes, each, uninterrupted by each speaker in turn. So on to round one, opening statements from each of our debaters, and going up first for our motion, which is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds," Eli Pariser. He's a MoveOn.org board member, CEO of Upworthy.com, and author of, "The Filter Bubble, What the Internet is Hiding from You. " That book was the inspiration for our having this debate tonight.

I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds with a bit of regret. This isn't the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I've come to believe that the -- well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get together, think together, work together. But it's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is kind of a dated view, that the Internet's changing, and that there are a few big companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of open place. So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable commodity out there right now. If you command attention, then you can direct it towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that's why all of the big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for gathering as much of it as possible. And most of them are focused on the same strategy which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms, we're going to be interested in. Relevance is the big watchword here. So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if you look at what they're saying, it's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan. Eric Schmidt says, "Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not in some way been tailored to you. " Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, "Within the next few years, it'll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn't been customized to your personal interests in some way. " And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how people get their news and how people get their information. So why are they doing this? Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well. Why does Facebook employ filters? The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues. And the thing is that these companies aren't blind to the psychology of all this. They've read all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of pleasure happening in people's brains. And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they believed, they get cranky. That's just the way we're wired. And so if you're a company that's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn't you? As a result of this kind of personalization and self selection, we're more likely to see things we agree with and less likely to see things we disagree with. Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that all personalization is bad. Personalization certainly can have benefits. I'm a Netflix user. But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization? And I'll argue that because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they're building are going to tend to surround us with information that's agreeable to us and not with information that's uncomfortable. So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring. This actually happened, I've got the screenshots on my website. And, you know, I could run through a number of other anecdotes, but actually there's been a study -- the only peer reviewed study I'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front page are usually personalized. Either they're in a different order or they're actually, you know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks you'll be interested in. So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do. And in particular we have to tease apart what's possible to access versus what people do access. For example, now that the -- it's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times. So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy, information, of whats going on in other countries, that people would know more about whats going on there. In fact thats not true. According to a Pew study from 2007, people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than in 2007. So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, its kind of beside the point. Whats relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more particular, different ideological ones. I agree here again with Evgeny who says the regular folk dont read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting blog posts from all over the world. Instead they are more likely to use the internet to rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry. So to summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web. They want to show you what they think youre going to be interested in. And this isn't passive. This isnt me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of the Nation. This is embedded in an increasing number of websites. Yahoo News in 2007, was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same. But now, Yahoo runs 13 million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day. And theyre different for each person. Its hard to even see. We dont know how tailored our view of the web is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences. So the object of this personalization is to get us to click more. Its to get us to like more. And importantly, its to get us to click on ads. And theres little benefit in that world to presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views, or that makes us think differently. I dont think that this has caused the extreme political polarization that were seeing right now. But I think it cant help but exacerbate it. Google says that its trying to provide relevance. But what is the most relevant search result when youre a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11? Is it the conspiracy links that Googles algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article that would debunk that stuff? I asked Google this question and they didnt really have a clear answer. So its with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential. The way that most people actually use the thing isnt to broaden their political perspectives. In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our political views. Thank you.

Jacob is editor in chief of the Slate Group, the internet based arm of the Washington Post Company.

Eli, you cant have Evgeny. Hes committed to me till at least 8:15. Look, Ill concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting theoretical problem. People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already agree with. And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic bubble, where they mostly interact with people who have similar views. But is that a phenomenon thats getting worse? And if it is getting worse, is it getting worse because of the internet? Eli, and I think Siva, is going to argue that because, they think that because Google and Facebook are bad for us, it must be. But their skepticism about these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who think that new technology only brings us good things. There are a lot of interesting theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug, that are just never born out in practice. The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right? Is Google making you stupid? Is Facebook making you lonely? Thats actually the cover this month. Is Twitter destroying your attention span? But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at questions like this in a more empirical way. So whats the evidence for tonights proposition, the internet is narrowing our views. I wont say theres none, but I will say its laughably weak. And theres some really good evidence that the webs doing the opposite of what our opponents claim, that its exposing us to a broader range of perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook. And its on that empirical basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow, that you should vote against tonights motion. Theres of course some studies about this. There was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers dont just talk to their own side. They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and its not all the kind of exchange John cited at the beginning. There's a Pew study from last year that show -- this is a quote, "No evidence that social network users, including those who use Facebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded and similar people as some have feared. " There's another new Pew study that says that people's social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries. The biggest study which involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but it was a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people they aren't close to. That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news. So Eli said at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that "Google was tailoring search results to our politics. " He said that on the basis of one anecdote from a friend I don't think he named. He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt. Allow me to be skeptical. You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the day for a variety of reasons. But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine, different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search some parallel, very political loaded terms like "climate change. " And basically, they got exactly the same thing. And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to support what Eli is talking about. I've looked at the studies. Now, since Eli wrote his book, Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and search returns. So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only people in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideological bias in the returns. But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically addresses Eli's problem. He had a lot of influence on this. You can turn customization off by pressing the prominent button that says, "Hide personal results. " And you can toggle back and forth if you're curious about the difference. On Facebook, it's just as easy to turn off customization. You change the sort option on your top stories to most recent. In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites, is completely transparent and optional. I leave customization on most of the time because a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble. And take music just as an example I think we can all relate to. The reason I use Spotify, which is a social music service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to be exposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends. So back at the level of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political perspective? I think it's much harder to do that than it seems. News organizations are really trying to do that. They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, when you go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page. Of course, you can get narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that. You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV. Now, it is worth noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about. And that was the mainstream media before the internet. When I was a kid in the '70s, you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, local newspapers. There weren't any national ones. And it was a very limited range of viewpoints and voices. And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you have to do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers. So personally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter. I use it as a filter for stories that are relevant to me. And what it does is the opposite of narrowing my perspective. Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources as well as American ones. I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab Spring. I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei the Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the world today. And those filters broaden my perspective. Twitter is a serendipity engine. Finally, I don't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up your mind about tonight's motion. All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple question: Has the web narrowed my mind? Has it made me less tolerant of people I disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say? Or has it exposed me to a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information? Unless you're convinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion.

A reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two fighting it out over this motion, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " We have heard the first opening statements, and now onto the third. Debating for the motion, the author of "The Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry," chair of the University of Virginia's Department of Media Studies. He's been called "Google's gadfly," Siva Vaidhyanathan.

So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I didn't hear a word Jacob said. So in these brief comments, I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked in the resolution and what we mean by politics. And I'm going to convince you to support the resolution. First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity. In 1999, Thomas Friedman wrote these words: "the internet is going to be like a huge vise. It's going to keep tightening and tightening that system --meaning the system of globalization -- "around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller and faster and faster. " Well, Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong. He's been exactly that wrong many times, but never more wrong. Now, in 2012, it's clear that there is no such thing as "The Internet, capital T, capital I as Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s. There is no equalizing force, great democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that matter. In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized, compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized. It's far from global, and it's getting less so every day. The online experience of a person sitting in Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in China. And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in Russia or the United States. And we're talking about more than censorship, although, in many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue. We're also talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments will let people use. The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as well. Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication in an instant, we've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we've seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States. Internet technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want. And the fact is, we're pretty provincial animals. So add the internet to it, we just double down. We get more provincial. Platforms matter, defaults matter, and policies matter. So here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook friends across the globe singing, "We are the world. " There is no coordinated global movement for justice. There's no sophisticated online debate about our collective human state or even our basic human needs. The dominant powers governing our digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the United States are not interested in such matters. They are not interested in us being political. Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China. More often than not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows. Not that there's anything wrong with clicking on virtual cows, but it ain't political. Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated into niches and nations. But all hope is not lost. There is nothing about the nature of the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political. Many of us actually are, I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of avoiding these traps. We're pretty elite. We're pretty aware. And we're pretty connected. And we route around a lot of these problems. We're also hungry for information. If you weren't hungry, you wouldn't be here. So many of us, despite what Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have managed to be richly political. But we do know that the internet by itself does not topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers. It's just not that simple. If we recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive. We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend cosmopolitan perspectives. We just haven't done that yet. We've been really busy clicking on cows. But all that takes work. It takes real human work in addition to invention and imagination, real human effort. But the first step to recognizing that -- I'm sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what's happening. When it comes to politics, the Internet, most importantly how we experience the Internet is closing our minds one cow click at a time. Please vote for the motion. Thanks.

Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the Internet is closing our minds. " And our final debater against the motion, he comes from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus, something that has shaped his interest in the Internet's role in politics, he is a Schwartz Fellow at the New American Foundation, and author of the book, "The Net Delusion," Evgeny Morozov.

Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history. First, technology always plays the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind. Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," in the '80s? Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones. And he actually argued that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents. We know what the late Allan Bloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried by the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me. The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as the . As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew Shapiro, which argued, and I quote, "Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia than cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and with information tailored to your desires. " That was 1995. Six years later, Cass Sunstein argued that, "The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views," end of quote. So enter Eli Pariser. In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiro and Sunstein. All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is taking place. But they're also different. Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way out and simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters and algorithms are doing this for us. It's a very important difference. Shapiro and Sunstein blame the filter bubble on us, the users. But Pariser blames it on the companies. Now, who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory? After all, it's always good to find someone else to blame but us. I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that Jacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters naturally enhance our political culture. So let's take Twitter. Many people think that Twitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering. That is actually not true. Twitter does hide certain types of messages. Thus, if you follow me but you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet. Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my messages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva. And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf. Is it paternalistic? Sure. Are these types of paternalism justified? Well, take my case. I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get. But if I have to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of people that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000 people. At best, I would follow 100. This is the beauty of it, Twitter's filter allows me to access more, not less useful information. Now, let's take Facebook. It has 800 million users. Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends and spend hours on it every day. Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen friends. So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation. If you are a heavy user, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order. Thats the most recent updates from all your friends come first. However, if you only use it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates. The assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30 minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order? To Facebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption. Thats why relevance rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users. If you want to see all the recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called most recent. Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is good or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, we should also accept that filters make it better. Now lets tackle the elephant in the room, which is Google. Suppose Im so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is larger than Glenn Becks. So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job. I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim, that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that the government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on. In other words, Im exactly the kind of guy that Eli is worried about. Furthermore, suppose that I became all of that before the filter bubble set in. In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to call the era of cable television. So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts personalizing my search results. Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11, actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends. In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well. Now this is the new mutual exposure, why is it a good thing? Well if you think that all my friends are nut cases like me, then we do have a problem, because exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid. But lets leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment. I dont think theyre representative of most internet users and their friends. The way Google and Facebook map out our social connections, they try to be very comprehensive. We see links from people we went to school with, our colleagues, our relatives, and so forth. Its quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11, climate change, Obamas birthplace, and UFOs. So my point is this, that a link to the report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, is more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social filter. In other words, its a possibility that people would now be paying more attention or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial, only because their friends are known to endorse those positions. So, to conclude, there are many good concerns about the future of the Internet. That of privacy ranks very high on my personal list, but the filter bubble is not one of them. Its okay to hate Google and Facebook, but we should hate them for the right reasons. Thank you.

And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US debate, where the motion being argued is, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because were going to ask you to vote again at the end and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. Now we go on to round two. Round two is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me. We have two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " The side arguing for the motion, Eli Pariser and Siva Vaidhyanathan. Theyre arguing that the internet is actually several internets, that they put up walls between the lands that are occupied by people of differing opinions, between nations as much as between liberals and conservatives. And that especially with customization, designed to give us what we want, that the internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded. The team arguing against the motion, Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov, theyre saying sure, maybe these bad things could happen someday but theres not much evidence that they are happening a lot yet right now. And besides a tool that can and does connect strangers globally around the world by definition, almost, is a good thing.

So I want to put a question to the side that is arguing against the motion, that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. Jacob Weisberg, you said as your sort of slam dunk point to the audience, you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing your mind. But if the other guys are right, they wont know whether the audience is closing their minds because if their minds are being closed, part of having their minds closed is not knowing that their minds are being closed. I mean, but they're saying that it's an insidious thing, that it's a stealth thing, particularly with the customization, that it happens in a way that it comes to you -- you go through this process unawares. Can you take that on?

We're sophisticated. It's a bit -- it's a problem for the hoi polloi out there, the unwashed masses who, you know, are just getting spoon fed whatever they get fed. I find that argument condescending. I mean, we live in a democracy, and it seems to me that we're all responsible for the information we receive. And not everybody engages as deeply in different subjects. But the difference with the internet is we can measure it.

There is one -- first off, the reason that it's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get inside the black box of these companies. And these companies don't have any interest in letting people go in and prove that these companies are doing bad things. But it's very hard to look at from the outside, which is why there's just not many studies that haven't been, as Jacob said, you know, funded by Facebook, funded by Microsoft, funded by the companies themselves. The one clear study on Google personalization that has been peer reviewed is a study by a guy named Martin Feuz. And it's pretty clear. The methodology is good. He looked at how a search history affects the personalization you get. And it's very clear, again, 60 percent of the search results on the first page are different for most -- for people who have a long web history in Google. But actually, the study that's the most interesting here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to. This is a study that was sort of initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that the internet isn't as polarizing as we thought. And the interesting thing is that if you dig into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite. What they did was they created an isolation index for each different kind of medium. And so the isolation index for cable news that that study used was about 3.3. On the internet, the internet had a 7 -- an isolation index of 7. And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news. Now, what's more interesting is that this was -- the study was done before the personalized internet. So the main thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving patterns lead them to Yahoo! and then from Yahoo! out to a whole bunch of ideologically diverse links. But Yahoo! 's changed since 2007, since that study was written. And so now, Yahoo! looks at your history on what links you've clicked at in the past and sends different people out in different directions.

Now, that 30 has become embedded in every experience that we have on the internet now. So you know, I think actually if you look into the studies that have been done --

But I think you also have to keep in mind that a lot depends on what kind of information you're trying to access online. If you're searching for a piece on Manhattan and I'm searching it from my mobile phone, then Google knows where I am, I would actually want 99 percent of the searches also to be personalized, probably not 60. Sixty is not high enough, in part because it's very obvious that what I want to do is to order a pizza. Right? So then if I am searching for political information, right, maybe the ratio should be 10 percent or 5 percent or zero. So to say that there is 60 percent of information that's personalized doesn't say much because it all depends on what it is that's being personalized. Another point is that, again, take something like YouTube. So if you don't sign in to YouTube, YouTube will show you at the very front page videos that are most popular with the rest of the crowd. You see all those fascinating cat videos. You will see all those videos from MTV. You will see whatever is now popular in the online world. They will all be displayed to you, and you will see them there prominently. If I sign in with my Google account, with my search history, instead of cat videos, I'll see links to new exciting videos about history, about culture, about theater. Why? Because Google and YouTube know that those are the kind of videos that I like to watch. So if Google can show me more videos about history than videos about cats, I can't really see how the internet is closing our minds.

That's kind of a nonsensical argument. As everyone has said, filtering has been around as long as there's information to filter. But the question is, what are the filters -- what are the lenses through which we're looking at the world now doing for most people who are looking at the world through those lenses? And I think we're talking a lot here about Twitter, but it's important to remember that Twitter -- actually it's hard to remember in a group of New Yorkers -- Twitter is a fringe phenomenon on the Internet relative to Google or Facebook. Twitter has a tiny, tiny user base compared to these other -- sorry?

Do you want to say that Google and Facebook aren't allowed to filter in certain ways, or do you want them to become this sort of paternalistic gatekeepers that say, "If you're searching for Lady Gaga video, you also have to have a little bit of this interesting study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

I'm suggesting that, if we built these tools toward the purpose of helping people get good information, including a diversity of perspective, we could do that in a way that would draw on the Internet strength. So I'll give you one example, Facebook, the main way that you propagate information across Facebook is with the Like button. The Like button has a very particular valence. It's easy to click Like on, "I baked a cake," it's hard to click Like on, "Massacre in Darfur continues for 11th year. " And so certain kinds of information propagate very readily. Other kinds of information don't propagate at all. Now, without instituting any kind of objective paternalism, this is more important than that, you could put an Important button on Facebook that'll allow people to elevate the topics that they believed were important as well as the topics that they think are fun and interesting and that they'd like their friends to see.

Again, you have to understand that this is a very particular context in which I think warning people about certain types of websites, which has nothing to do with socialization, has everything to do with certain publishers publishing deliberately misleading information about vaccination, for example, or about the risks of flu vaccines or any other sort of vaccine, and I think it would not be a bad idea for Google to show that there are sites which have actually been approved through peer review and through normal scientific practice and -- to show that, "Hey, you actually have sites which you can trust. " I don't think it has much to do with filtering or the social layer.

I don't think we should be in the business of telling Google what to do or telling Facebook what to do.

And having these conversations, I think everybody should read books about the subject, which is a pretty good way. And then adjust your own behavior and have those ideas echo through your social networks, that perhaps its a good idea to break out of the filter bubble.

For some concrete examples of this phenomenon that concerns you, actually having caused harm to the body politic, because theres a little bit of an assumption, and maybe youre not making this point, but theres a little bit of this assumption that all do need to be talking to each other and that theres a middle that well all reach in some kumbaya moment. But in fact, whats wrong with having people entrenched in their own camps, angry at each other? As long as the political spectrum is covered overall, whats wrong with that? And what examples of harm can you talk about that have been caused by that.

And the host decided to make this big spectacle of having people Google Barack Obama and call-in and read their search results. It was a really boring radio hour. And the first person called in, the second person called in and they interviewed everybody and had people kind of do a read-off where theyre both reading it off at the same time and it was exactly the same. And I was thinking, this is the worse book promotion Ive ever done. And then a third guy called in, and he said you know its the damndest thing, when I Google Barack Obama, the first thing that comes up is this link to this site about how hes not a natural citizen. And the second link is also a link to a website about how he doesnt have a birth certificate.

I mean as I say, Ive tried to test this out as best I can. Ive tried it myself on various browsers, signed in, signed out, Wikipedia always comes up first, sometimes it comes up second. Wikipedias vaccine entry is pretty good. I do not think there is actually the kind of variety youre talking in searches done most of the time by most people.

Right so almost any, even if you did a broader study than that, even if Eli did a broader study than that, the third person to do that study would not come up with the same results. For the simple reason that both Facebook and Google are constantly changing their algorithms, constantly tweaking their algorithms for reasons we cant possibly understand and are not allowed to understand. Its also important to remember that there are so many variables in what you get. There are some searches that are more personalized than other searches. Again, for reasons that Google understands and we are not allowed to understand. There are some ways that you can generate different searches because there are certain keywords that matter more in certain geographic locations than others. So a search for S-O-X in Boston or Chicago will yield a particularly strong result and personalized in those areas where as S-O-X searched somewhere else in the world might yield gibberish because it doesnt mean anything. So all of these variables, plus the big variable, whether or not youre a Gmail user, whether or not youre signed into YouTube, whether or not --

You can state a quick premise, but please ask a question that keeps us on the topic of this motion, and we'll move along this debate. And I really do mean it to be a question, not a -- not a debating point. But we -- we did put out, on slate.com, who is our media partner, a request to them for questions from some of their subscribers. And we also -- is Lenny Gengrinovich here? Did you show up? Yep, there he is. All right. So Lenny took the initiative of sending a question into us by email. So thank you for that. And I'm going to actually -- you can ask the question yourself. I just wanted you to actually make it drastically shorter.

And when there is a suboptimal result, we have to know how to correct for it. And if we're not happy with it, to invent something new.

We've been very concerned about -- at Slate over the years with improving it. The big breakthrough, I have to say, came from Facebook, through a technology -- an interface known as Facebook connect, which basically brought identity- based commenting to every website. And it means that because people are themselves when they comment, they're actually a lot more reasonable, not necessarily reasonable all the time, but they don't engage in quite the level of viciousness and ad homonym attacks and just soft point arguing they do when they're anonymous. So I think partly this say problem I'm optimistic about improving through technology.

And one of the fascinating things about this book is that you have two things going on at the same time. On the one hand, there is a broader set of types of communities than there was 30 years ago, right? That's undoubtedly true. On the other hand, for each individual person in that system, their neighborhood is more like people like them than it ever was in the past. And so you have local homogeneity and heterogeneity at the top level. And I think when people are trying to make the opposite argument, they point to, hey, look at the internet, there's all this different stuff out there. It's so heterogeneous. Everybody's talking. But actually, the question is, what are people's local neighborhoods like? And to the extent that we're now bringing those local neighborhoods with us online, what effect does that have in, you know, amplifying the homogeneity that increasingly surrounds us even when we're off line.

No. I felt personally just the opposite. I feel like I've never been in touch with a wider variety of viewpoints and people. And a lot of that is through social media, because people act as filters for you. When you find something that's somewhat interesting, whether they're a personal friend, whether they are someone in a field you're interested in, whether they're in another field or just someone you admire, they bring you a whole range of things, on Twitter, on Facebook. So no, my experience has been just the opposite.

And it is amazingly hard to do. And, you know, I think it's probably always been hard. I don't think that, that's a new phenomenon, but the degree to which people live in different universes of fact, not just different universes of opinion, in other words, the degree to which you can't even get to something to argue about because people won't even agree that, that's a thing, is, you know, really striking. And I can't help but wonder as Evgeny has, as have many of us, if the way that the Internet is structured isn't amplifying that and helping people who believe, you know, pretty in my opinion, you know, misinformation, like the Obama birth certificate stuff or that climate change is not something that's partly caused by people, is it amplified by that.

That's happening, and I deplore it. I just don't think the Internet has anything to do with it. I think the big drivers of that are redistricting which put people in districts that tend to go one way or the other and fewer that swing back and forth. I think it's fundraising which means politicians spend all their time fundraising and actually don't have human relationships with each other very much. I think hyper partisan media, of which Fox is probably the best example, have some impact on it. But members of Congress, these are -- if you want to look for a group of people who really aren't on the Internet very much, that's them. I mean, I don't think it's what's driving it.

That's the currency. And indignation is a subset of the attention economy. In order to appear on CNN at 2:00 in the afternoon, in order to appear on Fox News at 7:00 p.m., you have to say something that angers somebody, either directly in their face, "I'm angering you as someone who disagrees with me," or more likely you gather people on your side to be angry. And the notion that we are so addicted to something now we can measure, the click, the instant attention, the instant affirmation, just reinforces that, so it is a phenomenon that's actually moved from the blogosphere, and that's why we've seen so many people who got famous being bloggers now are appearing on CNN at 2 PM, now appearing on Fox at 7 PM. Right, thats whats happening. Its why MSNBC is filled with former bloggers. It is because theyre already adept at generating indignation towards one side or another.

The question is, is the way that most people use the internet helping or hurting? Thats the question that you really have to answer. Is the way that people are using the internet helping or hurting in this? And I think, its hard to argue, most peoples social networks are homogenous, thats just true. Most people do have social networks that are largely made up of people like them. Now there are the outliers for sure. But if youre getting more from people who you know, youre getting more of your news from people who are like you.

This is -- I really dont know the answer, which is, do you think now, or before the internet, it was harder to avoid, whatever your ideology, information that would challenge your belief, be it the nightly news or an encyclopedia or the newspaper, whereas now, you mentioned Wikipedia. But that might be, there might be an analogue to the encyclopedia of old, but now you could just go to Conservapedia and find out that wow, Paul Revere actually, the ride was consistent with what it was described as. And so its a lot easier to find that information thats going to confirm your biases and that would contribute to the closing of the mind.

But the other side is arguing that without our knowing it now, the internet is making us do that and were unaware of it. So do you feel that your question was answered?

And I think we all agree that in a democracy, you need an informational common to some extent, where people are arguing about what they think about reality, not about reality itself. But I think Wikipedias a pretty great information commons. And it is again, the first search return on almost everything, or at least one of the first few. And Wikipedia has its issues and its problems but overall, Wikipedia strives to be neutral ground on an informational level. Thats an anecdote, but I think its an important one. I think the internet cuts both ways and in some ways, it can cut in favor of confirmation biases that youre talking about, and in some ways it can cut right against it.

One of the findings of the Pew study was that the more personalized Google search results, the further down Wikipedia was in the search results. So if you have an empty search history, Wikipedia is the top result. But the larger your search history, the less Wikipedia comes up. The more its replaced by -- so this was the best study that we have on Google personalization. And it suggests, I agree --

Google doesnt care what you click on; all they care is you stay on Google. Right? They dont really care whether you go to Wikipedia or Conservapedia or somewhere else. Right, and I think right now what Google actually wants to do is present the result right away without having to spend any time on it. So, yeah, I just don't see the logic on which you're basing that decision. But the response to the question you asked, I think you need -- we need to set realistic goals for ourselves. We are not going to dissuade people who deliberately decide to go to Conservapedia instead of Wikipedia. There is nothing policy-wide that we can do. If people already decided to seek those very biased views. There is little we can do. I think we need not be Utopian. We have to set realistic policy goals. And from a public policy perspective, to figure out what we can do, change design, regulate Google, ask them to do something. But to expect that Google suddenly can wave the magic wand and make sure that people stop going to FOX News.com or Conservapedia and start going to Wikipedia instead, I think it's an unrealistic goal that we shouldn't even set for ourselves.

My name is John. So I don't really hear anyone saying that information moving quickly and lots of information is closing our minds. I hear not the internet but internet companies or even personalization is closing our minds. So my question for the team arguing for the motion is, would something that wasn't corporate, like a public search engine alternative to Google that's nonprofit and not commercial solve some of the problems? And then my question for the against the motion team would be, would you be opposed to something like that as a policy decision because you love personalization so much?

That's a nice idea, and I think it's worth pursuing and experimenting. I'm not willing to predict the results. I think the important thing is that we try everything. The important thing is that we let a few things fail, and we try to learn from our mistakes. But we do so openly. We do so deliberately. And we don't sign away so many important things to a black box.

And nobody would use it. If it didn't know where you were, if it didn't gather any information about what kinds of things you were interested in. I do think --

And suppose you don't know. It's an article about a theory known as cute cat theory, which is basically they applied it to the Arab Spring and saying that all of these movements, people that might want to watch cute cat videos, that's the majority of the people on the internet. That's what they use it for. There is a small majority who use it for internet activism. Now, a site like YouTube that uses the majority of people want to watch cute cat videos, but it also posts things like -- like --

So for those of you arguing against the motion, I would be interested to hear your thoughts.

And for a while, it wasn't so hard. First of all, YouTube comes over really slowly in the people's republic because its servers are hosted in North America. Google knows not to put the servers in China. That would be bad news. During the Tibetan uprising three years ago, YouTube basically went dark. During the Olympics, it went dark. And it's been intermittent since. And nobody has banged on the doors of the Chinese government saying, "I want my YouTube. " They're busy with their own video services. They're busy with their own business. They're busy clicking on their own issues, right? So it doesn't necessarily follow in that example. The other thing to remember, when talking about the Arab Spring, going to a different part of the world, is that only 30 percent of the Egyptian population was online at the time. And then 11 days into the protest, zero percent were. SMS was a much more important media form for doing anything. And Al Jazeera was probably the most important media forum for informing people. So what happened in North Africa had very little to do with cats, cute or otherwise.

But I'm asking those who are for the motion, what about people who go and seek out information in terms of wanting to comment on articles and videos that are against their own beliefs?

There's a great cartoon that someone's staying up late at night and person tries to get them to come to bed, and they say, but someone on the internet is wrong. That's like the experience that a lot of us have a lot of the time, but the question is whether the daily routines that we move through online will tend to bring us into contact more with people who make us feel that way or more with people who actually validate who we feel. And as social networking becomes a bigger phenomenon, and I think in specific Facebook, lets separate Facebook from Twitter, it's easier than ever to surround yourself with people who mostly agree with you, that's who your friends are. Now, just to address Twitter in particular, like I agree with these guys that Twitter is like a pretty good medium for filtering the Internet and I use it to -- I follow Karl Rove on Twitter and I get Karl Rove's tweets and it's great. And, you know, I also follow him on Facebook, and I never see his Facebook posts because Facebook actually does a lot more personalization than Twitter does. Now, you know --

" I mean, just to go back to the numbers a minute, Twitter claims either, their numbers, 200 -- more than 200 million registered users, more than 100 million active users. Facebook claims 800 million registered users, 400 million active users. I actually think Facebook's definition of an active user is much more generous to itself than Twitter, so maybe it is four times users, but, I mean, it's not insignificant.

There is no personalization. If you use it not seven hours a day but just one day a month, then -there is personalization. And then there is no justification for you to see every single Karl Rove message because you only have 30 minutes and you have 5,000 friends and you have one hour a month to spend on it. There is no way for you to do it except for personalization.

And you'll be asked once again to vote and to pick the winner in just a few minutes. On to round three, closing statements from each debater in turn. Our motion is, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " And here to summarize his position against the motion, Jacob Weisberg, chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group.
When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds|i2Debates/internet-politics.p|265|R4|JACOB WEISBERG|against|2|16|10|0|0|21|0|51|2|1|6|2|85|31|0|14|21|0|1|3|0|232|7|0|1|0|0|0|21|0|0|13|31|0|0|4|12|0|0|1|11|5|7|26|41|40|68|7|29|0|0|3|0|0|34|17|0|16|1|8|66|7|3|14|12|364|I did like one suggestion Eli made which is that there should be buttons other than like on Facebook. There should be a, "I'm not buying it," button, and I would have been clicking that the whole time I was hearing this argument. The Internet doesn't change human nature, it just creates new opportunities for us. And if your view of human nature is that people are naturally inclined to be ignorant and bigoted and extreme, you're going to focus on the way the web lets them become even narrower and more close minded. But if that's your view of things, your problem isn't with the web, it's with democracy, because people like that aren't going to do a very good job of governing themselves. If on the other hand you think people are capable of informing and governing themselves, you have to appreciate the way that the web, which is the greatest trove of open information that the world has ever known, empowers us and broadens our political perspective. Evgeny and I have talked about some of those ways tonight, and I think Siva and Eli have talked about a theoretical problem that just hasn't been supported by the evidence or borne out. Does anyone here actually think that our political system would be better off without the web's democratization of information and the multiplicity of voices, if Tim Berners-Lee had never invented the world wide web, do you think we'd be better off if the web or Google or Facebook and Twitter or blogs were somehow magically taken away or regulated in some paternalistic way? And I want to ask you again to think about your personal experience because it may not be an academic study but collectively it's meaningful. Do you think the internet is making you more narrow or is it exposing you to ideas, people, and arguments, and points of view that you wouldnt have access to without it? In closing I just want to say that the idea that you and I would be less narrow in our politics without the web, isnt just wrong, its actually preposterous. And thats why you have to vote against tonights motion.

Our motion is "When it comes to politics the internet is closing our minds" and here to summarize his position for the motion, Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org, board member and author of the Filter Bubble.
When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds|i2Debates/internet-politics.p|267|R4|ELI PARISER|for|3|9|6|0|0|19|1|37|0|0|6|3|68|22|0|10|6|0|0|0|0|232|8|0|1|0|0|4|29|0|0|9|39|0|1|3|3|0|0|3|12|1|6|32|55|31|76|11|28|0|0|0|0|0|37|18|0|4|9|4|57|9|6|5|18|382|So I want to read you a quote from two Stanford researchers from 1997. They said, "We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. We believe that the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that its crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. " Now, the two researchers were Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and this was just months before they launched Google as a for-profit entity. I think that version of them was right. I think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put information online have mixed motives. And the motives that they use in creating these filters may not be, and in fact arent in our best interests. Theyre more likely to surround us with voices that tell us that were great and were right and were good enough and strong enough. And theyre less likely to confront us with the places where were wrong. Whats been interesting for me since writing the book is that Ive actually been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies, Amazon, Apple, Google, YouTube, and Facebook. Ive had conversations with people in each of those places. And its sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isnt a big part of what these companies are trying to do. The engineers know that it is. They wrestle with it every day. They wrestle with the mixed motives, with these questions of how they should be building these platforms. And they know as one Netflix vice president told me, that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles where they tend to believe the same thing. So if you believe that the companies whose algorithms decide what we pay attention to, will tend to expose us to a broad diverse set of sources, you should vote with them. But if you agree with me that we should scrutinize that, and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view, then you should vote that the internet has in fact, unfortunately, been closing our minds.

This is our motion. "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " And here to summarize his position against the motion, Evgeny Morozov, author of The Net Delusion, visiting scholar at Stanford and Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation.
When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds|i2Debates/internet-politics.p|269|R4|EVGENY MOROZOV|against|0|23|8|0|0|15|0|41|0|0|3|1|78|16|0|10|12|0|0|3|0|202|8|0|0|0|0|0|18|0|0|15|24|0|0|1|5|0|0|1|4|0|5|23|44|42|49|8|22|0|0|0|0|4|23|14|0|7|0|9|58|12|4|5|24|353|Well I wish that Don Draper had a chance to respond to that 1997 paper from Google. Again, you may think that advertising is evil, but again, advertising is the kind of evil thats also inevitable. So Eli has mostly avoided the whats to be done question. In his book, he actually is much more I think straightforward. And he does want Google and Facebook to intervene and to expose us to more diverse information. More diverse information diet even, that you are normally up for. This second attempt is an utopian dream that is not realizable in practice. Do we really want Facebook and Google to start nudging us to pay more attention to Joseph Kony in Uganda when we are searching for information about our local city council? Okay, but then why pay more attention to Joseph Kony and say not climate change, or Syria? Who will adjudicate here? Do we really think that Silicon Valley is capable of this? Do we really think Silicon Valley should be in this business? Again, you have to think about the proposed solution. Often theyre worse than the cure. Dont forget, that in 1995, in that article in The Nation, Andrew Shapiro proposed that the government should re-nationalize the internet, to bring it back to avoid all that advertising evil that youve just alluded to. Cass Sunstein in his book, wanted to force, by government, bloggers to link to their ideological opponents. He wanted them, conservatives to link to liberals, and liberals to link to conservatives. All of those ideas now seem very ridiculous. And thats what I think we will think about the idea that Google and Facebook should be in the business of actually preserving us and presenting us with a more diverse information diet. Information is not like food. Politics is not like food. Diversity here is a very political matter that will not be settled very easily. Ideological conflict here is inevitable and I think this is why you should vote against this proposition. The sooner we do it, the sooner we can start attacking more important threats like privacy.

Jacob said, what if we had a world without the web? What if we had the world without the web? We might get there. Let me tell you why, because Facebook and Google and Microsoft and Apple all wish to be the operating systems of our lives. They're explicit about this. They don't just want to be on the web because the web is 20 years old, and it's actually kind of creaky. What they want to do is be there with you all the time in your glasses, in your pocket, in your purse and on your mind always. They want to be your personal assistant. There's quote after quote after quote from every CEO of every one of these companies that that's what they want. And it might make things really cool for us. But it's not going to make things rich and diverse. It's not going to be the wonderful conversation that we could have had on the web if we hadn't instigated these gated communities, these operating systems of our lives. We're on the way to having a Balkanized world and a Balkanized society because of these gated communities. The fact is, nothing is determined here. We can decide that we like what the web was supposed to be. We can opt out of certain of these practices. We should encourage diversity, encourage other platforms. We should encourage experimentation. We should recognize that Facebook and Google and Yahoo! and Bing and Apple and Microsoft are designed to gratify us immediately. And that's great for pizza, but it's not for politics. Thank you very much. Please vote for the resolution.

And that concludes our closing statements. And now it is time to learn which side you believe has argued best. We're going to ask you again to go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote on which side you feel presented the stronger argument tonight. And we will get the readout pretty much immediately. Press one if you support the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. Press number two if you are against this motion. And press number three if you remain or became undecided. And you can correct your vote if you think you pressed the wrong button, and it will be locked in right away. And we'll have the results in about 90 seconds.

It was witty, and it was informative, and it went places. Thank you very much to them. Thank you also to everyone in the audience who had the guts to stand up and ask a question and to all the people who I didn't get to answer -- to ask questions, I wasn't able to allow to ask questions, thank you, very much for your contribution to those as well. So going forward, I just want to let you know that our next debate is in May. It's our last debate of the season. And our motion comes down to three words, "Ban college football. " And we had actually set this debate up quite a while back. It has -- it was not in relation to the Penn State scandal. It was actually motivated more by reporting that was done about the business side of college football and the sometimes harsh nature of the sport on the bodies of the athletes who play it. So our debaters will include somebody who wrote one of those articles, Malcolm Gladwell, who is author of "The Tipping Point," and "Blink," and he will be on the panel arguing for the motion. And he wrote the piece in the New Yorker in which he compares college football to dog fighting. His partner will be Buzz Bissinger. He is the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author of Friday Night Lights. That served as the inspiration for a movie of the same name and a critically acclaimed television series also of the same name. Opposing them, we have a football player, Tim Green. He is the former Atlanta falcons NFL defensive end, and Syracuse University all American. He was inducted into the college football hall of fame in 2002. And his partner also debating against the motion, Jason Whitlock. He is Foxsports.coms national columnist, and he's already as an offensive tackle at Ball State University. So that's our last debate. That's on May 17th. And we would love to see you there. Also we're trying something new tonight after the debate. Any of you want to join us, we are partnering with the New American Tavern to host a post debate reception that will be upstairs at Amity Hall. That's a block away from here on Third Street between Thompson and Sullivan. Details are in the programs that you have. But our idea was that we noticed a lot of times people walk out of here still kind of energized and revisiting the issues and debating among yourselves. We wanted to give you a place to do it and get together. And to share your ideas across the partisan divide. So that'll be at Amity Hall, $5 beer and well drinks. And I will be there for a bit as well along with other members of the Intelligence Squared staff. And finally, you are encouraged to Tweet about this debate. Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US. And the hash tag is IQ2US. So we'll just wait about -- it's ready already. Thank you. All right. So the results are all in. Our motion is this: "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds. " You have heard the arguments for and against over the course of this debate. We ask you to vote before and again afterwards where you stand on this and how persuasive the teams were. Here are the results. Before the debate, 28 percent voted for the motion. 37 percent against and 35 percent were undecided. After the debate, 53 percent are for the motion. That is up 25 percent. 36 percent are against it. That is down 1 percent. We have 11 percent undecided. The motion, when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds has carried. Our congratulations to that team. Thank you for me, John Donvan and Intelligence Squared

Well, "Men are finished," mmm. I for one hope not. But there does seem to be a lot of evidence that we are. Traditional male attributes like competitiveness, aggression and risk taking are discouraged in -- in classrooms and derided in popular culture. As a society, our values seem to be shifting toward the traditional feminine virtues of empathy, cooperation, emotional intelligence. Increasingly, men are not taking the responsibility for parenting, and women are proceeding on their own. At the top of the cognitive pyramid, women are now a majority in our universities, graduate schools of law, business and medicine. And at the bottom, the high-paid jobs men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in factories have fallen victim to globalization. Men are overrepresented in prisons and in the ranks of the unemployed. And underrepresented in higher education. Project these trends forward for a couple of decade, and the future looks pretty bleak for men. On the other hand, and there always is another hand in our debates, men still hold positions of overwhelming dominance as CEOs of our largest companies and financial institutions, as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes, the Microsofts, Oracles, Googles, Facebooks, as top elected officials in both the federal and state governments, as the most influential artists and writers, as scientists with breakthroughs worthy of Nobel prizes and on and on. So where do you come out tonight on this question, are men finished? The answer may depend on how you interpret the question. What we meant but couldn't say in three provocative words, is whether we're at a tipping point where women are likely to achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past, or whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant, perhaps, but hardly fundamental. Well, we have an extraordinary group of panelists to help you make that decision, and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them, and to our moderator, John Donvan.

And when I say their names, I'd appreciate it if you could applaud for their names. But first I'd like to ask for one more round of applause for Mr. Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible. True or false, men are finished? That's what we are here to debate, another verbal matchup from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. Men are finished. Two teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it. These teams include Dan Abrams, my colleague at ABC News, where he is chief legal analyst and author of "Man Down," which gives proof that women are unequivocally better than men. His debating partner is Hanna Rosin. She is a senior editor at the Atlantic and founding editor of XX, a woman-focused section of the online magazine, Slate. Nothing like a packed house. Opposing them at the facing table, Christina Hoff Sommers. She is a philosophy professor and author of Who Stole Feminism? and The War Against Boys. Her partner, David Zinczenko, executive vice president and editor in chief of Men's Health magazine. Now, this is the debate. It is a contest. One team will win, and one team will lose in this joust of ideas. And you, our live audience here at the Skirball Center will be functioning as our judges. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards to register where you stand on this motion, "Men are finished. " And the team that has changed the most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner.
Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|5|R2|JOHN DONVAN|moderator|4|6|4|0|0|20|1|21|0|0|2|0|28|8|0|2|3|0|2|1|0|141|4|0|0|0|2|4|9|0|1|2|8|0|0|5|0|1|0|4|5|2|2|27|27|18|36|3|30|0|1|0|0|3|30|15|0|4|1|8|30|5|0|11|17|226|So let's go to your preliminary vote. If you go to these key pads at your seat, they have numbers one through three along the top row. If you agree with the motion, "Men are finished," push number one. If you disagree, push number two. And if you are undecided, push number three. And if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. And what we're going to do is tabulate those. And at the end of the debate after the second vote, I'll present both numbers. And reminding you again the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. So our motion is, "Men are finished. " And now onto round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. They will be seven minutes each. And I'd like to introduce first for the motion, Hanna Rosin. She is an award-winning journalist for Slate and the Atlantic. Her 2010 cover story, which was titled, "The End of Men," provoked a fire storm of responses. She is now writing a book expanding on her theory that men are losing their dominance. And as a matter of fact, she went to high school, Stuyvesant, a few blocks away from here where I understand you were a debater?

I'd even like to welcome the men to the debate tonight although of course I pity you. Just kidding. Before I dive in, I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition. What do we mean by men are finished? We'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an inevitable future. What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have to prove that there are no male geniuses, that there's no more male CEOs, that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a while as sex slaves. That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard. Maybe it sounds good to you guys. But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to. We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically. I'll start with the fundamentals. In 2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force. This is kind of an amazing fact. As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of you might remember. Now she is the majority of the work force. If you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools. And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American managers. Now, how are men doing these days? They're doing very, very badly. The annual income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going. Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever existed. When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of those things. What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences. Now, why is this happening? The very simple answer is college. Most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple. It's just a college degree. But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees than men. For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. So why are women getting more college degrees? It's not that women are smarter because they're not smarter. These days, men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and English. But women have something. Some sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social intelligence. It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men. And this is a very new thing. Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college. But then they're going to say so what? Women are goody goodies, then they go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else. But this is, of course, completely preposterous. For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you already see the results in the economy. You already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30. And that's really, really new. Also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something that's brand new. And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later. So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture. We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack. And so we see him in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials. He's sitting around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college. I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season. The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames. One of the guys in the sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot. So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days. Now we're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity. Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets. Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health. Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression. The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's adventurous free loving spirit. These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity. Men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes. If you look at the back at the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man. These days the men are waxing and primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner. Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology industry. I have a few things to say to that. First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school. It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished. You're also likely to hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top. I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside- down overnight. But the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why you should vote for us.

"Men are finished" is our motion and now here to speak against the motion I'd like to introduce Christina Hoff Sommers. She's a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is a critic of radical feminism and the author of The War Against Boys and also Who Stole Feminism? Does the answer to that question figure in to the argument you're going to make here tonight?

Yes, yes, indeed, women are joining men as partners in running the world but they're not replacing them. Women are flourishing in ways which are unprecedented, exciting, glorious. But men have hardly vanished from the limelight. I mean, after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns, men are still more likely than women to run for political office, start businesses, file patents, write editorials, tell jokes. They conduct the orchestras. They direct the great movies. They blow up things. Now, I admit blowing up things is problematic. I wish they would do less of it. Men commit most acts of wanton violence. But, at the same time, it usually takes other men to stop them. The males are in decline crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building women, happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy. They point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators, more social workers, veterinarians, dance therapists, teachers. The problem is that you cant sustain a network of nurturers and communicators without someone paying for it. Youre still going to need ambitious, hard-driven innovators, manufacturers, engineers, construction workers, along with police officers, firefighters and the military. Now, were told that toughness and assertiveness, those are obsolete, fit for another age, not the 21st century. Thats absurd. Its worse than absurd. It borders on being ungrateful and even elitist. It ignores the actions and virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and debate whether men are in decline. It reminds me of a quote by -- well, attributed to George Orwell. Orwell allegedly said, We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf. Well, the world is still dangerous, and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some women who are willing to fight and die to protect us. Now, Hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid, but she says, quote, Mens hold on power in elite circles is loosening. Loosening? Yes, of course. I agree. And I welcome it. But its not evidence of a female takeover. I mean, just think about it. Women have amazing talents. They can be as dazzling as men when they set their minds to it. But the sexes are equal. But they exercise their equality in different ways. Consider science and technology. Women now hold a majority of college degrees, and they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, biology. Its quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these fields and, indeed, very exciting to behold. Theyre just as competitive as men in those fields, if not more. But those numbers dont hold in other fields. Math, technology, engineering -- those are fields where men prevail by huge numbers. And give them time, says Hanna. Women have only just begun, and that women are in ascendancy. Theyre going to gain momentum. Where is it? I see no sign of it. According to a recent study by the Commerce Department, womens numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10 years. I mean, if Hanna were right, these trends -- we would begin to see women taking over, or at least showing some progress. We see no progress, very little progress in those fields. Now, ask yourself, is technology finished? Is engineering finished? Is the military finished? Are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a roofer, a logger -- are those finished? Now, its true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble. And I agree very much with Hanna that this is a matter of grave concern. Girls do better than boys in school. They get better grades. They score higher on reading and writing tests. Theyre more likely to go to college. The reason for girls educational success, theyre complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and cultural differences. Teenage girls, for example, tend to pay attention better than teenage boys. But instead of declaring men finished because of their educational deficits, we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys and young men, and more conducive to their success. Why are we even having this debate about mens demise? The reason is we are living in an era you could call WAW, women are wonderful. Its a phenomenon thats been identified by some psychologists. And it used to be fashionable to celebrate mens superiority over women when women were truly the second sex. Fortunately, those chauvinist days are long gone. Today, a new kind of reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy, female chauvinism. Magazines, TV shows, yes, sitcoms claim, you know, the endless heroics about girl power, "You go, girl," claiming that women are better at everything. Women are better leaders, women are better communicators, all around better human beings. I saw one-story that said women have better orgasms than men. The rules of the WAW game make it impossible for them to -- to win, because if women do something better than men, that's evidence of their superiority. If men outperform women, that's proof of discrimination and the continuing male culture. What you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the WAW phenomenon. The idea that men are finished is crazy. Men and women complement each other. We are not separate teams competing for a trophy. This is not a zero sum competition. We're dance partners like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Our fates are inextricably tied together. If one is in trouble, so is the other. Several years ago the Hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house. They wanted to manufacture -- they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls. The girls came in, and the boys. The girls played constructively with the dolls. The kids took the dolls and played house. The boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof. And the Hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation: Boys and girls are different.

Okay. A reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion, men are finished. We have heard two of the opening statements and now onto the third. I'd like to introduce Dan Abrams. He is chief legal analyst for ABC News. He is also the author of a book whose title is a lot of fun to read. It's called "Man Down: Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt that Women are Better Cops, Drivers, Gamblers, Spies, World Leaders, Beer Tasters, Hedge Fund Managers and Just About Everything Else. " I notice that you don't say women are better legal analysts. Have you raised the bar for men with your performance?

How the heck did Dan Abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority? Did he do it to meet women? Did he -- did he do it to pander? You know, it's always frustrating for me when I'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book. I did it for both reasons, and it's worked incredibly well. Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, "Man Down," far more attention than it ever would have received. I made a case based on evidence and men's rights groups and others have attacked me, saying, "He didn't use the scientific method in this book. " Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort. So I separate it into two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority. Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men? I presented evidence. I presented studies, research. But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters. So let's put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important. Hanna talked about women as students. They'll be better educated. They'll navigate tough economies better. They'll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation. But I don't know. What about politics, finance, taking care of the planet? These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas. Let's start with politics. Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the percentage of the population. In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent of women voted. 58 percent of men. In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the ballots, by the way, 66-62. Same thing in midterm elections in 2010. 53 percent of those who voted were female. But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men. Four out of five being elected are men. In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats. And for the first time in 30 years, lost House seats. This is true for now. But once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot continue. Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress. The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their male counterparts. Women sponsored more bills. They cosponsored many more bills. They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues. In addition, two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall. And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police officers -- women are less corruptible. Two major international studies, one at the World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey. They took a count of corruption levels within the countries. They took a count of culture, religion, education. The results were clear. The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature. So what the heck's going on? Why aren't there more women? I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it all. They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior. Honesty, overwhelmingly women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied. The only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness. In that same study, though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders. Similar results when it came to newscasters. A rigorous study done, male and female news casters reading the exact same message. The participants agreed that when it came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible. And yet when those same people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men. There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions. Now, finance. You don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance. 2009 and 2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, "For Mother's Day, give her the reins to the portfolio" and "How men's overconfidence hurts them as investors. " Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money. Female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent. Business Week reported that when the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men. Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers. Maybe they have to work harder to get there. Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game. But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves. And all other things equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman. Finally, new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet. They recycle more. They're more likely to be green. They eat less meat. They take shorter trips. In part because they give and follow better directions than men. They take public transportation more. They are also better and safer bus drivers. They save gas by speeding less. They make more eco purchases. Heck, God has decided that men are finished. Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men. So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas? Three reasons: Married or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the overconfidence of men; and three, sexism. When number one may not ever change for certain, number two and three will. They must. And then us men are in big trouble.

"Men are finished," that is our motion and now here to speak against the motion, David Zinczenko, who is executive vice president and editor in chief of Men's Health Magazine. He is editorial director of both Women's Health and Prevention Magazine and he's a bestselling author. And Men's Health -- it's about fitness, it's about technology, it's about handling your finances, so if men were going down the tubes, you would have your finger on the pulse of all of these --

Thank you, John, and thank you, Dan. I want you to vote against this proposition, against this misguided motion because it's preposterous. Men can't possibly be finished because as all of you know, when men are finished, they roll over immediately and go to sleep. That's not happening. Clearly men are not rolling over. Now, they will have you believe that, that is the case. It's not, if anything they continue to do what they have always done, invent new technology -- makes them smarter -- lead nations, build bridges, drive corporations, yes, win elections, and to your point quite sadly, tweet pics of their genitalia to complete strangers. That's true. Nothing's changed. Now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women now outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economy continues to place greater and greater importance on education. And men are certainly falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession, nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men, yes. Men make up the largest sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the majority of people who ought to be in rehab. And as Jeff Foxworthy might have put it, very few women say as their last words, "Hey, watch this. " It's a fact. Testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men seven years sooner than women. So how can I concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must vote against this measure? It's simple. All of the statistics that my opponents will be citing tonight are indicative of a trend. Women are beginning to catch up to men. But the pace of that progress is inexorably slow. According to the United Nations women perform two-thirds of the world's work, but only earn a fraction of the world's income. Men own 99 percent of the world's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign nations. Now, I didn't get through all of Freakonomics, admittedly, but these do not seem like winning statistics for that side. Obviously, the other 150 million American males out there aren't particularly alarmed either. I don't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of this debate out there burning their jockstraps. Men aren't finished. You have to vote against this motion. Now, what's going on? In part it's the biological drive. There is a women's movement for the simple reason that women are willing to move together more as a unit. Men are rugged individualists. They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for directions. So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that. It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role. It was still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine. Its still men who make up 90 percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours. It was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center. And while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, I personally am in awe of Rupert Murdochs wife. We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership. Even women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of masculinity. Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is. Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins. Yes, women are making enormous gains in education. They now earn the majority of graduate and undergraduate degrees. And I feel terrible, just terrible, for Bill Gates and Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming billionaires to finish their homework. Awful. Its so tough. It would have been much better -- It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex. Of course, theres self-made women billionaires -- Oprah, Martha, J.K. Rowling, imaginative visions shared worldwide. But its men who flood the patent offices with their big ideas. And until a woman invents the next Google or Facebook or iPad or bass- o-matic -- -- the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes. So, men are driven to achieve power and influence. Men arent worried about losing out to women. Theyre still too focused on not losing out to other men. Thats why men are not finished. And its why you have to vote against this ridiculous proposition.

And that concludes round one of this U.S. Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being debated is "Men are finished. " All right, so were going to move on to round two, and this is one of those times when I would solicit your highly spontaneous applause. Welcome back to this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. Im John Donvan of ABC News. Were at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. Our motion is "Men are finished," and we have two teams debating this motion. We have Hanna Rosin and Dan Abrams arguing for the motion that "Men are finished. " Theyre saying that as a result of a changing economy and shifting cultural values, men who once, like it or not, were seen as the dominant sex, the bosses and the breadwinners, are now already in a deep slide to number two status. Arguing against them, saying that men are not finished, Christina Hoff Sommers and David Zinczenko. Theyre saying that men are doing just fine, thank you, that they still hold most of the power. And besides, just because women are doing better, that does not mean that men have to be doing worse. Were in round two where the debaters are going to be able to talk directly to each other and take questions from you and from myself and from readers of Slate who are watching this debate online. And Id like to start with initially with a question to the side thats arguing for the motion, and I think perhaps to you, Hanna Rosin. Your opponents are making the case that part of the reason that the notion is afloat, that "Men are finished," is because theres an attitude about, theres a sense that women can only be doing better if men are doing worse, that this is a zero-sum game. So is it? Is it not possible for both sides to do well without this imbalance resulting?
Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|30|R3|HANNA ROSIN|for|1|9|2|0|0|5|2|16|0|0|0|2|19|16|0|3|5|0|0|0|0|83|0|0|0|0|13|0|4|0|0|4|14|0|0|1|2|0|0|0|7|0|2|14|16|16|28|3|16|0|0|0|0|0|22|1|0|3|0|10|23|5|0|4|6|129|It is possible, but it just doesnt work that way. I mean, if we can all agree that there was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over, then I think we agree that men are finished. So the resolution is about male dominance which weve taken for granted for so many tens of thousands of years. And so, even if you have parity, you have the end of male dominance. I mean, if you have women rising and catching up to men, then you no longer have male dominance. And so that's what I meant when I, early on, tried to define the resolution as men are finished, the era of male dominance, it's finished, which we've taken for granted for all this time.

But our system is rigged against them. And if you look into the average classroom, it's a male averse environment. Schools, for example, now don't allow rough and tumble play. There is zero tolerance for male rambunctiousness. You have schools where they don't allow them to play tag where anyone is out. They have to replace it with games like circle of friends, tug-of-war. Tug-of-war has become tug of peace. This is not -- this is hostile to the interests of young men. And it gets more serious if you look at the readings. A friend of mine at Harvard graduate school of education did a content analysis of textbooks, readers for eighth and -- seventh and eighth grade social studies class. She said you'd think the American West was settled by teenage girls traveling with parents. So male heroes have been taken out. Boys are badly neglected.

And if I was out there, and I needed someone, I'd want a big, strong police officer. Well, okay in certain cases. But what if I told you that there is solid evidence to demonstrate that women can defuse a violent situation better than men can? Hmm. Okay. Now instead of having to tackle the guy, you can get the guy to a -- you can avoid a conflict altogether and then avoid taxpayer lawsuits and have less corruption within your police force. Hmm. Suddenly we're looking at police officers in a totally different way. Does that mean that there's no advantage to being faster or bigger? No. But the number of times in real life as opposed to the movies where people are actually sort of running down across the street to catch the guy jumping over the fence is actually pretty far -- you know, it's pretty rare.

That is not good. We need more gender equality. But in their world they have to twist what this debate means. And the fact is if men adjust to the work life realities, they are emasculated and feminized and therefore they lose. If they don't adapt to the new reality, men are emasculated and unnecessary and irrelevant and antiquated, and they lose. So I think women can become CEOs, they can become stay at home moms, they can be considered masters of the new universe, and it is easy to structure in your mind the decline and fall of men when in your own mind when all the rules are stacked against your opponents, but here in the real world there is no truth to the facts.

When you guys say something like "logger," you make it sound like it's a very tiny minute percentage of the population. We're actually talking about 60 percent of the population that's not college educated, okay? So you keep mentioning Bill Gates. This is the American middle class, okay? You tap into the American middle class, I've done a lot of reporting on this issue, it is actually sad. I mean, you see that women are holding up these families, they're in community colleges, the men are struggling, and for some reason they're not getting the message that they have to go to school. So I think we can be in one of two different places. The men could start getting the message that they have to retool themselves, that the factories that their fathers worked for are not going to be there anymore and that they have to do something different, and then we'll end up in a situation that's closer to parity. Or you could end up in a situation where it gets worse and worse and worse and the income -- you know, you have a sort of little upper class of people that these guys are talking about that consists of Bill Gates and maybe the people in this audience and not very many more people and everybody else is sort of struggling with the women holding the bag, it's called the last bag theory where the woman because she's raising the child is also going to school and making the money and the men are just sort of struggling and out of work.

You walk into that high school and you think all the kids are gone because it's so quiet. It's the quietest place in New York City. It's there the kids have to do academic courses, but they can spend half the day working on airplanes. They build mainframes and so forth. Now it has one defect. Its 87 percent male. And so the womens lobby in Washington has put it on a hit list. Aviation High School has one of the best graduation rates. Most of the kids going there are from -- their African American and Hispanic kids living under the poverty line, and their chances of graduating are vastly higher than in any other school, very high college matriculation rate. That is a school that is working, but it now more likely to be investigated rather than replicated. People come to study this school from Finland and Ireland, but in the United States theyre more likely to be visited with a Title 9 lawsuit because were not helping young men find jobs that they might find interesting and be suited for. The -- and Im not talking about feminists. Feminists are -- in my book, I talked about lots of different styles of feminism, and theyre not in favor of this. This is the Womens Lobby in Washington, which is carried away with a very hostile agenda and working against helping young men. Thats the problem. Young men arent getting the help.

I mean, historically whats happened is that women have operated pretty flexibly. Theyve gone in a very short period of time from not being able to work when they were married to not being able to work when they had little kids, to being able to work whenever they wanted in a vast number of professions. I can name a number of professions that have gone from entirely male to entirely female. And you cant name any that have gone the other way around. Why? Because men operate in a narrower range at this point in time. That doesnt mean that they always will, but at this point in time, theyre just not that flexible about their identities.

I want to come to the audience for questions shortly, but first I want to mention this, as I mentioned before. Were very pleased to have Slate as our media partner, and theyre streaming this debate -- thank you. And theyre live streaming this debate on their site, and we have a question from a William Nitrous of New York City who Im going to slightly paraphrase. Hes saying is this just a natural consequence -- Im thinking what he means to say is this perception that perhaps men are finished, is it just a natural consequence of the assumption of superiority among men who, unlike females, didnt have the pressure of needing a college degree to succeed? And the more interesting part of his question, he says, Does this apply outside of America? So I want to put to both sides the cultural aspect of that question. To what degree are we talking about an American phenomenon here and to what degree is it more global?

But whats true is that the United States, were having a hard time finding ways to help young men.

So we always think -- male preference is something that comes up a lot. You know, preference for the first born son. One of the first things I did when I started this research was, on a lark and a tip, I went to go visit fertility clinics because, you know, we all understand that people prefer sons. And it turns out that, no, 75 percent of couples are actually requesting girls. So then I started to ask, well, is this true in these very patriarchal places like South Korea, China and India? Well, you look at the charts, and here's what happened. At some point, technology allowed them, you know, to easily choose a son. And then by the mid '90s, this plummeted. Women started to go to school. Women started to get jobs that they could never have before. And all these strict patriarchal structures started to break down. So you can see all over the world that different things are happening. I mean, China, for example, has a higher percentage of female CEOs than the U.S. does. Why? I think it's because childcare is easier. I think it's because families take care of children. There's all sorts of reasons why culturally that's true.

David, you spoke about financial inequality and how -- whatever, 92 percent of the world's resources are in the hands of men and X percent of the countries in the world are governed by men. Christina, you seem to allude to the fact that anything that women are able to do, it's because men are there to earn money to fund it, which I think might be a little bit more problematic.

When people start thinking about and hearing about and learning about how much more effective female political leaders are, for example, I think that there will be a change. People will vote differently. Remember, when people say to me, well, why are there so many -- look, women should be blaming themselves with regard to voting because women are the majority of the voters out there. But what's interesting is, when you get more female candidates, you don't necessarily get a change with regard to the voting habits of women. So the answer to your question, is I think when it comes to newscasters, when it comes to political leaders, and I think in a lot of these other areas, in finance, I think that ultimately the results will speak for themselves. And that's part of the reason why I think this proposition of men are finished -- you know, while certainly hyperbole, if you look at the results, it's a dangerous world upcoming, not today, a dangerous world coming for men.

I think that universal healthcare is a step in the right direction. Men and women are partners. And once that happens, but it's a long ways away right now, you're right, it's 16 percent of women are in Congress. 16 percent of women are serving on the board of corporations.

However, like I said, there's just all this evidence that men don't respond that well and are not that flexible. People, like she says, people have measured things for many, many years about male preference. People have measured male feelings about male identity. Now, female feelings about what's okay as a woman, and people have measured this for college students and adults have changed radically. Women now think it's much more okay to be aggressive in the workplace. It's much more okay to win. They ask a series of questions. The male identification hasn't -- self-identification hasn't changed basically in 60 years. Men always think it's only acceptable to be a guy in this tiny, narrow range. And they're always defining themselves against women, not towards women, where women are always doing the opposite, which is they're defining themselves as more aggressive, competitive, et cetera. Why? I don't know why. I don't know if that's biology or what. But that's just how it is. So we would hope so, but we don't know.

I wasn't planning to start the standup comedy till next week. I look at this, I see a man and a woman -- a man and a woman, but one style of debate here, one style of debate here. And I'm -- and it just seems that men are finished is just an unfortunate title since both groups seem to be saying it's more about traits. And so my question is, is it -- could it be more men who have more feminine traits, who -- or traditionally feminine traits, who are succeeding. And I'm thinking of people like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, and are succeeding for that reason. Could they then potentially reverse the trend and be more successful than women because there are the --

Again, getting back to some of the statistics that I laid out, that's as a result of risk aversion, now, that doesn't -- that means if you're going to swing for the homerun every time, you're going to hit that homerun more often and you're also going to strike out more often. And yet if you behave more in what is viewed as classically female, more risk averse, you're going to end up with more -- and to use the sports analogy -- singles, doubles, and triples, and as a result have better returns, so just --

So in the sense that, you know, its much more acceptable to be gay now, no, theres no problem with being gay. You know, gay people can get married, they cannot get married, that maybe holds up a world in which its okay for a wide range, like its okay for a guy to be a stay-at-home dad. Theres a new sitcom about a guy whos a stay-at-home dad and maybe you should watch it, you know. Maybe more guys will become stay-at-home dads. So you dont have to feel like super self-conscious if youre a guy whose wife, for example, makes more money than you do, which is a -- which is now almost 30 percent of the population, which, again, was unheard of only, you know, 20 years ago is now fairly common.

So Id like to point out, Ms. Rosin, your whole point seems to be, you know, youre arguing that what we have now is the beginning of a trend. So, suppose that just before Tom Edison invents the light bulb, all the candlestick makers are Irishmen. After Edison invents the light bulb, all those candlestick-making jobs go away, and things look pretty bad for the Irish. But nobody would say that its the end of Irishmen. Its the end of candlestick makers. And weve just had a housing bubble that eliminated a ton of construction jobs. And those construction jobs were overwhelmingly male because men actually had a genetic advantage doing construction. It requires heavy lifting.

We thought, Oh, its just the end of construction jobs. And then in the second recession, we thought, Oh, its just the end of, you know, pipeline fitter jobs, and then we thought its just the end of this and the end of that. And then suddenly we realized, no, its actually the end of the manufacturing era. So you realize that this was a trend that was not going to go away or reverse itself and that all these jobs that men happened to do were sort of shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And they were never going to come back. So, you know, I dont know -- you want me to say its like the end of manufacturing --

If you look at the projections from the labor department, we're going to need vast -- millions and millions of engineers and people that are experts in information technology. And there are still going to have to be people constructing and manufacturing. So it's naive to suggest that we're moving away entirely from jobs that were conventionally done by men. And I just want to go back to one question that was raised before about where do transgendered people and gay people fit in. It was actually -- a lot of my positions about men and women came from sympathy that I had for transgendered and gay people, people that didn't fit into their gender role, because one of the things they tell us is that your gender role is very powerful. And it's not socially constructed. It's something you are born with. And what I urge in my writing is to be respectful, yes, of people who defy the stereotypes of their gender, but also to be respectful of those of us who embody the stereotypes. There are many people who are --

And they are simply adapting better than are men. And that's the really important point here. It's not just that the male jobs are being eliminated.

They're better engineers. I do, in my head what I call the cross-border biology check. Now, what is a cross-border biology check? I try and think, okay, is this just something we think is true because we look at it, and we assume it ever has to be true, while in India, half of engineering students are women. Now, why is that? Because it's encouraged in India, and because that's something everybody has to do. It's not something that men are necessarily better than women at. So I just feel like eventually that will be true here too. We put an emphasis on it, and women will do it.

In countries like -- people often say, Look at India, look at Malaysia. Women are the engineers, and far more women are becoming physicists. In those countries, women don't have as much choice of what they do. Because of economic pressures, they are forced to do careers in a society where there's more prosperity, women have more choice, and they go into other fields. And that's why if you look at what American women are majoring in it's art history and education, all sorts of things. They're not forced to do something they don't want to do. Men do. That is their number one choice in college majors, or it's -- of all the majors, that's the one men choose, I guess, after business. Whereas women, it's teaching. So there are -- there are differences in that, again, I am insisting that we need both in the new economy.

Hello. My name is David, and I am a student here at NYU. And I'm male. But I just wanted to ask, because I've seen that a lot of the debate has been going on about what is considered traditionally male or traditionally female. And I was wondering if it was really possible to determine whether or not men are, quote, unquote, "finished," based on these traditional sort of stereotypical characteristics, because if you look at it, what is considered traditionally female is not what they're right now. Like the female workers in business or economics or whatever tend to have more what we consider traditionally male traits.

So I think that a lot of these things are much more fluid than we think they are. That's why I'm always reluctant to enter into this gender biology question: Women are like this, and men are like this. Women have gotten vastly more aggressive. They are -- they're much, much more likely to get arrested, especially juvenile females than they were 20 years ago. You know, so this is a sort of scale that moves along a continuum.

This is a point first made by Slate magazine's Emily Bazelon who I think it was -- or what I heard is I think it's appropriate to do it here where you're a cosponsor. But the company Wal-Mart recently faced a lawsuit about systematically discriminating against women and whatever you think about the outcome of that. The point was, clearly Wal-Mart wasn't utilizing their -- or empowering their female work force. And all the economic evidence which Wal-Mart would have definitely had at its disposal would suggest that that would be the profit maximizing thing to do. And we all know Wal-Mart loves profit. So I guess my question for the panel is, why is that, and what does that mean for our motion?

The moderator started out by saying that increasingly men are not assuming the responsibilities of parenthood. Both the men on the panel who are middle aged, single and childless would be examples of this. And I'd like to know why they think that this is so often the case these days, men are marrying less and less. Men are not supporting their families. The statistics on the nonpayment of things like child support are astronomical. And that's always been one of the hallmarks of adulthood. I'd like to know what the panel has to say about that.

It's like a shocking phenomenon, 40 percent of American children are now born to single parent households. You could say that's because the women have decided that the men are finished, they don't need them, they don't contribute to the household, the women are the ones doing all the work and going to school and the men are just sort of another child in the house to feed and that's what all the women tell me.

And thats why you should vote against the proposition. No, but -- No, what Im saying is we have set up an obstacle course for young men that makes it -- and were doing a much better job educating young women, supporting young women, encouraging young women. There is -- every scintilla of evidence suggests it. So what we have to do is find a way and, yes, it goes back to the elementary school classroom where we have to support boys. Now am I saying that means men are finished? No, I dont see how you hear that. Im saying weve set up handicaps. Weve set up obstacles.

We are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn. They will be two minute each. And remember how you voted before the debate. Right after these closing statements, were going to ask you once again to vote. And the team that has changed your minds -- most of your minds in the course of this debate -- Im going to say that again. And the team that has most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. So, onto round three, closing statements. Our motion is this, "Men are finished. " And here to summarize his position again, her position -- and here to summarize her position against the motion, Christina Hoff Sommers, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of The War Against Boys.
Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|360|R4|CHRISTINA HOFF SOMMERS|against|5|12|7|1|0|19|0|36|3|0|1|5|45|11|1|2|8|0|0|0|0|189|3|0|1|0|10|2|12|0|0|9|19|0|0|4|5|1|1|10|12|1|6|14|39|26|34|8|33|0|0|0|2|0|25|11|0|3|1|13|46|3|0|5|30|325|I urge you to vote against this proposition for three reasons. Number one, its false. Okay, women are not replacing men. Women are not becoming the first sex. Women are becoming partners with men. Men continue to do most of the arduous and dangerous work, and they are the primary risk-takers and innovators. Society is driven by what the classical economist Joseph Schumpeter called the gale of creative destruction. Women can cause such gales, but it has always been a masculine specialty, and there is zero evidence that that is changing. Now as I said in my earlier remarks, men have been doing less well in the classroom, but this does not herald the end of men. Rather, it means that we have to find ways of making our schools more effective for male students. Reason two you should oppose this proposition: Its chauvinistic. As I said, in the old days, we had female supremacy. Its been replaced by this variety of women are wonderful phenomenon. The battle days of male supremacy are now followed by this female chauvinism. So, I believe that an act in favor of this proposition is a vote for chauvinism. Third and most important, the sexes need each other. They complement each other. They have been known to love one another. As Henry Kissinger once said, No one will ever win the war between the sexes. Theres just too much fraternizing with the enemy. Now women and men do not succeed at one anothers expense. Were on the same team. Were co-dependent. That was true on the African Savanna 100,000 years ago. It has been true ever since. Its true in 21st century America. You can certainly find times when one sex has acquitted itself better than the other, but you will never find examples of one sex becoming irrelevant. Such a development is beyond anything in human experience. I urge you to vote in favor of reality. Thank you.

Our motion is "Men are finished," and here to summarize her position in support of this motion, Hanna Rosin, an award-winning journalist for Slate and The Atlantic.
Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|362|R4|HANNA ROSIN|for|0|11|2|0|0|25|0|41|0|0|2|2|46|20|0|9|6|0|0|0|0|201|3|0|1|0|21|2|12|0|2|4|32|4|0|5|2|1|0|2|3|2|1|19|37|49|52|6|37|0|0|1|0|1|63|12|0|5|2|12|61|7|0|7|28|348|Im going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes. One is from a story called, The Decline of the American Male. Men, this writer says, are endangered species. They are expendable. Another quote: Women have gained in the past century while men have fallen behind. Who is this mystery author? Dave Zinczenko is the mystery author who wrote this story at USA Today in 2009. He keeps saying this is preposterous, this is preposterous. Merely two years ago, he thought that it was true. Now Im going to read you another series of quotes. It is boys who are the second sex. Its a bad time to be a boy in America. The research -- listen to this closely -- commonly cited to support claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors. Who is the mystery author of this article? Christina Hoff Sommers, whos also saying that this is all very preposterous. So, as you can see, its not that preposterous. We can all see the writing on the walls. They keep talking about how men are still running the country. Men are still doing this, men are still doing that. But that's not interesting. That just shows a lack of imagination. As we said, this "Men are finished" proposition, you literally have to think of it as graffiti, as the writing on the wall pointing to an inevitable future. All the signs are there. So -- and then the final thing I want to say is, Christina says this is a vote for chauvinism, that "Men are finished" is a vote for chauvinism. Don't think of it that way. You're actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because I think if we finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need our help, and they might even need some affirmative action, then maybe we would behave the right way, and we would help the men who desperately need our help. So remember, vote for men are finished. "

Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|364|R4|DAVID ZINCZENKO|against|4|15|7|0|0|20|1|33|0|0|5|6|47|18|2|3|10|0|0|0|0|195|4|0|0|0|16|1|12|0|1|3|10|0|1|2|5|0|0|7|6|0|7|12|47|32|31|15|47|0|0|0|0|0|33|21|0|6|3|14|45|7|1|1|27|342|Well, thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you. Hats off to Dan and Hanna. That article, by the way, was arguing for better healthcare for men. There are five offices of women's health in the federal government, zero for men. That was really the context. Now, my opponents tonight have outlined some trends that seem to herald the final decent of the American male into a metaphorical trash heap of irrelevance and impotence. They are trying to bury legions of men alive, okay? You have to vote against this measure. Sure, there are some worrisome trends. They went through them, okay? And as we all know once a trend starts, it keeps going on forever. That's why all of our houses are worth so much more today than they were in 2007. Now, in the end, there are two reasons why you must vote against this motion, because they might be wrong, but they might be right. Now, the first point, consider this: Gender equality is something, we can all agree on, as an ideal. But if we are approaching gender equality, why are there fewer women in government today than there were ten years ago? Why is it so much easier for men to hold onto their gun rights than it is for women to hold onto their reproductive rights? Not only aren't men finished, but women haven't even begun. Let's at least get to the point where the game is tied before we start writing all the men off. Let's imagine, though, that the trend toward greater female political social and economic power continues unabated. Highly unlikely because the great recession started with men and now it's starting to hit predominantly female jobs more than before. And the scales are tilting. So the more educated independent single women there are the more wonderful the world will actually get for men, okay? So regardless of whether we one day achieve gender equality, men are not finished. And by the way, women are not either. You have to vote against this measure.

Men are finished|i2Debates/men-are-finished.p|366|R4|DAN ABRAMS|for|3|17|5|0|0|20|1|33|4|1|6|3|54|17|0|5|11|0|3|0|0|190|6|0|0|0|16|4|8|0|0|9|28|0|0|6|8|0|0|2|10|4|5|19|47|34|48|6|34|1|0|1|0|0|45|13|0|8|3|9|58|5|0|6|22|316|It seemed at times that our opponents were pleading to you as a moral matter to vote against this. It would be wrong, be horrible. Look what would happen? You would make the guys feel bad. Look, the reality is that we're not just talking about women catching up. We're talking about women surpassing men. Both Hanna and I have talked to you in depth and at length about how significantly women have not caught up but surpassed men in very significant areas in our society. David mentioned before that you're not going to see jock strap protests outside. That's right. That's part of the problem is that men are not alarmed by the situation. And that's one of the main reasons that men are finished, is they don't seem to care. They think -- they think it's cool to be a slacker. It's not. Dave mentioned the Chilean mines and the miners there as an effort to sort of pull at your heartstrings. There's no question that that was a heartfelt moment. But what if a woman had designed that mine? I'm guessing that we might not have ever had that sort of problem. I will end with one note from my book which is that there was a study done on how long it takes men and women to get ready to leave the house. And this study, in England, of 2,000 people showed that men take, on average, four minutes longer. When you think about a Saturday night, no question women will take longer to get ready to leave the house. But when you think about the realities that women face every day of bringing up children, of working a job very often, of doing all the hard work and trying to get ready to leave the house, it starts to make sense. And if that study's true, then men really are finished.

We've never done that. And a woman came up with that idea. Number one, number two, undecided is number three. All right. We're going to have the results very, very quickly. I want to just talk a little bit about a couple of things that are coming up. But first I want to thank the debaters for the quality of the arguments that they brought here. And for the unique and difficult to achieve combination of being serious and intelligent while also a lot of fun at the same time. This is also normally the point in the evening in which I thank the audience for its great questions. And I -- I want to say that it really pleased me to see those neurons firing rapidly, and in some cases randomly. But -- but all of you for having the guts to get up and face this and face what I was doing. In any case, I really appreciate it. And as an audience, you actually have been spectacular, wonderful and very vocal. So thank you very much for this evening. We'd like to thank Slate for being our media partner for live streaming this debate and for bringing questions to us and for being part of this in the future as well. So -- we're back here again on Tuesday, October 4th. Our next debate has this motion: "Grandma's Benefits Imperil Junior's Future. " Arguing in support of this motion, we'll have Margaret Hoover. She is author of "American Individualism. " It's a political manifesto that evokes her great-grandfather, Herbert Hoover's, emphasis on the values of civic responsibility. Joining her as her teammate is Mort Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report who wondered, in a recent op ed, how, quote, "a country of pioneers and self- made men could evolve into a culture of entitlement. " Arguing against this motion, we're going to have Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, six-term governor of Vermont, a physician and one-time candidate for president in 2004. And his partner will be Jeff Madrick editor of Challenge magazine and author of "The Case for Big Government. " And that argues -- that says that engaged government, a big government of high taxes and wise regulations is necessary to ensure America's social and economic security. You can find a full listing of all of our fall debates in tonight's program and also on our website where tickets are available for purchase. All of our debates, as we've said already, can be heard on NPR stations across the country, including WNYC here in New York and also watched on WNET's 13, WLIW and NJTV. And don't forget to follow Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter and make sure to become a fan of Facebook. And if you do, you will get a discount on future debates. Okay. I'm going to announce the results. And I want to do it this way. So these debaters have spent the last hour plus trying to win you over to their point of view on our motion, "Men are finished. " We had you vote once before the debate and once again at the end of the debate. Both of those votes are now in. And here are the results. Before the debate, with the motion being, "Men are finished," 20 percent were for the motion, 54 percent were against, and 26 percent undecided. After the debate, 66 percent are for the motion. That's up 46 percent. 29 percent are against. That is down 25 percent. 5 percent undecided. That's down 21 percent. The side arguing for the motion, "Men are finished," has carried our debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S., we'll see you next time.

My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. And tonight's concerns, obviously, Obama's jobs plan. Congress should approve Obama's jobs plan piece by piece, since the whole thing is no longer at issue in the Senate. The U.S. economy is cruelly stagnating. Unemployment is stubbornly above nine percent. And we risk a serious contraction if Europe fails to deal effectively with its own debt crisis. While we do need to address the federal government's fiscal position in the medium term, the short term need is for government to encourage jobs creation. President Obama's plan does target the short term, specifically fiscal 2012, with a variety of measures. These include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which is currently in effect. This is Economics 101. By decreasing the cost of labor, the payroll tax holiday encourages business to do more hiring. Another element of the plan is infrastructure spending, putting construction labor back to work for needed improvements to our roads, bridges, airports and the like. The plan will create 1.9 million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output. Where is a counter argument? It's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past, naively hoping for a different result this time. At nearly half a trillion dollars, the plan adds around 40 percent to the already staggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year. Even accepting administration claims at face value, it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficit spending to put a single worker in a job for one year. Moreover, it's arguable that the extra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions that favor unions and discourage employers. Both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow, consumers must have the confidence to spend, and businesses must have the confidence to invest and to hire. Will the passage of President Obama's proposals restore confidence that our government is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start the economy? Or will it destroy confidence by portending higher deficits, higher taxes, higher inflation and a bigger regulatory burden in the years ahead. The decision is yours. And we've assembled here an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide. It's my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.

Thank you. And I'd just like to invite one more round of applause to Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible. True or false, Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece? That's what we're here to debate, another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. We're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece. Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it. And only one team will win. And you, our audience here at the Skirball Center, a packed house, will decide the winner. Let's meet our debaters. Arguing for this motion that Congress should pass the jobs plan piece by piece, a former economic advisor to President Obama and a professor at Princeton University, Cecilia Rouse. Her partner is one of the nation's most prominent economic forecasters, chief economist of Moody's analytics, Mark Zandi. Putting the "Not" in the proposition, Congress should not pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece, this team includes an influential thinker in legal academia, a professor here at New York University's school of law, Richard Epstein. And his partner is a libertarian economist who focuses on tax reform and policy. He's a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Daniel Mitchell. Now, this is the debate. One side will win, and one side will lose. And you, our live audience, will pick the winners. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared the winner. So let's now establish the baseline. We're going to go to the preliminary vote. If you go to those key pads at your seat, the way that it works, there are a lot of buttons on it. Pay attention to numbers one, two and three. If you agree at this point with this motion that Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece, push number one. If you are against this motion, push number two. And if you are undecided, push number three. You can ignore the other keys. And if you feel that you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in the last vote. So as the end of the debate, we will reveal this number that we're registering now and the second number. And by that, you will pick our winner. Okay. So we go in three rounds. And round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. Our motion is, "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece. " And here to argue for that motion, Mark Zandi. He is chief economist of Moody's Analytics where he directs research and consulting.

Thank you, John, thank you Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here. And it is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals. It's an honor to be here. I'm going to make four points in my opening remarks. Point number one is that I think there are a number of different reasons for why the Obama jobs plan should be passed. I'm not going to go through all of them. Cece's going to go through some of her reasoning. But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a recession. And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't. The economy is obviously struggling. This is very obvious by looking at the job market. If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average. Just for context, we need almost double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment. And unemployment is already 9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher. This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune from where we were at the start of the year. I mean, it's hard to remember back, but just think about January, February, March, April. We were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs per month. And I was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects. But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events. In fact, John, I say they're unpredictable, largely because I didn't predict them. Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict, and even with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred, 125 billion more on gasoline this year than last. And by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year. So we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank. It didn't provide the juice that we were hoping for, but I think it forced all the recession, very helpful. The Japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth. But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very egregious policy errors. Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate. I think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment. It's not that people are pulling back yet. It's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs. But they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're in. I do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the odds of recession are very serious. In fact, I think they're better than even. Because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth. GDP is the value of all the things that we produce. They'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost a couple percentage points. The good economy, a solid economy that's growing strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint. A weak economy, the economy that we're in today, I think would be pushed into recession. So we've got to make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is currently. Point number two, I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to date has been effective. I think it succeeded. The purpose of physical stimulus is not to provide a source of long term economic growth. It's about ending the recession. In fact, the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of the Obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- a few days. The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09. And by the way, in February '09 we lost 750,000 jobs. The economy was in freefall. By June the economy was growing again, GDP, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the recession was over by February 2010, one year later. We were creating jobs. And over the past year and a half since February 2010, we've created well over two million jobs. It's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much more serious recession. In my view, we would've suffered a depression. The stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession, jump starting an economic recovery. Third point -- did I tell you how many points I was going to make?

The third point -- just testing, making sure you're paying attention -- -- third point is that the Obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years, 250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in temporary spending increases. You know, not all of the pieces of the package are made equal. In my view, the most important element of the plan is the extension of the payroll tax holiday for workers. If we do not extend that, taxes for everyone will rise on January 1, 2012, and again, given this economy, that would be a very significant problem. There are elements of the plan that are really quite creative, some of which Cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and hire people. There are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that I think has wide bipartisan support, and there's some really creative elements with respect to infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure, and the most important thing you should know, it is all paid for. This is not a deficit of finance. It will be paid for by -- at this point, the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people who make a million dollars a year. Now, that's a negative. I don't like raising taxes on anybody, but I think that's a modest negative in the context of, again, not going back into recession. And finally, point number four, this is very important, the jobs bill is only one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track. We also need long term economic policy, but we have -- Congress and the administrative have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal, and we need tax reform. So we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code, make it fairer, less complex, and put our businesses on solid ground. So this is only the start of what we need to do. It's not the end. I want to thank you very much for your kind attention. We just can't go back into recession. Obama's job plan will ensure that we don't. Thank you.

Its a real honor to be here, especially with such a distinguished group of co-panelists. As a matter of fact, I think what am I doing here? Im sort of like the SAT answer, one of these things is not like the other. But hopefully, since I am representing the Cato Institute, I want to give people a very good impression about what libertarian philosophy of left government and individual freedom is all about. And the way Richard and I are going to divide up our responsibility, Im going to look at sort of the macro issues of stimulus and Keynesianism and Obamas Jobs Act. And hes going to look at some of the nitty gritty details. That of course enables me to do the easy part and him to do the hard part. And I want to divide my part up, the macro part looking first at the theory and then at the evidence. Now Keynesians say that whenever the economys weak, the government should borrow money, spend the money, or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or fashion. The goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in peoples pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy. And that sounds very plausible. It makes sense. Were all going to have money in our pockets. Were going to go out and spend money. That has to do something good for the economy. Theres only one little problem with the theory. Where does the government get the money? Government can print money. Government can borrow money. Government can tax money. But theres no way the government can put money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the economy. And what is it that were trying to do? What is a recession? A recession means that our GDP, which used to be this much, is now this much. This by the way is a West Virginia PowerPoint slide here. What is it that we want to do? What is economic growth? Economic growth means were going to take this GDP and we want it to be higher. But what is Keynesianism? What is stimulus at least as its defined inside Washington? Stimulus inside Washington is well lets money from the economys right pocket and put it in the economys left pocket. But are we doing anything to increase this blob called GDP? No, were not. My contention is that what Keynesianism does is it redistributes national income, usually in ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become Santa Claus and buy votes, but our goal should be not to redistribute national income; we want to increase national income. We want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice, thats what economic growth is all about. Let me give you an example that I think makes this clear. This is actually a quiz. Its not like the thing where you get to vote twice. By the way, if you let them vote five times, you could rename this Chicago. Heres a little quiz that will determine whether or not youre qualified to be a member of Congress. Lets divide this room in half. Lets borrow all the money out of the pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of the room. Now heres the quiz. Raise your hand if you think theres more money in the room. Im sorry, none of you are allowed to be in Washington because you have failed your elementary test on Keynesian economics. And if you look at whats happened. If you look at the evidence for Keynesian economics, for stimulus, whatever you want to call it, what do we find? I dont think we find very good results. You can go back to the 1930s, Hoover and Roosevelt were both Keynesians. Hoover increased government spending by 47 percent in just four years, that was a period of deflation so it was actually more than 50 percent in real terms. The economy didnt do any better. Roosevelt in eight years, from 32 to 40, increased government spending by more than 100 percent. Unemployment stayed high, the economy stayed in recession. Now, let me give a little bit of humility, first, on behalf of all economists. If you ask five economists a question, youll get nine answers . We have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions. Were not very good at these things. And especially when youre looking at something like the overall macro economy. Theres trade policy, theres regulatory policy, theres labor policy, monetary policy. There are all of these different things going on in the economy, not to mention some of the exogenous factors that Mark talked about. Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, oil price shocks, you name it. And now were expecting to look at one little slice of all of these different policy levers, fiscal policy, and were supposed to make sweeping judgments about what exactly it means. Of course at best all were really doing is guessing. But if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like Hoover and Roosevelt increasing government spending, it doesnt seem to have worked. But its not just the 1930s. Gerald Ford had a Keynesian tax rebate package in the 1970s. It didn't work. Japan has had, by some accounts, 16 different stimulus packages since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s. Those haven't worked. Bush had a Keynesian stimulus package in 2008. It didn't work. And then, of course, Obama more recently has done the same thing. And time after time after time we don't seem to be getting very good results. Now, I'm not up here to make partisan points at all. What I think of policies that have not worked very well, you'll notice that I've listed Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. But if you ask me what should happened, if you ask me for the success story, I look at things such as the Clinton years and the Reagan years. And this should make Cecilia happy because she worked for the Clinton administration before working for the Obama administration. She did a good job her first time around. Her second time, maybe not so much. But if you look at what happened during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, and you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the Frazier Institute, economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the Heritage Foundation, their economic freedom of the world index, or the world economic forum's global competitiveness report, you will see that during the Reagan years, during the Clinton years, you had more economic liberalization, more freedom, a reduced burden of government spending. And that's why I think we got better economic results during those periods. Now, I'm running out of time, so let me go ahead and say something about what should happen, because obviously I'm up here trying to convince you to vote against the motion. In some sense, politicians should follow the Hippocratic Oath. First, do no harm. And I do worry that when politicians, especially driven by that short- term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases, oh, we're doing something. They want to show that, oh, we care. You know, what was that, the first President Bush went up to New Hampshire in '92, message, "I care. " I mean, boy, talk about an empty, vacuous statement to make. But that's how most politicians think. They really are driven by this desire to try to demonstrate to voters that they really are concerned about your best interests, when in reality, in many cases, at least part of their decision making is driven by their desire to get more votes. So I don't want --

We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. I'm John Donvan of ABC News. And we have four debaters, two teams of two arguing out this motion: "Congress should pass Obama's job plan piece by piece. " You've heard the first two debaters and now onto the third. Arguing for the motion, I'd like to introduce Cecilia Rouse. She's a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. From 2009 to 2011, she was on the inside. She served as a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. And Cecilia, I want to ask you about Thanksgiving at your house, because I understand you have a physicist father and a physicist brother, and you're an economist and three PhDs. Maybe there's a fourth one in the family somewhere. So what, do you talk numbers and formula all through --

You're an economist, and your sister's an anthropologist. You're getting weaker as you go.

It really is a pleasure to be here tonight. And, you know, Dan really said it right when you said you have five economists, you really only get nine opinions. I think you get many more. I was in the Clinton administration. Those were good years in the '90s. I think many people might interpret those times, though as that the Federal Reserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the Federal Reserve was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetary policy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth. In contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a Fed that cannot do as much as it normally can in normal times. Interest rates are near zero. It's near zero, lower bound. You can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to have more fiscal policy. But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures. I'm a labor economist. I got into economics because I was worried about the unemployed, and I still am. There are 14 million workers in the United States who are unemployed. Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months. There are another two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given up looking. And there's about nine million who are working part time, but who would actually like to work full time. So they're working part time for economic reasons. We've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth. But we've also had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth. And as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small R. It's just fledgling. And as Mark pointed out I'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far enough along. Now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose for us going forward. When workers become displaced, they do not earn -- they have, going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10 to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement. It has impact on their children. Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward. It is going to affect the earnings of their children. And look at all of the young people today who are finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even getting started into the labor force. So we know that these have the potential to really hold back economic growth going forward. So yes, I support the Obama plan. I support any plan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another double-dip recession or having more downturn. Now look, last year, I was at the Council of Economic Advisors. And things were looking a lot better. And as a result, if you listened to the president's State of the Union, what he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but were really towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation. And I believe that they are very important. And we all believe that. But we don't have the economy today that we had just six, nine months ago. And therefore, I think the time is right for Congress to act. Now, let's first talk about the pillars of what -- the major components of this plan and what it would do. So first of all, about 40 percent of it is putting money in the hands of individuals. Okay. Some people may say, well, look, that's putting money in their pockets. They're not doing much. But let's talk about it. So the tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned about $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, I should say. It was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more. It continues the federally funded unemployment insurance benefits. Now, let's talk about that. Six million workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits. They lost their job through no fault of their own. These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog. It's only replacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320 a week. And we know that that's about a third of the family income. It helps them to pay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table. It helps them to support their local businesses, et cetera. And that's the way in which it helps to support the economy. The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits are one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short term. Important we can talk more about this. I know many believe that this is not the time to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits. And I would argue this is exactly the time to do so. It also -- let's face it, the private sector is the most important source of job growth in this country. They provide 80 percent of the jobs. So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs program. It's about trying to stand up the private sector. So another 20 percent or so are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business. So I teach microeconomics. Firms do business by having labor and capital. I hope that's as geeky as I get tonight. And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as lowering costs of hiring workers. Again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the employee but to the employer now. And it also provides an extra incentive for firms to bring on more workers. And lastly, as I mentioned before -- all of those should help in the next year. But we know we're going to be in this for a little while. It takes a while to recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector. And so 20 percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually one of the pillars of economic growth. Now, as Mark mentioned, there are some innovations in the way some of this money would be spent. In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states to provide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers. There is encouraging states to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying off workers and keeping some-- they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporary downturn, through work sharing. It encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging states, some of which already have them, including my own state of New Jersey -- help making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their business while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they currently are not technically allowed to do. And it also starts an infrastructure bank which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of these public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of a return in order to do. So I think that it's a balanced package, and I think it hits a lot of the right parts. As Mark mentioned, it's paid for. We can talk more about the way it's paid for. You know, the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03 percent of American taxpayers. So, in closing, yes, I support a program that will provide support to this economy today because I am very worried about how families are getting by. We have 46 million families living in poverty. I'm worried that our recovery is fragile. This doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have more robust growth going forward, but I just don't happen to believe that these aren't mutually exclusive. Maybe hope springs eternal, but I think that Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time, thank you.

Our motion is "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and now here to speak against the motion, I'd like to introduce Richard Epstein. He's a professor of law here at New York University Law School, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a professor of law emeritus and senior lecturer at the University of Chicago where, interestingly enough, given the context, a colleague you used to bump into in the hallways, an adjunct professor was named Barack Obama --

It was very difficult to read the man, and that's why it was that he was such a great poker player. But the question is not whether he could play poker, it's whether or not the statute that he proposes is one that will do the things that we want it to do. And in this debate, there is no disagreement over the sad state of the American economy and the need for something to be done. The question is how it should be done, what should be done, and why. And I'm a lawyer, and I'm with three economists, and I have at least one comparative advantage or disadvantage as the case may be, I actually spent time reading the statute to see what it says in order to figure out whether or not the pieces make any sense. And it's interesting that you can talk about this at the macro level, but it's also extremely important to talk about it at the micro level, and so let me tell you some of the pieces which I think are positively self destructive and ought never to see the light of day. One of the truly misguided features of the stimulus program of 2009 was the passage of ARRA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which instituted a whole variety of buy American provisions in the bill with respect to those funds which were to be distributed through the government to various kinds of employees. If you look at the kinds of provisions that are created there, it's a massive bureaucracy which is designed to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted. It is the kind of thing which says that you cannot buy from sensible foreign providers if they are expensive and inefficient American providers, then there are huge amounts of administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed. The whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program, and it will turn it into a waste. A similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of Hoover's legislation, the Davis-Bacon Act, saying that when the government gives this kind of money out, you have to pay prevailing i.e. union wages with respect to the money in question. So the stimulus program seems to say, "The way in which you get the most for your money is to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can," and there's no way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to the legislation in question. A third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an anti-discrimination act which says that you cannot discriminate against people who are unemployed when you decide whom to hire. That of course is an extremely complicated provision. It has about four separate pages to it, and there's an exception which says that, "Yes, you can take into account their job record under these circumstances. " So any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running -- exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits. But of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire somebody who's already employed, that opens up a position for somebody else. So what you have to understand is at these particular levels, all of the micromanagement is counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question. Then the next thing that we've heard about, and was praised mightily, was the payroll reduction tax for a single year, and what happens is we know what's wrong with this tax because we've been told so by our opponents in this case. Employers are not people who are foolish. They understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run, they don't only look at this year's rates, they look at next year's rates as well. Our objective with respect to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth. We cannot do that, say, to people -- hire people this year, train them for 26 weeks, and then when you get to next year, what's going to happen is you're going to go back to the higher rates of taxation. People will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to achieve. You must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is going to be able to succeed. Any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed to failure. There is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion. So then the question comes, and Ill talk about this for the remainder of my time, what is it that we ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons that the Obama tax plan is doomed to failure? And it seems to me what we have to do is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic policy. So as a lawyer in particular, one of things that impresses me is at the same time we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect to macro policies, we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed. So if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question, just take for example, as one particular, the decision of the administration to chase after the Boeing company with respect to its decision to locate a plant in Columbus -- or Charleston rather, South Carolina. The net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down, an employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be faced with a government prosecution. This is not an incentive to create new plants and new jobs. In effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers, over jobs in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place. When you start looking at the other micro things, for example, in 2005, what we decided to do was to raise the minimum wages. And it seemed to be a fine thing because those were optimistic days. But if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same time that the minimum wage is moved up, whats going to happen is at the lower level youre going to find that its very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job. And the point that was already said, namely if you dont get the first job, youll not get the second and third job is in fact something which has been done. So this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the circumstances of this case. And the list can go on. The government has decided that what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board. If youre a small business trying to go in, its just a wonderful thing to note that after youve been in business for three or four weeks, all of a sudden youre hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize, youd better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands. There is no way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that youre trying to subsidize it at the top. And also there is at present, the Obama legislation which is essentially designed to create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to predicate itself upon the employment relationship. And these again are implicit taxes. So the final message that I want to leave you with is this. The way to deal with labor problems is not to talk about earthquakes; its to talk about labor markets. And the way to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances to get gains from trade, they will return to the hiring market. Thank you.

We take questions from you. Our motion is "Congress should pass Obamas jobs plan piece by piece. " We have two teams of debaters. We have Cecilia Roust and Mark Zandi who are presenting the argument in favor of this motion and in favor of the jobs plan, arguing that they feel that it is absolutely critical to avoiding another recession. That workers who are not floating, who are sinking, are going to lead to no growth in the economy and if anything, a step backward, that this program at a minimum, at a minimum puts a stop in there. Arguing against them, Richard Epstein and Daniel Mitchell who argue that this is essentially another stimulus plan, that historically stimulus plans do not work and that it is rife with all kinds of bureaucratic induction of distorted enhancements that will make it difficult for businessmen simply to hire people and make decisions going forward. And therefore, if it were passed, it would never work. Thats where the two sides stand on this. And I want to start with the question to the side arguing for the motion and to Mark Zandi. With your opponents arguments very strenuously. But essentially this is a stimulus program, and I think you agree with that, and you're saying that, in your argument, that this is needed to avoid a recession. And you have argued that stimulus programs have already worked in this administration in doing good. I wanted you to take on their argument that historically, that's not the case at all.

I think fiscal stimulus is a tried and true policy response to recession. Since every recession since World War II, we've had fiscal stimulus. In fact, the degree of fiscal stimulus provided is commensurate with the severity of the recession, at least as measured by the unemployment rate. And in fact, one could argue that the fiscal stimulus that was provided in this recession, the great recession, was inadequate. It was not proportional to the severity of the recession. And that's one of the reasons why the economy hasn't engaged to the degree that I think most would have thought at this point. Moreover, I'm not alone in this view. Cece brought up the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is a nonpartisan group respected by both Republicans and Democrats. They score the various proposals made by policy makers, tax policy and spending policy. And they do studies of various stimulus packages. And they released the estimates on the impact on GDP, on jobs, unemployment on a regular basis and they show consistently that they believe that this had been --

At the time that the Obama administration introduced its first stimulus program, there was a confident prediction supported by the CBO that it would lower the unemployment rate down to eight percent. Nothing of the sort happened. It stayed exactly dead level under the circumstances. So the question is, why is this going to happen? And essentially the CBO scores in a very static way. It listens to what the administration says about the number of dollars they're going to spend and the cost for particular jobs, and it thinks that economics is a form of multiplication and subtraction and addition. The problem is the money has to come from somewhere. And the basic tradeoff that you have is this: If in fact you decide to run this thing through a stimulus program, you must raise taxes. If you raise them, as is now proposed on the most productive individuals in society, it turns out that you're taking money from the hands of people who know how to use it and to put it into the hands of a government which simply does not. So the prediction is, at this particular time, what will happen is exactly the same thing that happened before. There will be a short-term burst, and then magically, there will be another earthquake, and the program will fail.

But if you actually look at the -- in our experience over time, there's not a great relationship between the highest marginal tax rates and how we're doing in terms of economic growth. If you look at Reagan, he lowered tax rates for high income individuals. Clinton increased them. And you saw somewhat greater economic growth under Clinton than under Reagan. So I think the evidence tells us that, yes, there is -- these are tax rates. So I'm not going to say that there's no impact at all in terms of lowering economic growth, et cetera. But it's very small for the highest earners because they don't spend the tax cuts. And it doesn't have that big of an impact on their earnings. You know, some have looked at what some of the highest paid CEOs did with their tax cuts. Some of them, it's true. They exercised stock options creatively and strategically. But in terms of their general income, which is really the income-generating activity, there was really no impact. So I actually think that this is -- I think it's a small tax increase today, but -- not today, it's in a couple of years, and that it'll be at a time when the economy can actually sustain it.

One good thing about being a libertarian is I don't have to respect the CBO because CBO, like a lot of the Keynesian models, they presuppose their results. It's just a mathematical formula. If the mathematical formula is wrong, if they automatically assume that if the government increases spending by X, the economy goes up by Y, and they never pay attention to the fact that while the economy actually went down by Z, they say, well, it would have gone down by more than Z if it wasn't for the government spending. So it's sort of this perpetual motion machine of economics. The White House in 2009 said if you pass the so-called stimulus, the unemployment rate will never rise above eight percent. And instead, it's never dropped below nine percent.

These are not going to have long-term benefits. You're eating your seed corn. Remember, tax revenues are down to an all- time low. Government expenditure is to a high. You now have 40 percent of the budget which is being financed by deficits. And the question is, how long is that going to be sustainable? There is an optimism in your position that somehow or other we can go from short-term stuff to long-term stuff, and yet there's no explanation as to how that transition is to be made--

I mean, that's more obvious, right? So February '09, the stimulus, the one that we're focused on, most people are focused on, passed. It was mid February '09, I believe. In February '09, we lost literally 750,000 jobs. We lost 750,000 jobs in January, we lost 750,000 job in March. The economy was shrinking rapidly. We were in a free fall. By June, the recession was over, not by my definition, by the National Bureau for Economic Research. By one year later, we were having job growth. So, okay, you could argue maybe the economy magically would have found its footing without help from the federal government. And I'm not saying stimulus was the only thing. There were many policy responses. There was the Federal Reserve. There were the TARP programs. There were lots of different things.

And then you've depleted their future resources, and there's nothing left to recoup. And the question here is long-term sustainability. As Cecilia said, if you're worried about labor markets, keep people out at the beginning, and it's going to affect them for the rest of their lives. And so what I don't understand is why don't you take up the proposals to deregulate the labor markets to increase the expansions from gains from trade?

And one of the most interesting periods is when we didn't try Keynesianism. The recession coming out of World War I was very steep. We didn't do anything. The economy recovered very rapidly. And probably even more interesting is what happened after World War II. All the Keynesians thought we were going to have a giant recession. They wanted to plan massive public work spending and things like that. But Republicans control Congress. We had gridlock, we had stalemate. That turned out to be a wonderful thing. Because government didn't do anything and the economy relatively quickly digested millions and millions of people of being demobilized from war. In other words, the Hippocratic Oath about do no harm I think really applies, not to mention the fact that at some point we should consider why do we get recessions in the first place which in many cases is because of government policy mistakes, housing subsidies, easy money policy by the Fed, and things like that.

And so clearly money has to go there, but if you look at this particular statute and the elaborate hoops that you have to go through, it is not a bill which is designed to promote infrastructure. It is a bill which is designed to make sure that the president's supporters, strong union members get jobs which will allow them to contribute to the campaign to win. The difference between this particular -- -- well, I'm glad to see that you all approve. But if you look at this program as against for example, the WPA, the administrative overlay that you have here is very, very much higher, and if you look at the way in which this relates to the employment jobs, the last stimulus program that was designed to deal with infrastructure was capital intensive and labeled weak, so that it had absolutely nothing to do, whatsoever, with jobs. So my own view about this is the infrastructure question should be handled on its own merits. It should not be bundled in with the stimulus bill, and once you get that right, if you look at this particular bill with its new and it's four for the president, and three for the other side, that's the last thing that you want to have running this kind of program.

You're arguing for consistency, and I think that's fine, but if you're doing this as sort of an academic debate, the question is consistency, meaning getting rid of it across the board or keeping it across the board. And the question is -- that Dan put to you is how do we figure out, in theory, which way we want to go, and here's one simple device. If you don't know what you're doing, don't spend government money to do it. And these things are highly problematic, completely protectionist, and so, therefore, their elimination is something which is a matter of first principle should want, not only here, but in all the other bills. Davis Bacon is a public outrage, and there's no reason why we ought to extend it.

Okay we passed the stimulus. And the way we will judge whether a policy is effective, we say what would have happened had we not done so. So we passed it. I dont yet have a time machine. President doesnt have a time machine, so we cant go back and unpass it and see what would have happened had we not passed it. Therefore what economists have to do is try to say, try to create that counterfactual, what would have happened in its absence. Okay, Im very sympathetic to the Keynesian multipliers, just sort of mindlessly applying the multiplier and saying what would happen.

And thats their way of doing a counterfactual in a sense. Im a micro-economist. My job is, I do a lot in education, its to do a lot of evaluation of programs, so that doesnt make sense to me. But what does make sense to me, is that therere some economists that have not taken that route but have said instead, well can we compare the outgrowth of, or the employment growth in states where theyve got more money, or in localities where they got more money than in others. Now, you might worry that okay, well but why did some get more money than others. Maybe you got more money because you were doing more poorly. Theyve tried to adjust for that in very creative and credible ways I might add. And this is not by economists that were working for the Obama administration or really had a dog in the hunt. And what they find is, it was actually fairly positive as well. So Im fairly convinced that not just with one methodology do we find that the stimulus made a difference, but using a variety of them. Will we ever know for sure? No. I can see that because I think thats what my business --we have to be humble about that.

Well be debating, well all be 80 years old up here having the same debate. But I do think looking at history, looking at periods where we tried Keynesianism versus periods when we didnt, I think there is a pattern there that supports the negative proposition in this debate. Also, you look at countries around the world during this recent economic downturn. Its been fairly global. Counties that were much less Keynesian in their approach, like Germany and Canada, seem to do better than countries that were more Keynesian in their approach like the United Kingdom and the United States. But again, there are 50 different policies out there and were trying to focus on just the narrow issue of fiscal policy. And so it really is a challenge. And I think all of us up here want America to be more profitable and have more jobs. So I think we all start from the same goal, but it really is difficult to figure out whats going to work. But I do look at Europe and the fact that theyve gone down this path of deficit spending and it really does seem to eventually lead you into a cul-de-sac. And theyre in very serious trouble. And I worry about, I have three kids, I dont want America to be like Greece in 15 or 20 years.

Because, one of the reasons why many people believe that, especially Germany, which had a larger, or Germany did not suffer the same employment losses that we did and many people have asked why. And Canada as well, and both of them have work sharing programs, which were very active. So many people believe, and again if you ask German economists what exactly explains it, youll get many answers. But one of the reasons is because German employers were not obligated to try to adjust to the downturn by laying off all of their workers. Thats a lot of the reason why the president actually was looking to Germany and weve been trying to expand our own work sharing program for exactly this reason.

Now, youve mentioned earlier that in, after the First World War, there was a recession, but America survived it, and everything came right. After the Second World War, the same thing. But after two world wars, countries were in situations where they had to build. They had to rebuild. They had to restructure everything. And that, to me, is what President Obama is proposing, is the restructuring, building again to get things going. Do you not think that's -- that was a stimulus all on its own?

The reason I pointed out the recession of 1920, which, if we didn't have the Great Depression that would have been viewed as our Great Depression because the macroeconomic numbers were absolutely terrible then, worse than anything we had ever experienced. And politicians didn't do anything, and the economy quickly recovered. We've always had downturns. And the question is how quickly do we get out of the downturn, what malinvestments and economic mistakes were made, and did the economy have the ability to quickly adjust? My concern about stimulus, if you define stimulus by government involvement and intervention, I think it hinders and retards the economy's ability to adjust and to sort of digest the mistake that caused resources to be misallocated. And I think what's happening today, not only under Obama, but also under Bush, we have gotten to a point where government is so big, so -- you know, just involved in all sectors of the economy, not just spending and taxes, but regulations and intervention, the types of thing Richard was talking about. We have moved to a lower growth level that we may be stuck with permanently in the same way that Europeans have had these, for decades now, slower rates of economic growth.

I return everybody's call. I think I would do both. I think Cece said it nicely. You know, policy makers can walk and chew gum at the same time. And we need to do that. I do sympathize with a lot of the points that are being made with respect to regulatory policy and government intervention. I do think some of the policy steps have created uncertainty for businesses and for the banking system. And that's impaired the ability and willingness of businesses to step up and hire and for banks to lend. So I sympathize with that perspective. And I think we need to work on policies to address that. But that does not preclude the fact that we need to reduce some of the fiscal restraint that's dead ahead of us. If we don't make some policy steps here, taxes are going to rise on everybody. Unemployment insurance for many hard-pressed households are going to expire. And that's the prescription for a recession.

Are we really talking about jobs, or are we only talking about getting money into the system for stimulus? Are people really going to be better employed in the long term as a result of this program?

I think our economy has made significant progress in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess. We've reduced debt. The businesses are in very good shape financially. Households have made a lot of progress. There's work to be done. We've got foreclosure issues. The banking system is recapitalized. We've made significant progress. We're on the verge of a much better economy. But if we go back into recession, all that good, hard work is going to go down the tubes. And this is going to cost us enormously. We go into recession, revenues are going to fall because there's going to be fewer people employed. Government spending's going to rise because there's automatic spending increases in our budget. People become unemployed, they'll go get unemployment insurance. It's going to cost us more than this package, a lot more than this package. So it's not only about the very near term. It's about the long run. We can't take that chance. If we go into recession, it's going to undermine the fundamentals of our economy.

It's about people actually having -- having jobs, having careers, if you will, being able to count on this going forward. And your opponents have argued that one of the problems they see with this, particularly something like -- like the tax holiday that's being offered to employers, it's a holiday, then it ends. And it's so short term that there's no real incentive for a company to hire workers.

This is -- let me try one more time. Listen, if we go back into recession, all those fundamentals of our economy are going to erode. All the good things, all the progress we've made is going is go away, and it's going to hurt the ability of businesses to hire and people to get jobs for the long run, for a long time to come. We are running the risk of going into a Japanese-like decade if we go back in a recession in six to nine months. We just can't allow that to happen.

And you're talking about the short-term disasters. What about the midterm disasters? The advantage of the deregulation on the labor market side, which could be quite big, getting rid of industrial policies, no more cylinders and so forth, is that has an effect today. It has a long-term effect. It reduces the size of government burdens, and it increases the gains from potential hiring of labor. So I'm going to ask you, Mark, just plain out, if you're in favor of this bill. Would you get rid of the Davis Bacon provision and the -- and the ARRA provision and the unemployment discrimination provision? I think the answer's got to be yes.

You don't have to repeal anything. You don't have to have a long-term debate. All you have to say is, not with this one now. And all you've told me is you don't think it's going to do a lot of good.

So many employers have actually been having their ads, when they post for employment, they say, "if you are unemployed, you need not apply. " We'll not consider -- or you must currently have a job. So many employers have this in statute -- or not in statute, but they have that in their ads. And as a result, many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive to employment growth. So, I understand that employers are being inundated with applications and with applicants. There are over four unemployed workers for every job opening. And employers are having to find ways to really sift through. And I also understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire, who they think is the best match. But let's think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest of society, which is where I think we have a place for government intervention. First of all, imagine you're an unemployed worker. Especially imagine you're an unemployed worker who's been unemployed for at least six months. So you're actually bordering on discouraged. I actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is -- you know, marginally thinks she's not very attractive to employers. You understand that employers are putting out these ads, you don't even try to get a job. And the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying, from even applying for jobs. So one is I think it discourages workers from even trying to get hired. The second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs. We have a lot of dynamism in our labor market, and one of the problems we have right now is actually because of the labor market, we have fewer quits than we normally would have, and as a result, workers are staying in jobs, they're not quitting, and so they're not going to be climbing up the career ladder. It's a negative spillover to the rest of society.

And so, therefore, when we're considering what is going to increase -- oh, you're ruining my fun by clapping instead of hissing -- -- so when we're thinking about what in terms of like the boots on the ground type issue, what is going to convince companies to hire workers? If you create a new potential legal liability with new government rules about how you're writing your want ads and who you're allowed to hire and what you're allowed to say when you're interviewing, is that going to increase or decrease the likelihood that companies are going to want to hire new people? We want workers to be an asset to firms, not a liability, and this gets into of course all the other policies about what are the -- if we lower tax rates, will that help? If we reduce government regulation of red tape, will that help? I think markets, I think copying Hong Kong is a better idea than copying France. That in some sense is the summary of everything I would say this evening.

You know, five years ago I used to look at the OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data, international bureaucracy based in Paris. They look at industrialized countries, all sorts of interesting data. I don't think we should be subsidizing them, but that's a whole separate issue. It used to be that you would look at the data on six months-plus unemployment, and Europe had the terrible numbers, and we had the great numbers. And now we've gone up to Europe and in some cases beyond, in terms of our long term unemployment. Now, interestingly, scholars like Paul Krugman and Larry Summers, at least when they're outside their New York Times writing and their democratic administration appointments, have written that unemployment insurance subsidizes unemployment. Now, as an economist --

You know, there is money in the package, about 50 billion for unemployment insurance -- additional unemployment insurance, but in addition to that, there are a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance system that have been proposed. When Cece talked about the work share that's very popular in Germany and credited for German success, there's also a very popular program in Georgia called Georgia Works that helps send unemployed workers to get on the job training. These are things that have historically had bipartisan support. There's empirical evidence that they work reasonably well. They do address some of the concerns Dan brought up. I -- they're reasonable concerns. You know, you can't dismiss them. So I think it's very important to realize that in the package there are efforts to address some of these things.

There are obviously going to be some more -- you're talking about millions of companies, and many people get first jobs, and it seems to me that you can -- if you got rid of minimum wage that's for teenagers it would do much more because then what you could do is to handle the problem of your decreased skills which everybody agrees takes place by making a compensating wage offer. And so freeing up markets will do much better than putting additional burdens on the overall economy in the way in which you're doing. With respect to part time workers and so forth, the other thing to remember is we've had a long term policy in which there's constantly the notion that there are mandates for the kinds of benefits that you must supply to full time employees, which leads to this fine art where everybody now tries to become an independent contractor so you don't have to supply health insurance in a variety of other situations. One way to improve the employment situation is to drop the mandate. And put it in another term. What the government has now said, there will be no jobs with lavish benefits or you can have real jobs with less benefits. In my view, if youre trying to increase the employment levels, what you have to do is to stop putting the ties. If you wish to hire X, you must provide for them Y. Because what happens is thats often the decider and it kills the labor markets. What we did for many, many years is to think that labor markets were robust so you could burden them with all sorts of restrictions. When you get bad times, these restrictions are a lot more costly and what they do is they create a lot more devastation. You can improve this market tomorrow.

Now I need some spontaneous applause from you, if you can do that. Thank you. Our motion is "Congress should pass Obamas jobs plan piece by piece. " Were in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. Debate. Im John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, arguing this out and we are talking about the part of the jobs bill that would outlaw discrimination against workers who have been unemployed. And Cecilia Rouse is going to take up the point.
Congress should pass Obamas jobs act - piece by piece|i2Debates/obama-jobs-act.p|189|R3|CECILIA ROUSE|for|1|12|0|0|0|15|0|19|0|0|1|0|23|9|0|5|10|0|0|0|0|115|1|0|0|0|0|1|7|0|0|1|22|0|0|6|9|0|0|1|2|1|0|8|22|20|32|0|18|0|0|1|0|0|10|10|0|4|0|2|27|2|1|5|9|174|So I just wanted to come back to that for just a moment because this law, what this proposes is not saying that employers have to hire a specific person. What it says is one, you cant put it in the ad. Okay that is true, that is a restriction. You cant put in the ad that you will not look at an unemployed person. And two it says that there cant be a blanket policy, so there cant be a memo. So what is -- let me say, its a largely symbolic gesture. The Obama administration caps damages at a thousand dollars if you actually put something in an ad. It caps it at $5,000 if you can come up with, if the EEOC, Equal Opportunity Employment Commission can actually come up with a memo documenting it. So its not, its meant to say look, we need for, at least, there not to be overt discrimination against those who are unemployed so we dont discourage workers from trying to apply to a job.

Which does sound to me like one more layer of somebody making decisions for who you can hire and who you cant and the ultimately this sin that is considered un- committable, you can commit if the government guy says this time well let you go.

And the question is, what do you propose for the short term. I mean, if your proposals all seem to be about long term issues, if were going to do a tax cut, lets make it permanent, that kind of thing. But what do you do for those unemployed people when their payments stop and they cant get a job because there arent enough jobs?

If you repeal the restrictions against people getting jobs, employers will start to hire again. The difficulty with the umemployment situation is that the amount of revenues we have to spend now is probably two or three times the amount of taxes that we collect. And what happens is you will not be able to reverse that pattern so long as you think that stimulus at the grand level --

Get rid of mandates, get rid of minimum wages, get rid of the anti-discrimination proposals and so forth. Because what you laugh about, I think its fine for you to laugh, but I think you also ought to reflect upon the fact that if you dont have gains from trade, you dont get employment. And whats happened is every time you put an implicit tax on the trade, what you do is release the opportunities for gains. This is the interesting feature about this, is the macroeconomic stuff everybody guesses about. The microeconomic stuff is perfectly clear.

Now I come from a school of thought that says that if the economy has misallocation of labor and capital and a recession gets baked into the cake, there's not much you can do but sort of just grit your teeth and try to get through it as quickly as possible. But government sometimes extends and delays and an economic downturn by interfering. I think that's what happened in the 1930s with the Hoover-Roosevelt policies. I want to have a lower burden of government. I sort of throughout, as a throwaway line, I want to be Hong Kong rather than France. But there's actually a very serious point behind it. If you look at all these different measures of economic freedom, Hong Kong's always near the top. And France, among industrialized countries, is down lower. And I think that is one of the reasons why Hong Kong grows five to six percent a year on average, and France grows one to two percent a year. And if we want the unemployed to get jobs, we want a strong, tight labor market like we had during the Clinton years when government spending fell from 22 percent of GDP to 18 percent of

He deregulated telecommunications and agriculture. I mean, if I could take everything else of Clinton's policies and it meant that I had to take the 39.6 percent marginal tax rate, I'd do it. We had a lot more economic freedom under Clinton than we've had under Bush and Obama.

Der good. " What I was focusing on in my comments on Germany is what happened to government spending as a share of GDP. Germany did not do a big Keynesian stimulus program. It doesn't mean that I want to embrace German fiscal policy because the overall burden of government spending is higher, actually not that much higher than it is in the U.S. They're something like 44 percent of GDP. We're getting close to 40 now after the Bush-Obama spending binge. But Germany didn't do a Keynesian stimulus package of any magnitude close to the U.S. And I think that served them well, similar to what happened in Canada. Now, other things were involved. Canada never had a housing bubble. And of course that helped a lot. There's a ton of different economic policies that matter. But my point on Germany was just a simple one, that they didn't do the Keynesian policy --

The difference is that in Germany, they have automatic stable -- what's called automatic stabilizers in their budget. That means that there is more unemployment insurance. There is more welfare. There are -- the tax code is such that you generate a lot more fiscal support. In the U.S., we have some automatic stabilizers, but they're not nearly as large as in Europe. And therefore, when we get into recessions, we rely more on what we're calling fiscal stimulus. That is temporary tax cuts and temporary spending.

There's been some form of stimulus that was the response to each of those recessions? And we have always come out of these recessions and started growing again.

I mean, I think it's a fair question. But, of course, we always came out of them. We're not coming out of them now. So the question is, what's the source of the difference? And the answer is that the degree of regulation that you have with respect to the economy now has deprived it of the kind of flexibility that allows it to respond. And it's in all the markets . Thus far we've talked mainly about labor markets. And those are completely tied up by the kind of regulations that are put into place. Every point and effort to try to revive the housing markets by giving mortgage support programs have turned out to be complete failures. The correct response on that may sound harsh, but in fact, it's the only way to get back the stability which is that banks decide to foreclose, tenants, current owners go, and the property re-circulates at lower rates so that you get the housing market start. You cannot keep a housing market going when essentially you allow people to remain in possession while the underlying value of the assets go down. So our position is really quite this. This stimulus program we don't think it does very much good and has already exhausted itself. But the mid-level regulations that you see in mortgages, in labor, in the banking industry, in the health care industry, all of these things are novel drags. These are discreet programs introduced by --

You like that, huh? Well, if you do the arithmetic, the math, under current policy, if there is no change in policy, federal fiscal policy will shave 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012. State and local governments cuts will take the total fiscal drag -- this is the headwind to the economy -- to two percentage points of GDP. The Obama jobs package provides stimulus equal to two percent of GDP. So the intent is to neutralize the fiscal drag. Now, you know, if I were king for the day, I'd say, you know, we can digest some fiscal austerity. We don't have to go the whole Monty here, but we need to do something. We can't just -- we're not going to be able to digest two percentage points .

I'm sure there are some greater details to it. CPO has the same model, and these are the kinds of models that gave us the White House, I guess, Transition Team document that said if we squandered $850 billion, our unemployment rate would never go above eight percent, and it just didn't work. It doesn't matter how many decimals you have in your estimate. If the fundamental underlying premise is wrong, it doesn't work.

I would like to ask a question to the opponent to this. You seem to be presenting a broader and more long term vision for what you think with deregulation and whatnot. I would like to know how your plan of deregulation in general in the economy would benefit Americans besides the wealthiest of Americans and what specifically this would do by creating, like you say, abolishing minimum wage, creating low paying jobs, how would this really benefit Americans as a whole and not just the top one percent?

The amount of revenue that has been collected from the top one percent in the last -- from 2007 to 2009 declined by about 30 percent, so that what you're trying to do is to hit a top figure and assume that nothing you could do to them can hurt them. They have been hurt in terms of the money they have very much. Oh, laugh, if you may, but remember, 40 percent of that goes into your tax revenues. So every time, what you do is you cut the revenue at the top, you cut the revenue for the programs that are needed to support the stimulus. Dream on if you think that you can avoid that kind of situation. If you reduce income at the top, you reduce the amount of money available for transfer .

The moment they are on the job ladder because employers now find it in their interest, they will advance. When you look at -- for example if people could get in at minimum wage jobs, typically within six months or less they have managed to promote themselves to another type of job. This can take place immediately, but it will not take place by employers unless they have some confidence in the long term stability of the system. Every major tax measure that we have now has a two-year timeframe on it so that the uncertainty dominates in my judgment the kinds of stimulus that you hope to get by the spending policy.

Congress should pass Obamas jobs act - piece by piece|i2Debates/obama-jobs-act.p|274|R4|DANIEL MITCHELL|against|3|23|20|0|0|32|0|24|3|0|11|4|78|26|0|10|15|0|0|2|0|213|2|0|0|0|0|0|22|0|0|7|20|0|0|10|8|0|0|4|5|1|20|15|52|40|37|9|52|0|0|1|2|0|17|20|0|9|1|23|49|8|6|3|14|386|Congress should not pass the president's job proposal either in its entirety or piece by piece because it represents a fundamentally misguided view of the economy, that you can make yourself richer by taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other. I think the historical evidence, the cross-country evidence does not support the Keynesian theory. But more importantly, I think good long run policy is good short run policy. I want to try to get back the labor market conditions we had under Reagan and Clinton, and the one common characteristic of what we had under both Reagan and Clinton was that economic freedom in America broadly defined -- so we're not just talking the fiscal policy, but more than just fiscal policy affects the economy -- economic freedom in America increased during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, by contrast, economic freedom declined during the Bush years, and that decline has continued during the Obama years. And if we accept -- even if we don't like it, if we accept the notion that jobs are only created when employers think that it's going to be profitable to create those jobs, we need to figure out what type of economic conditions will lead to that greater prosperity. And, again, I come back to what originally was a joke line, but I really want to make a premise, why is it that an economy like Hong Kong manages to grow so fast over such a long period of time, it takes in enormous amounts of immigrants, people rise from poverty to prosperity relatively quickly. Thats the kind of economy I want to mimic. Not because I care about the top one percent. The top one percent have never really, I dont know, maybe some of them gave to the Cato Institute, so if youre out there listening, I love you. But I care a lot more about the people at the bottom than at the top. If theres a recession, the Donald Trumps and Warren Buffetts and Bill Gates of the world never have to worry about how their household budget is going to be balanced. Thats why I want to copy Hong Kong. In France, the rich people have figured how to work it; I dont care about them. Thank you.

I want to thank you for the opportunity again. And I commend the other group for articulating their views so thoughtfully. I sympathize with a lot of whats being said by the other group. I do think that the economy is encumbered by regulatory, legal uncertainty. We have made some major changes to our economy, to our health care system, to our banking system. And these are difficult things for businesses and individuals to adjust to. And I do think we need to work hard in reducing that regulatory and legal uncertainty. And we do need to take steps to address our long-term problems. Again I think its vital that we work to achieve fiscal sustainability, to get the long term deficits down so that our nation doesnt go the way of Europe or France. I think tax reform is absolutely vital. I think its key to bring down the tax expenditures, the tax credits and deductions in the tax code, make the tax code much fairer, simpler. I think our economy would be better for it. And I actually am quite optimistic about our economic prospects. I think, as I said earlier, we have come a long way. Our economy has righted a lot of the wrongs that got us to this point. Were really very close. We just cannot go back into recession in the near future. That would be damaging, the collective psyche is on edge. Youre nervous; Im nervous; were all very frazzled. Recession will just tip us over. The Obama jobs package, even if its passed in small parts, would go a long way to ensuring that we dont go back into recession and that bright economic future actually will be upon us I think sooner than we realize. Thank you.

My view about this is, if we do not make long-term structural returns and make them soon, the stimulus program will not succeed. The most that you could get out of this is six or nine months. After that time, the long term structures will remain and you will fall into a recession that might be deeper than one that you take today. So what is it that you have to do? You have to try to figure out why it is that in the last 10 years it has been a lost decade in terms of economic growth. And the answer is not that the stimulus program does or does not work. It is because all on mid-level institutions are inferior to what they were at an earlier time. The labor markets have become much more regulated. The banking industry has become much more concentrated at this particular point. Dodd-Frank will introduce all sorts of layers of confusion. The health care bill is a huge drain with respect to potential resources because the unemployment uncertainty is associated with the mandate and everything else are in fact going to wield a very heavy load on this system. The question is when will this load be bourn? The answer is it will be bourn today. There is no way in effect that you can change the situation in the future if in fact you do not change the system correctly today. Employers and everybody else in this economy has rational expectations which dont only look at the short periods, they look at the long periods. So if we start talking about stimulus programs which have never worked, what happens is were just going to add another layer of uncertainty on top of the layer of regulation. And well be worse off than we are before. The question then is, will liberalization work? And the answer is if you engage in a systematic program of retrenchment and repeal, these things in fact will take effect immediately and you will start to see some kind of reversal. We do have a serious problem. We must do something. But if we think of the economy as being somebody with a diabetic shock, we ought not to add fix it, add to it some sugar.

The motion "Congress should pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece," and here to summarize her position in support of the motion, Cecilia Rouse, professor of economics at Princeton University.
Congress should pass Obamas jobs act - piece by piece|i2Debates/obama-jobs-act.p|280|R4|CECILIA ROUSE|for|0|25|12|0|0|24|0|45|0|0|5|3|65|18|0|6|13|0|0|0|0|233|6|0|2|1|0|6|18|0|1|12|26|0|7|11|8|1|0|3|8|3|9|21|45|45|57|6|40|0|1|1|0|0|24|18|0|4|0|7|65|9|6|1|26|375|So I do believe that Congress should pass the Obama jobs plan. I too am concerned about the impact of employer mandates on labor markets and believe we should be very judicious in looking at regulation. I think we should only put into place regulations where the benefits clearly exceed the costs. I think the evidence isn't really there that minimum wage is such an egregious regulation. But that would be another debate. However, if the Clinton administration in the Clinton years were such an example of economic freedom, in 2001, we had a recession where we had a jobless recovery. So what happened? Did the regulatory environment magically change with an election? I think that what we have is -- what that tells us is that this regulatory environment is not going to address the cyclical changes. And I think we have a cyclical challenge right now. And so I think it's appropriate for the Congress to step in. Now, as I said from the outset, I think one of the most important pieces of this is one that's a tax relief for employees. I think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is very important as well. I just want to add to that that Congress has always extended these benefits during times of recession. And the reason is clear. It's pennywise and pound foolish not to do so. If workers and their families aren't supported, they're going to end up on other government programs. And so Congress -- even Reagan did not stop supporting unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent. So I think Congress typically steps in during times of recession. I think there are good economic reasons for it to do so. And I think this is one of those times. More importantly, you know, as Mark has said very carefully, we really do risk falling into another recession which will be just devastating for all of us. Might doing nothing make a difference? It might work. But I've got to tell you, I'm not a gambling girl, and I'm just not willing to make that gamble for 42 million workers who are out of work and the millions more who are really suffering economically. Thank you.

Thank you all for braving the weather to come and for joining us tonight. You know I do have in addition to my role on Intelligence Squared a day job and its running an insurance company which gets around two percent of its premiums from medical insurance. So this debate is not very material to our business but I thought I should share that fact with you in the interest of full disclosure. You know, I also want to share some of my own insurance expertise as it relates to tonights motion. What seems clear to me is that healthcare costs are out of control. They amount to around 16 percent of the U.S. economy compared to nine percent in other rich countries. Health costs have been a major drag on employment and growth and have jeopardized the financial position of the federal government, state governments and frankly we have no better health outcomes to show for these costs. In considering the arguments of our panelists tonight, you might want to think about the effect of this bill on costs. There is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to address Medicare costs in particular. After all, some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in America are incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life. Some Republicans, by the way, have been quite disingenuous about this, raising the specter of death panels and World War II vets languishing without appropriate care. But another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers, medical malpractice insurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that they foster. Democrats, traditional allies of the tort bar, have hardly been forthright about this aspect of the situation. Another factor is that consumers of health care generally have little incentive to control costs. Why should they economize if insurance companies are paying? Most insurance covers things you cant budget. Car insurance doesnt cover oil changes. Home owners insurance doesnt cover a soiled rug. But when it comes to health insurance, we expect coverage of every conceivable medical benefit. Most insurance policies are priced to reflect risk. Teenagers pay more for auto insurance. Smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth. But for health coverage, most states have mandated that everyone in the community pays the same. What this means is that healthy young people pay excessive premiums they cant well afford in order to subsidize their better-off but more illness prone elders. They often quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage. This bill would force them to do so. But whether requiring someone to purchase something they dont want is even constitutional will surely be touched on in tonights debate. So in considering the arguments youll hear this evening, I encourage you to listen with the following kinds of questions in mind. Does the bill address unproductive and undignified end-of-life care? Does it rein in tort lawyers to discourage defensive medicine? Does it encourage us as consumers to care about what we spend? Does it provide appropriate incentives for healthy life styles and preventive care? These are not rhetorical questions. But theyre very complex just like the bill were discussing. We have a stellar roster of panelists to help illuminate these issues and its now my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Robert. And I would just like another round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz. Two words, Repeal Obamacare, that is our motion. That is what we are here to debate. Im John Donvan of ABC News at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University and on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation for another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Repeal Obamacare, and to debate this motion we have a congressman, presidential advisers, and a man who has written more about the topic than anybody, I think we can say literally. And in this debate, we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience. You act as our judges. By the time this debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote two times, once before the debate and once again afterwards. And the team that has been most persuasive, that has changed most of your minds will be declared our winner. So let's go to our preliminary vote. Go to those key pads at the right hand side of your seat. Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare. " And if you agree with this motion, push number one. If you're for repeal, it's number one. If you disagree, it you are against repeal, it's number two. If you are undecided, it's number three. And if you feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote.

We're locking out the system, and we will present the results of both votes at the end of the debate. So on to round one. Our motion is it "Repeal Obamacare. " And first, to argue for this motion, for repeal, I'd like to introduce John Shadegg, a congressman from Arizona. Let me say, former congressman. After eight terms, John Shadegg decided to step away from the job which is not something that a lot of people in your position -- actually, he tried twice. The first time -- the first time your fellow Republicans asked you not to leave.

And thank you to the audience. You play a key role here tonight. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate. And I want to recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world on this topic. And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain. My partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers. And I believe he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps more importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability. Let me begin, however, by refuting two arguments. First, supporters of Obamacare will say that Republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo. That is simply wrong. I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare reform bills than any other member of Congress. I wrote a number of patients rights bills in the early debate. But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on. And you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare. Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government money. And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money. Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded. But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense. Obamacare insures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid. That will increase costs. It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and bureaus. That's got to increase costs. And it extends dramatic new mandates over health insurance in America. And that will increase costs. Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand. The current system is in fact broken. As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fix it. Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly. There are too many uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get affordable coverage. I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has -- who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition. One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible. It's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free. It costs them no taxes and you no taxes. But it punishes those without employee-provided care. Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it a third more expensive. That is simply outrageous and indefensible. And stunningly, Obamacare does not fix that problem. Obamacare is simply the wrong answer. First, it addresses symptoms, namely the uninsured, which are too high. But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost. Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your premiums. And the experts agree on that point. It moves -- and perhaps this is most important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding. But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me. It gives them to the government. What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people. Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions. Republican proposals in Congress do exactly that. Why? Because if the health insurance is yours, not your employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you. You can make the changes. You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked. You can force the insurance companies to compete, which they don't do now. You can hire the plan of your choice. And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you. Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up. By its terms, Obamacare institutes lots of mandates. One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned down. That will increase cost. One is modified community rating. That will increase costs. And a third is an array of new benefit mandates. All of those will increase costs. Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically. In Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average. Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises. The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Not true. He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it. You can keep him or her. Not true. And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve down. None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true. The Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage. Leading experts say few plans will actually survive. How could they survive? They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written. In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it. They will lose their healthcare. AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care and pay the fine. John Deere will lose $150 million a year. Caterpillar, $100 million a year. 3M, $90 million a year. The numbers go on and on. Those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care. They'll be forced. And think about their workers. Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor. We simply have to do better than that. The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code is now. It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange. And if you join the exchange, you can get a government subsidy. But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot join the exchange. That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care.

We should uphold the Affordable Care Act because it is morally the right thing to do and it is in our common interest. And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the 1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population. By the early '90s, it was up to 37 million. Now it's reached 50 million. And if we were to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated, the number will go higher. Fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose everything they have because of illness. For years surveys have shown that anxiety about not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans' anxieties. And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost. Still, the majority of Americans, and I guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of those who already have protection. The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted effort to do that. It extends coverage in two ways, by expanding Medicaid for poor people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no more than eight percent of income. Now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept. Massachusetts has a working exchange, The Health Connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties. If you move to Massachusetts, you can use The Connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle. No wonder brokers dont like the idea of the insurance exchange but we dont kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel agents, do we? And currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants, 30 cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and marketing costs. The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the system. In regard to coverage, the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts reforms. It does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance. The origins of this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals, to a plan that Richard Nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee, with 20 Republican cosponsors, back in 1981 -- 1991, a bill by the way that had an individual mandate in it. And substantively, the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation. We just dont happen to live in a bipartisan political era. Consider the law's moderate responsible approach to financing. The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand coverage from within the healthcare system. We spend enough on healthcare, we just dont allocate it well. Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers, and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments, and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans. The law also imposes a tax on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCains Health Policy Advisor. Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will explode the deficit, even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit. Now, Jon is my partner in this. Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost. But while you're listening to the other side, please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at a $3.1 trillion surplus back then. And Bush came in, cut taxes, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no financing, sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit exploded. It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the great recession. What happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between 2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress? What did they do about health care costs? Here are the facts. Family health insurance premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a decline of three percent in real median household income. Faced with a potential death spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed healthcare reform in the past, the American Medical Association, the hospitals, the for- profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be changed. And thats why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it. Now just a word on Mr. Shadeggs proposals. We have low-regulation states, states that dont regulate the insurance industry. His own state of Arizona is one of those states and their costs are just as high as elsewhere. Arizona has 20 percent uninsured. The high deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and other Republicans favor and put into law havent shown any sign of reducing costs or extending coverage. They are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if youre in a high tax bracket, its great to have a health savings account. You can put money in the account, dont even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after age 65 without penalty. So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy and well-off. They just dont happen to do much for the low-income workers and the others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare.

Thank you very much. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. Im John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting it out over this motion, Repeal Obamacare. You have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third. To argue for the motion, to argue for the repeal of Obamacare, Id like to introduce Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is president of the American Action Forum. He was with the McCain campaign as an adviser and in his critiques of the Obama health plan, came up with the telling phrase, fantasy in, fantasy out. I believe thats yours. You own that. You also --

You know, Im going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, youve all realized that what were debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform. My own history, Johns history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of which Im unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States. Real healthcare reform has two pieces. Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare. In the end, an insurance system takes the nations health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to. The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall healthcare bill. And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get. At one-sixth of our economy, its one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine. And the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades. If you look at income per person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades. Republicans, Democrats alike. It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums. And if you don't control costs, you cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about. I favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform. It does not deal with the cost problem. Now, I don't need to say so. Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so. The Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections. Did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this? No, it does not. You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of Medicare, not make it more solid. You can ask Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare. He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded. And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, This isn't about cost reform. This is health insurance reform. There's nothing in it. Much like Massachusetts, it's just about covering people. It doesn't control costs. And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform, Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average. And after reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform. So we need to get the healthcare reform. And without that, we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation. Now, I'm a former CBO director. It is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future. I'll spare you the numbers tonight because I like you more than my children. But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward -- forget re-litigating the past. Mr. Starr is good at that. But looking forward in the administrations budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after were soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is back at five percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars. Nine hundred billion of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing. We are headed to that magical position where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. Along the road, we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation. We will no longer be a top- rated borrower. This act makes that situation worse, not better. It says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent. Revenue's not going to grow at eight percent. The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors and gimmicks. And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score. If you give them handcuffs, they'll come up with any answer that you might want. So we can't afford this as a nation. It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs. It's not really healthcare reform. You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare. One sixth of our economy is underperforming. If we care about economic performance, we should repeal Obamacare. Forget the mandates, forget the taxes. We had a system that was broken to begin with. One-sixth of our economy is broken. Why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it? But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues of fairness. Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed. There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000. One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income. The other's going to get zip. That is grotesquely unfair. And if any future Congress acts pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond. They'll give everybody the money. And my first problem will blow up even worse. Terrible idea. And for every young person in this audience, this is a disaster. Through the individual mandate you'll be obligated to be in the pool. The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you. And at the end of your life, you get to pick up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare. You'll get it at the front end. You'll get it at the back end. It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the United States Congress. Should be repealed on those grounds alone. There are other sort of detours along the way. The insurance companies, that's where all the costs come from. Oh, my God, there are administrative costs. There are profits. The top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion. That's a lot of money. I'd like to have it. The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion. So go for it. Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits. You get about a year and a half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were. This isn't about insurance companies. This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs. And the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our problems. Medicare pays doctors. It pays hospitals. It pays some insurance companies, and it pays drug companies. And it has silos to pay them all. And nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary. Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care. Nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve. We should fix that first. We should repeal this now. Thank you.

Our motion, "Repeal Obamacare" and our final speaker in opening statements to speak against the motion, Jonathan Cohn who is a senior editor at the New Republic. He wrote a book called Sick: The Untold Story of America's Healthcare Crisis, which in some ways explains his evolution from pure journalist into advocate with these scores and scores of stories of people in dire straits that he reported and is very passionate about. You also had a blog throughout the debate called The Treatment. And you signed off, after the legislation passed, saying, and I quote you, "The debate has ended. " So why are we here?

I want to thank the audience. I want to thank the foundation. I want to thank my opponents. I want to thank Doug Holtz-Eakin in particular for some of the comments he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control, we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire society. And you know, I agree with all of that. I do. Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard. Now, you listened to this team over here. You've listened to their argument. And they painted a very dire picture of a program out of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks. It's going to leave us all paying tons in insurance premiums. And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture because I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits of the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down, subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now. People like that. They think that is a good idea. So they focus on this cost question. And, you know, during the healthcare debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply not in the -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, I don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs , but I think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things. So I did two things here. First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs. And I want to specifically go through some of the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading. Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money? I mean isn't -- Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't? I don't think it's common sense. I look around the world. I look at countries like France and Germany and Switzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better, people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do. Now, is there something about the United States that we're not capable? We're not innovative enough? We can't do that? I don't think so. Certainly it is possible, certainly, to get excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money. So the question is, will this bill do it? And I believe it will. Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that. It has three basic approaches. One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste. A lot of it's corporate welfare. Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits through Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much. They're making too much in profits. So we say we're going to take some of that back. We're going to take back that corporate welfare. Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes. And we get money from there. Now, I don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan. Now, they may not like those ideas. And that's fine. And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare. Why the richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during the Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more. But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most important. And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system works. Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in our medical care system. Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different insurance companies. Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A doesn't know what Dr. B is doing to patient C. Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for treatments that don't work. The Obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attack those, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is not something crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the left and the right. It's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital infection. It's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of what patients are getting as they move through the medical system. It's about giving financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention, and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe will help control healthcare costs. Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said these numbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, common sense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional Budget Office. Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting. The CBO -- my reading of the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, "You know what? This bill will reduce the deficit. It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, it will reduce it by a lot more afterwards. " And by the way, the rate of growth in healthcare spending is going to start to slow down. Now, it is true that the CBO, you can say, "Well, the CBO ought to use these rules," or whatever. Well, what the CBO rules mean is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented, and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works. Douglas Holtz-Eakin says, "Well, that never works because we've never seen it happen. " Well, you know what? It's happened before. During the late 1990s we tried to control costs in Medicare and we did for a while. We passed very large cuts to Medicare during the Balanced Budget Act. It was the late 1990s, and you know what? Those cuts stuck, and we were able to reduce the growth of Medicare from where it wouldve been otherwise. Its entirely possible to do this. Now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program. As my colleague mentioned, during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they tried to approach healthcare in a different way. They said, All right, lets try a different approach, and lets have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it. Well, that did increase the deficit, and that is the sort of choice were talking about facing here. Now, my colleague -- my opponent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed, and he said, Well, John Gruber of MIT says this is not good, or he said, The CMS actuary said this. " Well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people -- the list of experts who have endorsed this, its not just the Congressional Budget Office, its people like David Cutler, a professor at Harvard University, who won the John Base Clark Medal for the most accomplished economist under 40. It's people like Jonathan Gruber from MIT -- I know he quoted Jonathan Gruber -- Jonathan Gruber has said many times he endorses this bill. He thinks it's our best shot right now to get healthcare costs under control. It's people like Mark McClellan, who hasn said that he believes the Affordable Care Act will start to reduce healthcare spending, and why do we care about Mark McClellan? Because Mark McClellan ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and its people like the Simpson-Bowles Commission, the bipartisan fiscal commission said, "The cost control in the Affordable Care Act will be affected, and we need if anything to double down on it. " This is not my opinion, its not some crazy opinion, it is in fact the opinion of the best experts of left and right.

So, now, on to round two where the debaters can address one another directly, and also take questions from me and you in the audience.

All right. We're locking out the system, and we will present the results of both votes at the end of the debate. So on to round one. Our motion is it "Repeal Obamacare. " And first, to argue for this motion, for repeal, I'd like to introduce John Shadegg, a congressman from Arizona. Let me say, former congressman. After eight terms, John Shadegg decided to step away from the job which is not something that a lot of people in your position -- actually, he tried twice. The first time -- the first time your fellow Republicans asked you not to leave.

Im John Donvan of ABC News at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University and on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation for another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Repeal Obamacare, and to debate this motion we have a congressman, presidential advisers, and a man who has written more about the topic than anybody, I think we can say literally. And in this debate, we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience. You act as our judges.

" We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. We have two teams of debaters, two against two, who are arguing over this motion, "Repeal Obamacare. " On one side, a former Congressman and former aide to John McCain are arguing that the plan passed by the Obama administration is going to blow up financially and will hurt America and is headed for the dust bin. Arguing against them, a former advisor to the Clinton administration and a journalist who has written extensively about healthcare, arguing that this act -- that this law should be preserved, and not only preserved, but built upon. I want to ask a question about philosophy. Both sides agree that the system weve lived with for the last 30 years, particularly in its last 15 or 20 years, is broken. You agree that something needs to be done. You're arguing over the solutions. Your opposition on one side to the presidents program and youre supporting the other side says what fundamentally about what you think we are as a nation, as Americans. I want to put that question first to you, John Shadegg, former congressman.

I think were already -- were a nation that does support taking care of those who cant care for themselves. Were a nation -- and my legislation covers every single American -- were a nation that thinks its outrageous that anybody would lose coverage because there are pre-existing condition like my heart condition or my sisters breast cancer. But were also a nation that honors limited government and honors individual choice. I think on the one hand what you hear from the other side is that the government can manage this issue better. And what I would suggest to you is we are in this problem because the government made changes that took you and I out of the equation. The government said health insurance is available only if your employer buys it and you get a tax deduction. But if you go out and buy it, its one-third more expensive. If you cant hire and fire somebodys who delivering a service to you, you cant hold it accountable including its costs.

And it is, I think, a sad commentary on us that we remain the only advanced country that doesnt provide protection to all of our citizens. Now the reason that we have -- lets go back to why we have this employer-based system. If you dont have government share, spread the costs of healthcare, there needs to be some organization that serves as the pool for risk. And the employer is the most convenient way to do it. Thats actually why this first developed in the 1930s and 40s before we had the tax advantages. Its simply going to default from the government to employers. Its not as though the government took this away from individuals. That individual market that the Congressman loves is phenomenally inefficient.

I do not favor individual purchase. That was the attack made against Senator McCain throughout the campaign and it was absolutely unfair. I favor a plan which says I as an individual can buy an individual plan, I can take my employers plan or I can buy from a whole group of expanded choices. We could have my social club. The Kiwanis Club can offer a plan. My university alumni can offer a plan. Give me that choice, force those insurance companies to compete. They dont compete right now. They dont care what you and I pay for health insurance and they dont, quite frankly, care whether it treats us well. They only care that our employer bought the plan.

Choice is a wonderful thing. We want to give choice. People who buy, I mean, we need to realize that the employer -- people who are getting private insurance are now divided into two groups. There are people who get it from their employers and there are people who buy it on their own. Neither of them has choices right now. Youre buying insurance on your own? Good luck buying a coverage policy. Youre going to have trouble finding one, particularly if you have pre-existing conditions.

This Affordable Care Plan, what it does is it says, all right, lets create a market, a real market, a place -- kind of like Expedia, like they have in Massachusetts now where everybody whos buying one actually gets a choice of insurance programs, a set of plans that they know they can afford that will be made available to them regardless if theyre a cancer survivor and let all of those people shop. Meanwhile, employers who have insurance for their employees will continue to provide that. Look, at some point it is very easy to say we want to open up exchanges for everybody and let everybody shop. You can build on this system to do that. You can do that. But youre never going to get to that system youre talking about. You will never get to a system where people have choice and a choice of actual plans that are available to everybody, that cover what they need, until you build these exchanges that are in the affordable care act.

Let me just -- I would never speak for 300 million Americans. And that's one of the beautiful things about this country. And I think the -- you know, I agree, obviously, with a lot of what Jon has said. Go back to the beginning of the evening when we were asked to think about end of life care. Now, do you really think that Americans want an insurance company making decisions about the end of life care? No. They've already seen that model and rejected it --

They told us, Ill read that evidence. I don't think they want the government making those decisions. I think we know who makes those decisions. It's the family. It's -- those are the only people who are ethically well situated to make those tough calls. And so we must, in the end, invest in families, the authority to make decisions, invest in them, their insurance. Invest in them the information and the ability to make those decisions and center this system around families and Americans, not around these large government entities. What does that mean in practice? I'm an economist. I mean, economists are practical people. You follow your nose and incentives. If I have an insurance policy when I'm 21, and then I develop an odd thing where I have to have my kidneys transplanted, I'm still on that insurance policy. Any insurance company now has to recognize they've got me for life. It's not a one-year sign-up proposition where they can minimize on preventive care or they can try to cut off covering some things. They have to deal with the right lifetime incentives. Pay for the cheap prevention up front. A lot of them eventually want to do that. And align the insurance and the medical incentives to transform the way we deliver medicine in America. That's what we need. And in the process, guess what? My insurance goes with me from job to job, job to home when I stayed home with my kids. You don't have to spend the whole time fighting over who works full time to get the insurance. It's madness. Americans are rearranging their lives for the insurance. Let's rearrange the insurance so it fits American lives. That's what this system will be.

I support exchanges. I support -- I always support good competitive markets. And you can build exchanges that enhance competition left to do that. There is a lot in the bill that is bipartisan. It's in the delivery system reforms, not in the coverage expansions which are madness. But they're all tiny. They're pilots. Pilots have a terrible track record of actually turning into real policy. In fact the road to healthcare hell is paved with pilots and demonstrations. And that's a pilot and a demonstration for a known problem. If you've got a problem, fix it. The problem with this bill, it doesn't fix what we know is the issue, healthcare costs. Instead, it's got a bunch of pilots that Congress will never actually implement. And it doesn't fix the biggest source of our problem, which is the Medicare system which pays for fragmentation, pays for overuse. It's a fee for service system. We have more problems created by those programs than this could ever solve.

There is one plan prescribed by the government, actually has three different components, but that's it. Three. Secretary Sebelius can grant exemptions. She already has too many companies. She has the ability to impose new benefit mandates. She has ability to say what premium increase is effective or not effective. The notion that this bill gives the average American more choice is ridiculous. It's going to take away the choices Americans have now, and it's going to force them into essentially a one-size-fits-all plan. When you say, for example, to employers, that your costs are going to up, such as AT&T, to the tune where you could pay the fine for not insuring every one of your employees and still save $2 billion, they're going to have no choice but to drop their coverage and put people into the government- run plan.

Healthcare is very different from other kinds of services and commodities. Seventy percent of the healthcare costs in any year are concentrated in 10 percent of the people. So insurance companies have a very strong incentive to cherry pick, to go out and to look for the 50 percent of people who actually account for only three percent of the costs. And when you have this market where supposedly everybody has individual choices, you also have a market where the insurance companies are going to cherry pick and avoid the sick people. They will do everything in their -- it is the best business model for them. Rather than try to control healthcare costs, it's just to avoid sick people. The way the exchanges work is that if you want to sell insurance in the exchange, you have to agree to take anybody. Thats the bargain. And what the exchange does, so the people pay in on a community rated basis, but the insurance companies get paid according to the risk of the population they enroll. So if they enroll an older population, if they enroll a sicker population, they get paid more. Thats what goes on through the exchange that wont go on through this market. I realize this is complicated. Insurance is a complicated business, and this law is trying to take account of the way this business characteristically malfunctions. Thats why we end up with millions of people uninsured.

You may enroll in that plan if you are either denied coverage altogether or if your coverage is priced at, well say, 20 percent, or 30 percent, or more above the average cost, because you have a preexisting condition. Once you enroll in the high risk pool, your health is covered comprehensively including my sister's breast cancer or my heart condition, and the -- so that means that the cost of insuring that pool is higher than the cost of insuring any other pool. Thats a high risk pool. The costs of insuring that group are then subsidized either by dividing it equally, the extra costs amongst every insurance company in the jurisdiction, it could be the state or it could be federal, or by general revenues from the state, often done by sin taxes. I happen to know that because its already the law in 22 different states.

Look, one of the reasons that there is a mandate in this law is precisely to avoid the possibility that people will refuse to buy insurance until they get sick. Thats the whole rationale for the mandate. Now Ive actually proposed another way to accomplish the same purpose because the mandate is the single most unpopular part of the bill. People dont understand that the mandate is directly related to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusion. You cant eliminate those exclusions just for the reasons you said unless you have some way to get the people into the pool. My alternative is the following. If you want to opt out, if you dont want to be part of the system, okay, you can do that without penalty. But you have to sign a form saying I wont come back and I cannot come back in. For five years, I cant use the exchanges, I cant get the subsidies, I cant get a policy without the pre-existing conditions. So I understand your position completely. We need to be able to avoid the possibility that people will behave opportunistically.

Im not an expert on it myself. But I know it comes up in Congress quite frequently. It causes a stir. I think it somehow drives pay outs to doctors who see Medicare patients.

If you want to know why this doesnt reduce the deficit, they left out $300 billion worth of costs. And the CBO doesnt have the option of saying hey, you left that out.

You're hearing a very interesting version of the history of the '90s and healthcare. The doctor fix was built into our budgets for the government long before healthcare reform came on the scene. It is something that needs to be fixed separately. It would have to be fixed separately if we never had Obamacare. It is a separate cost.

But the questioner used a phrase which probably went by a lot of people. He talked about physician-induced demand or provider-induced demand. So this is another aspect of how healthcare is different. Normally, when you are the customer, you make decisions about what to buy. But when you're a patient, particularly when you're very sick, you're in the hospital, other people are making decisions. They're prescribing drugs, procedures and so forth. And if you're really sick, and most of the big costs are generated for people who are very ill, it's not -- the demand isn't coming from you. It's coming from the supplier. This is a very bizarre system.

Number one, there are no perfect markets. And to somehow compare health markets against perfection misses the point. All markets are, at some level, imperfect and have anomalies of the same type. The solution to this is to better inform -- hang on. Let me finish. Let me finish. The important thing here is to have reforms which Republicans include as well as the -- your arguments, to better inform patients so they can distinguish between valuable and invaluable treatments. And we have a system riddled with low-value care. And all of the reforms Republicans propose address that issue. An important thing to recognize, the reason I'm deeply opposed to this bill is, it is fundamentally -- there are pages attached to all the issues. But it is fundamentally a coverage bill. And if you look at half the expansions, they are in Medicaid. Sixteen million Americans we've put into Medicaid. Medicaid's a terrible system. Fifty percent of providers will not see Medicaid patients. Medicaid patients are twice as likely to show up at the ER for regular medical care than are the uninsured. And it is a great joke to give someone an insurance policy called Medicaid and not let them actually see a physician.

And interestingly, they found that the highest place for healthcare costs in America is a little town called McAllen, Texas. And they went to McAllen, Texas, and tried to find out why are costs so high. And what they found was a couple of different factors. Number one, they found that doctors in fact do prescribe lots of procedures that are unnecessary. And they do so in McAllen, Texas. They noted that, for example, great healthcare centers do not prescribe that many procedures. And so they figured out there needed to be a way. They actually began interviewing doctors. And they said, you know what? In the current system, we are not incentivized to control costs. Why are they not incentivized to control costs? Because nobody's watching the store. The reality is --

And I think most people who study the healthcare system agree that, you know, one of the weird things about our healthcare system is you have these bizarre regional variations. So you go to some parts of the country, and they're doing all kinds of extra procedures, and other parts of the country, they're not. And why is that? Well, the people who wrote this bill, they all read that article. They all know this. And the article actually built on years and years of studies showing that and its very specifically designed to help address that problem. And there're all kinds of ways it does. I mean, it would be -- I would love to be able to sit here and say, here is the silver bullet that will change it. Because that's what he thinks.

An early mentor said to me if the financial analysis defies common sense, go with common sense. So now we get 35 million new people coming into Medicaid. We've got baby boomers retiring in droves going into the Medicare program. And we've got all that intercepting with all advancements in care and treatments, procedures and drugs which extend life and make life more livable. And a big underpinning, a big way that the Obama bill is going to get this under control is by slowing the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. I believe the number is about --

Well, we've done reductions in Medicare like this before. We've done reductions larger than the ones we've done before. And by the way, during the McCain campaign, Mr. Holtz- Eakin, I remember, very vividly, saying that they were going to pay for their healthcare plan by enacting Medicare cuts that were even larger. Now, I don't think he was trying to deprive Medicare patients of access. But the fact is we've had these cuts before. And every time it happens, you hear a lot of predictions, oh, my God, people are going to stop seeing Medicare patients. And I understand that. Look, my father is a surgeon. He's in south Florida where you see people walking around with little dollar signs because there are cataract surgeries and, you know, that's what it's like. And I understand that. The fact is, every single time that we have done this, there have been predictions that doctors are going to flee the system. And you'll always get the anecdotal, of course, this doctor is leaving that -- but the Medicare payment advisory committee looks at this. There's a government, independent, not partisan authority that looks at these statistics to monitor this, because they want to make sure that's not happening. There's a group called the Center for the Study of Healthcare System Change, which is the longest acronym ever for a think tank. But believe me, they're very reliable, totally nonpartisan. Everyone trusts -- And what they all found is it never happens. The doctors have not left the system.

I've been there. And prospectively, the MedPAC as well as the CMS actuary would say that the kinds of cuts and vision for Medicare will either lead to inadequate care, inability to see providers, or you can go put the money back in. So there are no real changes in the business model that would allow a physician to practice more cheaply in Medicare, and that is why we should have fixed the problem instead of written the checks that is this system. I think that is the fundamental indictment, we are not fixing the problem, and it is important to recognize that although there's all these bells and whistles that Jonathan likes to point to, there are lots of pages, they don't have any teeth. They put something in called the "Independent Payment Advisory Board," that's like MedPAC on steroids, and -- but the law says they can't make beneficiaries pay more, they can't touch the hospitals and the nursing homes for 10 years, they can't mess with the way the docs get paid, so where's the big change in the way the delivery system's going to happen?

Medicare beneficiaries will get preventive services that have never been covered before. Those are some of the terrible mandates for private insurance thats going to have to cover vaccinations, things like that. But, you know, Im not counting on that for big savings.

I take the human side of this argument very, very seriously. When we were kids growing up, our parents bought indemnity plans, and the doctors cared about us because there was a physician-patient relationship. We put the cash on their table. The system we have created now divorces us completely from our doctor. It says your doctor isnt hired by you, your doctor is hired by a plan who was hired by your employer. And that is what has caused medicine to -- caused damage to the physician-patient relationship, its caused a loss of control in costs, and it has caused the kind of devastation that youre talking about. I know people that cant afford care because the insurance companies dont give a damn about what it cares. Its time to stop shoveling money to them and put the power and control in your hands, not to give it to the government so Secretary Sebelius could write a thousand new regulations.

Absolutely, and that is why I support this bill and dont think we should repeal it. I mean, remember right now your insurance company says you cant get that treatment, youre stuck. Right now youre moving between insurance companies -- You know, you're -- right now you're moving between insurance company and insurance company, you change plans and tomorrow you have to change doctors because theyre not in the same network. This plan allows people to stay on the same insurance plan longer and when that denial comes down, guess what? You can appeal it. What a notion. You can actually go to an impartial person and say You know what? Theyre saying I cant get this premium because they think its too expensive. I think I have the medical evidence that it works, and the board says, You know what? Youre right. Thats a mandate. Thats a regulation, and you know what? It helps people.

And when your fathers dying of prostate cancer theyre going to choose to not give four months of very expensive treatment and thus lower cost.

This is what I would say to you. Healthcare is not a one thing. Its not just the circumstances tragic and threatening as you described. Healthcare and where we spend this is an enormous range that involves elective procedures, it involves chronic conditions, it involves traumatic injury and we have a system that does not provide individuals with anything like the ability to manage their care, anything like information needed to choose from high and low value care and never gets them in a preventive way in a position to avoid being stuck with a tragic choice. Thats wrong. We need a system that they control all aspects of their life cycle up to those very moments. And I have a great faith in the ability of the American people. They do it in every other aspect of their lives some of which are enormous, they have kids. Thats a pretty life and death situation.

How really out of touch it is with the conditions of illness. How, in fact, it assumes a kind of marketplace where, for example, prices would be available. Actually, you cant find out what the prices are for different things. And in fact a hospital has 12 different prices for the same thing depending on who its treating. We dont have a system of posted prices in healthcare. Now, maybe you want to change all that. Maybe you want to transform it but you were in power for years and you didnt do anything about it.

The decision point that you referred to, once theyve gotten sick, is not the right one. The reality is people are economic beings and they do make economic decisions. Indeed, I proposed a bill in the United States Congress that would allow you if you live in New Jersey to buy a plan that was written and offered for sale in Arizona or Idaho or Illinois or Connecticut. No, no. Let me explain how it works. You could buy that policy -- and the reason I wrote that bill is because the people in New Jersey today pay at least four times more than the people in Pennsylvania because of those strictures [spelled phonetically] of the law in New Jersey. Indeed, Americans who go to New Jersey are going to their friends that live in Pennsylvania and say, What are you paying? And theyre saying Well, Im paying one-fourth of what youre paying. And people are actually buying health insurance by pretending they live in Pennsylvania when they really live in New Jersey because it costs one-fourth as much. Now we heard the argument that nobody would shop but people really do shop. But heres why shopping -- ah -- if they can shop -- what makes me maddest about all of this- -

People are not going to pay, are not going to choose to pay cheaper premiums unless they have to. What theyre going to do is pay, theyre going to spend as much as they can on healthcare and get the best product they can. They wont choose to buy a cheap policy, some may, but most people buy the most expensive policy they can. In fact, that was a study done on my bill allowing across state line health insurance sales and indeed, no less than the Department of Health and Human Services said if you simply allowed cross state sales of health insurance we would have eight million fewer people uninsured in America today. Now, here's the point. It's not -- the key isn't that you will be able to get a cheaper policy. The problem is the insurance companies are cheating us right now. They're charging too much because they don't have to compete.

Hi. I know we're here to discuss to repeal or not to repeal. But that is not the question. I think the central question should be -- and it is also my question to you, what is our path to a truly universal, affordable healthcare system? Because whether we have the Affordable Care Act or whether we have the status quo, both systems are asking us to put our faith in the private health insurance industry which is profit driven. And life and death matters should not be decided by the profit motive. So that what is the path -- What is the path to an improved Medicare system open to all?

But the alternative, a monopoly that you have to deal with, is completely inferior to having a vibrant insurance industry that has to compete for your business. I would much rather force them to give me a decent service than have a mandate that I have to use the one that's supplied by the government. The second thing is, remember, for those advocates of a single big national payer, a national payer cannot negotiate any better between one hospital in Wichita and another hospital in Wichita which is ultimately where you have to negotiate who can provide this care at the cheapest price. They can't do it any better than the guy in Wichita. So there is literally no advantage to a national plan. It's a charade.

Each day it's opposed by somewhere closer to 60 percent of the people. There is no poll out there yet that says that it's favored by more people than not. But more importantly than that -- and this is a key point -- when a nation that is a democracy makes a radical change in public policy, it should be reflected not by the narrowest of consensus but by a very broad consensus. When Social Security was adopted, more than 80 percent of the members of the Congress, House and Senate, voted for the creation of Social Security. When Medicare and Medicare were created, more than 70 percent of the members of Congress supported those programs. When SCHIP was adopted, again, the numbers were well over 75 percent of the members of Congress.

Very quickly, the polls -- if you scratch those polls even a little bit, what you will find is that it's a country overall. Do you like the healthcare reform? Yes, no, about divided. Ask the people who don't like it, do you think it should be repealed and just we should go back to the way we were, or make it stronger? About half the people break off, say, Oh, no, we want it to be stronger. And if you test the individual elements, they're wildly popular-- protection against pre-existing conditions, getting kids under 25 on parents insurance. All of these things are wildly popular. And yes, it's true, the Republican Party did not -- this was a closed vote. You know why that is? It's because we live in a world not like the one 20, 30 years ago, where you had a responsible Republican party, where you had moderate Republicans --

You know, I'm sorry. I take offense at that. I have offered healthcare reform bills every year I've been in Congress. There are many. I'm sorry the woman over there didn't hear them. Yes, Republicans passed the opportunity when they hold both majorities of Congress. But quite frankly, we did not have the demand that we have now seen. But how do you defend the fact that broad consensus is necessary to support this legislation? Have you defended it other than to say -- other than to say, well, back then, the Republican Party was responsible, and now it's not. That's really -- quite frankly, in the context of what happened last week, inappropriate.

Two months ago, the editor of an Austrian newspaper, a conservative, by the way, asked me how Americans could possibly oppose giving health insurance to the millions who don't have it. To Europeans across the political spectrum, it's unthinkable to withhold health insurance, just as we would regard it as unthinkable to deny an education to children. The Austrians, the French, the Germans, who have excellent medical care, don't become uninsurable when they get ill. They don't get locked into a job for fear of losing health coverage. Universal coverage makes it more secure, and it actually makes them more free. But every time the issue of universal coverage has arisen here, the opponents have used innuendo and fear to defeat health reforms that are common to every other advanced democracy. And last year, we finally broke through that drum beat of fear with moderate legislation and to creating a more just and efficient system to cover the excluded and create mechanisms to slow the growth in costs. Repealing the law would mean denying coverage to more than 30 million people. It would mean repealing the laws' protections against abusive insurance practices, some of which have already gone into effect like barring the rescission of policies just because the subscriber gets sick. It would mean giving up a whole series of cost-containment measures that show a lot of promise for reign in medical inflation. But even more importantly, repeal would be a concession of political helplessness in the face of a problem that has nagged at the national conscience for a century. It would be a confession that we simply are not capable of the elementary decency toward the sick that characterizes every other advanced democracy. There are surely changes that should be made in the law. And it can be made. But it would be an unspeakable tragedy for millions of people if we were to repeal it.

Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare. " And here to speak for the motion, for repeal, John Shadegg, former eight-term Congressman from Arizona and a Senior Fellow at the Goldwater Institute.
Repeal Obamacare|i2Debates/obamacare.p|272|R4|JOHN SHADEGG|for|4|9|14|0|0|20|0|53|5|2|7|3|61|20|0|4|9|0|1|1|0|234|6|0|0|2|0|3|25|0|0|3|34|0|12|3|7|5|0|2|1|1|7|34|42|57|71|8|30|0|4|0|0|0|55|18|0|3|11|8|66|7|8|8|28|395|The current system is broken. There is no question about it. It's broken because it costs too much, it's broken because there are too many people who don't have insurance, and it's tragically broken because some people are denied care because they have a chronic illness or preexisting condition. We need to address those problems, and there are lots of reforms that we can to address them. We can allow group pooling. We can force the insurance companies to become cost conscious and to have to compete with each other. We can give you control over your health insurance. We can move away from third party payer systems. And we can begin to redo the system. But we don't have to say that it's not universal care. Indeed, my legislation and other legislation that Republicans have offered provide universal coverage. My legislation says you give every single American a tax credit. For the poor, you give them a refundable tax credit, an amount of money. In the Coburn legislation and the Ryan legislation, you write specific dollar amounts for people to buy health insurance, and it's cash in their hands to go buy a coverage that they choose. So we achieve universal coverage, every single American. You can do universal enrollment as I described, where you're automatically enrolled in that process. We can deal with the problem of the uninsured without forcing a million Americans who like their current coverage to lose it, which is what Obamacare will do. You will force millions of Americans to lose the coverage they currently have and they currently like. And we can deal with the problem of preexisting conditions. I had heart bypass surgery. I have a preexisting condition. I care about this issue. I have an older sister -- my oldest sister, who has breast cancer. No one should be denied healthcare because they have a preexisting condition. But we can do that without forcing everybody out of the coverage they have now. But rather by creating high risk pools that are funded by all the other insurance companies or by government, and helping those who are in need because they have high risks. Americans will happily pay to support people who have that kind of condition because they dont know when they will have it next. High risk pools will work for those with preexisting conditions.

About 15 years ago I started interviewing people all over the country, and I met people who had their own firsthand experiences with the healthcare system, and I remember very, very vividly a man in upstate New York who had a good job, a good college education, was a defense contractor, he lost that job, he got the job back, but without benefits, and because of that, two years his wife who was ill did not get any medical visits, ended up she had cancer, it went undiagnosed, she died, and the family had to declare bankruptcy. For me, hearing that story and literally hundreds like it is where this all starts for me. This is a problem we have had in this country for a long time. It is a problem that keeps getting worse. Two years ago we had a presidential election. And we debated, what are we going to do about this? One, President Obama won, the Democrats got in and this was job number one. They reached out to the Republicans. They took ideas that Republicans had for years claimed as their own and said, "All right, well meet you halfway, and well try -- we will come up with a plan that builds on your ideas and our ideas and well work together. " And the Republicans walked away, and they said, "Fine. We have to go it alone, well go it alone. " But they kept the same ideas, they took the best from left and right, and what did they get? Its not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that will mean 30 million people have health insurance. It will mean that the insurance people have will be good insurance that will cover what they need. It will mean that people will have financial assistance. Congressman Shadegg never tells you this part of his plan, but the credit he would offer people isnt enough to pay for a good plan and people with pre-existing conditions, it would basically work out to second class insurance for second class people. This is the plan they're talking about. The cost control, not perfect, it could be better, fine, as Doug Holtz-Eakin, himself, said, these are the same ideas, we all agree on them, let's work together and double them down. But repeal Obamacare? Tom Harkin said, "This is a starter house, its got a good foundation, and its got room for expansion. " I say lets keep that foundation, lets build onto it, and lets not repeal Obamacare, lets not start over, lets go forward.

Those values are shared. What is at issue is what is the best way to go forward and to try to build on this foundation, one that is riddled with financial cancer and one that has only window dressing at attempting to deal with the real problems of the American healthcare system is a dangerous place to begin and it should be repealed in favor of a real future of the American healthcare system. Now, weve heard that somehow the Republicans got all their ideas and I believe that the vigorous debate tonight would stipulate thats not the case. This is not something on which we can build a future. This is a dangerous beginning. It does not fix the broken programs that are threatening the financial future of the United States. Medicare and Medicaid are not touched by this program. They are important pieces of the social welfare system in the United States. They deserved the attention of the healthcare reform. They were dismissed as unimportant. Instead we got a strategy to double down on those broken failures and try to write checks to paper over a broken system and in the process we are threatening the very future of this country, threatening the freedom and prosperity of Americans on which the healthcare system and everything else will be built. And we are most tragically doing it at the expense of our youngest and most vulnerable, our kids. They didnt get a vote. They arent going to be able to believe what we have done to them when they grow up. They will pay the bills now. They will pay the bills later. They wont see higher quality care. Theyll see more expensive care. And we will, in the process, take many of them into systems that ostensibly give them access but where no physician can treat them, no hospital will want them in their beds and they will not get good care and they will be broke to boot. Repeal Obamacare today.

Ever since there have been outbreaks of violence and an intermittent peace process has been carried on with the hope of resolving the conflicts. Very little tangible progress has been made, while Israeli settlements have altered the facts on the ground is Israels favor. On the other hand, the facts on the ground, in terms of world public opinion have moved decisively against Israel, not only in the Middle East, but in Europe, and perhaps in the U.S., as well. Against this back drop, the Palestinian authority is asking the UN for admission as a member state. A bit of background about the UN is helpful. The UN Security council includes five permanent members, the US, China, Russia, France, and the UK. Any one of these can veto the admission of Palestine. In contrast, the General Assembly, in which all members vote equally, can acknowledge Palestines status as a state, but only as a non member. Granting Palestine status as a member state would reinforce the UNs long standing resolutions in favor of a two state solution, express its disapproval of Israels settlements policy and the difficulties it has imposed on the lives of Palestinians living in the west bank. It would lend moral authority to the Palestinian cause, and might induce Israel to take a more conciliatory posture in negotiations. The US could exercise its veto power in the Security Council but at a cost in terms of our relations with the Arab world. And even a vote by the General Assembly to grant Palestine status as a non member state might give the Palestinians access to the International Criminal Court, where they could legally challenge the Israel occupation. On the other hand, nothing the UN can do will alter the facts on the ground. Nothing will resolve the dysfunctional, fragmented, conflict ridden, often corrupt, character of Palestinian attempts at self- government. Nothing will get the Palestinians to develop a coherent negotiating position, or to provide realistic assurances that agreements once reached would be enforced. Prior UN resolutions have endorsed the goal of Palestinian sovereignty. A UN admission of Palestine would be a redundant expression of hope, rather than a meaningful step toward peace. Debates about Israel and the Middle East are always heated. Tonights debate should generate light as well. We have an outstanding group of experts to illuminate these vexing issues, and its my pleasure to turn the evening over to our moderator, John Donvan.

We have two teams, four superbly qualified debaters, all of whom have lived at the heart of this argument. And it's an argument that, let's face it, in our lifetime, has seemed to be rather permanent, the way that the Berlin wall once seemed permanent, but turned out not to be, or apartheid in South Africa seemed permanent, but turned out not to be. But Israel and Palestine, this is the one that seems never to end. And why is that? Well, nothing helps expose the fault lines like a good debate. And debaters who are trying to make you understand their point of view and maybe get you to see something in a way that you have never seen it before. We go in three rounds of debate. Then the audience votes on the winning debate. Only one side wins. Our motion is "the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state. " And to meet our debaters, Mustafa Barghouthi, you are a Palestinian, a former presidential candidate in the Palestinian authority. You are a Nobel Peace Prize nominee because you lead a party that is adamantly devoted to peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation. And just very briefly, before we get started, what do you think is the point in this debate that your opponents don't understand yet, that you want to make them understand?

Your teammate, who is also arguing for admission, Daniel Levy. It's going to surprise some people that Daniel Levy arguing on this side is actually a citizen of the state of Israel. You were also a negotiator on the Israeli side in negotiations with Palestinians. And Daniel, from your point of view again, knowing that many of your fellow Israelis would oppose admission, what do you want the doubters to hear tonight?

Ladies and gentlemen, on October 10, 1971, the United Nations admitted the People's Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan. If that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight, I would not be standing here arguing in favor. What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century. Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight. We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, "Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood? " Law matters, but this is primarily a political, not a legal question. And it's not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution. It can be both, and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed. But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm. We do not have anyone here advocating a greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities. The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious. Approximately 600,000 Israelis, one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line. Settlements grow. Outposts are legalized. I invite you to go and see the reality. And it's not just a physical manifestation of blurring. It is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of Israelis live. Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states, but he has not walked the walk. His own Likud party platform opposes two states, and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing, then we got Balfour, then we got the '47 partition, then we got 78 percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we're not going anywhere. That's a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in New Hampshire tonight's part of that amen corner. Passivity cannot be the response. If we want two states, we have to act. And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment. We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation. Indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament. And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we're making it easier for Israeli society to change course. We are not. The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different. Do we really think that Israel is waiting to leave the territory, it's just waiting, and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough, and that's the key to unlock this? Let's acknowledge that it's not going to be easy but the current policies aren't helping. What, then, can be done? The Palestinians do actually have options, violence. I'm against that. That's illegitimate. They can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning. I can see its legitimacy, but I'm not an advocate of that. Or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay down a marker to get the attention of Israelis. That's what U.N. membership is, and I would argue it correlates with what is best, therefore, for Israel. We can't expect the Palestinians to wait forever, and we can't say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state. Suggesting the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it's also immoral. So if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can't impose a solution and if we can't even prevent deterioration, if we can't even get a settlement freeze, then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea? We vote to admit Palestine to the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight. U.N. membership is not a silver bullet. Its not a panacea. Its not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East. But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future. We will no doubt be told that this cant happen, that its meaningless symbolism, and especially not now with the Arab spring. Wrong. Yes, the U.S. has committed to a veto. No doubt, well discuss that. But does that make this debate pointless? Can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation? If thats the case, I strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning college football, because it wont be. And that can always be an argument. I urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than negotiations. Those negotiations are asymmetrical. One side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure. Negotiations cannot be the singular tool in our toolkit. And finally, if we are concerned about Israels security, then lets acknowledge that hope too is a security currently. Hopelessness encourages violence. There will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli. And perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy. Eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist. Not to dramatize, but if we dont have a Palestine, we are saying Kaddish. We are saying the right of prayer, of last prayer for Israeli democracy. I urge you to support this motion, to support the principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N. Thank you.

And thank all of you for coming. Daniel, Ive known you for many years. I admire your passion and your intellect. Youre a powerful advocate of Israeli-Palestinian peace, of logic and common sense. All of this, however, does not address the fundamental problem, the conundrum now, Daniel. Were dealing with a conundrum. We are stuck. Violence will never produce sovereignty for Palestinians, but neither will negotiations right now. So the question is what to do. What you are suggesting, in my judgment, is that we take an action that is not simply neutral, that will retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is. And Mustafa will agree. Dore may even agree. It is simply no justification for proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will not bring Palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty. I speak here not as an Israeli to you and not as a Palestinian. I speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an American, absorbed in this process for many years, 25 years. And during the course of that period, I developed a faith in three primary assumptions: Number one, there was a solution, equitable and durable; number two, negotiations were the only way to achieve it. And negotiations is flawed and its imperfect because its based on human frailty and weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise; and finally, that the United States had a critical role to play in this process by being fair, by being tough and by being reassuring -- all of these assumptions. Any honest man or woman would acknowledge . And the situation, youre quite correct, Dan, it will be worse. It will get worse before it gets worse. But the question still has to be addressed. How will granting the putative state of Palestine admission as a full-member state into the U.N. address any of this? Now, Im here to argue in six basic points. I dont want to bore you. Im not here to entertain you, but to leave you with perhaps a bakers dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why I believe this is a bad idea. And, by the way, I concede, particularly to you, Daniel, that I know bad ideas when I see them. I know illusions when I see them. I was responsible, over the course of a 20-year period, for quite a few, as Mustafa will attest, perhaps even Dore. But not tonight. I have no illusions tonight. First, as an American whose country sits on the Security Council, I cannot, in all good conscience, recommend the admission of a putative state however morally or ethically compelling it may be as a full member state. Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the man who has done more to build institutions of Palestinian statehood on the ground is against this proposition because he knows it'll undermine the work that he has done. It'll undermine the institutions. Palestine has no borders. It has no control over its population. It has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own society. In short, it does not control the guns, all of the guns in its society. I would argue that's critically important for statehood. Yes, much of this may be due to the Israeli occupation. But that doesn't change the reality. Admission of Palestine now will create a situation in which it cannot discharge its own obligations as a member state, in large part because half of its government, the rival Palestinian national movement doesn't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate conflicts. Mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of UN membership. Second, as an American, I'd oppose this because I believe it's not symbolic. It's not symbolic at all. It's a prescription, and an RX, if you will, for instability and perhaps even escalation. Think about it. We are admitting the Palestinian authority that presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities, one, the state of Israel, an ally of the United States, and the second factor and force, Hamas, an entity which is an adversary of the United States, has more control over what transpires in Palestine, this putative state than the Palestinian authority. That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence. Mustafa will tell you, and he may be right, that the basis for this negotiation, and the basis of -- for any Palestinian state will be June 4, '67 borders. But admitting Palestine into the UN will mean that a Palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to defend those borders. I wouldn't want -- I mean, maybe you see this as a blessing. I see it as a huge contradiction, to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has to defend borders that he cannot defend. And what is he to say to his public when the Israelis continue to do what they will do? Which brings me to my third point. There will be an Israeli reaction. And who is going to control that reaction? The United States? The international community? As Israel seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries, to basically say to the Palestinians, fine, you have now set your boundaries. June 4, '67, is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return to the table. But we're going to set ours now as well. We will set our boundaries. And we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of solution. For, if the Palestinians want to pick a fight with the Americans, that's their business. But I would argue it's counterproductive. You're going to have an election in November. And I'm not talking as a Republican or as a Democrat. But anybody looking at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting Palestinian statehood, you probably would want to see the re-election of the current president. You would probably want to see the re-election of the current president, which would mean essentially that you're not going to force him into a position to take action that will weaken the prospects of his own election. Finally, I'll come back to my initial point. Just because we're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that's going to take us farther away than ever from our goal. Admission of Palestine now without an agreement will take Palestinians farther away from sovereignty.

Your time is up. Thank you. A reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening statements in this of two fighting it out over this motion: "The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state. " You have heard the first two opening statements, and now onto the third. To debate in support of this motion that the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state, Palestinian democracy activist, secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative and Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Mustafa Barghouthi.
The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state|i2Debates/palestine.p|24|R2|MUSTAFA BARGHOUTHI|for|5|30|34|0|1|94|0|99|2|0|17|1|150|65|0|14|16|0|0|4|0|566|21|0|1|0|0|3|58|1|0|12|50|2|6|12|13|8|1|11|14|6|27|41|143|75|98|12|95|0|2|1|0|0|54|55|0|10|3|19|130|25|0|5|52|967|Thank you so much. And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate. I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN. The first is that time is not an infinite commodity. And time -- we're losing time. And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground, which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution. If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution. And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody. So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending. What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance. What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well. What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results. Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free. Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese. One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars. The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating. At the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about. And that is not a solution. So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy. We have one of three options. Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for. In this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against. And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about. Or the second option is violence, which we reject, and we don't want. The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States. And that's the course we are taking. And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road. My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign. If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not Palestine? And why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made. Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states, Israel was established. Palestine was not. My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground. We understand, but it will achieve three goals. First, it will give us hope. It will give Palestinians hope. Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle. Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things. Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements. And, third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free. We are now victims of oppression and discrimination. The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear. And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring. Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear. This is not the right approach. We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well. Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans, from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid. And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system, and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia. One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch. Today we are coming to the United Nations with two olive branches. Don't let us drop them. Thank you.

Our motion is "The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state. " Our final debater is going to speak against the motion. He's Dore Gold, world renowned expert on Middle Eastern affairs. He's former prime minister of Israel's foreign policy advisor and former ambassador to the United Nations. Dore Gold.

When I served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations back in the late 1990s, I had a colleague, a counterpart, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, became a very close friend, it's someone I intellectually admired. His name, unfortunately he's passed away, was Richard Holbrooke. And one of the things I was struck by, before I was sent to the U.N. I was the Israeli negotiator. I was sent to the sand dunes of Gaza where Muhammad picked me up in that extended Mercedes and take me to Arafat's house. We would discuss how to move forward in peace, and, by the way, those discussions were tough because he -- when you're in a meeting like that, you don't know where to park your head. Should you remember the Israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that came out of territory under Arafat's jurisdiction? I know that's tough to mention, but you've got to know that. Do you think of those people? Do you think about the moment? Do you think about building a future? Do you forget about the tragedies of the past so you'll have hope? How do you orient yourself? It's very, very tough. But I had that experience. We were involved in -- I spent hours with Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen. I spent a tremendous time on the Hebron Agreement with Aaron and of course the Wye Agreement that followed afterwards. And what I had seen in the '90s is that we didn't succeed. We didn't succeed. We reached agreements. And, by the way, the man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed two agreements with the Palestinians -- withdrew from territory, made sacrifices for peace, risked his whole political base because he wanted to move the process forward. It may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles, but I experienced that. But let me go back to Holbrooke. So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward. And after I left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office. And Barak went to Camp David with Yasser Arafat. The peace wasnt concluded. But I asked myself through my contacts with Holbrooke, How was it? And Richard Holbrooke delivered the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration, the Dayton Accords over Bosnia. Well, we didnt succeed in the Middle East. We failed at Camp David. Im not sure I still understand why that occurred. By the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between Croats, Bosnian Muslims, the Serbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial. It had all the ingredients that we had. But they persisted. They persisted to negotiate. I discerned from my discussions with Holbrooke and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements. He concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome. As much as you could be cynical about tough negotiations, thats the only outcome that will work. The second thing that comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that peacemaking must come from the parties themselves. The great breakthroughs of Dayton came from those three warring parties. Its true. They were brought to Ohio. Its true. Secretary of State was in and out. President Clinton was ready to come in. But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace. And finally, you need diplomatic flexibility. Let me tell you something. Both sides, certainly in our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of our cause. But tonights not the night to lay that out to you. The point is that even though you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go on every American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the American audience, you have got to make a compromise. Youve got to cut a deal. You cant walk away. And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because they knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility, in the Balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal. In fact, Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: Will the Bosnians grasp an imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton was convened? Now, let me move to the issue at hand between us. What is my problem with the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state? As I said in my opening words, this isnt about national dignity. You know, every people wants to recognized. And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of whos supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every national movement wants to be recognized to the U.N. So my question isnt about recognizing the rights of Palestinians. That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978. My question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold. First of all, carefully listening to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at the U.N. General Assembly, he wasnt just saying, Accept us in principle. He was laying out borders. And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, as though there was some kind of pre-67 boundary, border, that was an international line that we have to agree to. Thats it. When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borders were supposed to be negotiated. And that -- to that point, to that very point, Yasser Arafat agreed. He signed those agreements. Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement. The implement agreements, he later signed. So we're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the

And this is where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me. We have two teams of two. We have Mustafa Barghouthi and Daniel Levy who have been arguing that the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state for several reasons, including the fact that it introduces hope to the Palestinian people, and that hope militates against violence. Also, that in a peace process that is going nowhere, that is stuck, it lays down a marker that the Israelis cannot ignore. The team arguing against the motion, they include Dore Gold and Aaron David Miller, are arguing against this motion on the grounds, number one, that what exists now in the territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority doesn't really meet the qualifications of a state because it can't control its borders, it can't control its guns. And they're also arguing that it is too soon to give up on negotiation itself. So we're going to take questions from you. But first from me, I want to put a question to the side arguing against the motion. And I think, Dore, this may have been where you were heading. I want to understand why admission of the UN -- why admission of Palestine to the UN necessarily precludes the continuation of negotiations. Why can't there be this admission to the UN, and yet negotiations continue and ultimately a solution reached?

You know, for example, one of the hard choices that Mahmoud Abbas has to face, one of the critical issues that he has to deal with is announcing, it's the end of the conflict. By going to the UN, getting a Palestinian state, he doesn't have to do that. He doesn't have to come to terms with the question that we keep raising. We're being asked, recognize the rights of the Palestinians to an independent state. So we've done that. But we're asking the Palestinians to recognize the right of the Jewish people to a nation state of their own. That has to be in the package. But in fact, there -- there --

And I'm trying to understand why this would stop everything, and these negotiations could not continue on those points afterwards.

In 19 -- he has -- he has been talking a lot, so let me . In 1947, it was decided there would be two states. Israel would be on 54 percent of the land, Palestine on 44 percent of the land. Now we are accepting 22 percent. That's less than half of what we should have had according to the UN in '47. And Mr. Gold wants to take away parts of that land because for the settlements that keep growing, Israel is the only country in the world that has not told anybody what are its borders. Why?

Admission to the UN recognition would conflate with acknowledgment of sovereignty. Legally, that may not be the case, but that is the way it would be read. That is the way the Palestinian Authority would interpret it. And presumably, that is the way the international community might interpret it as well. And that, the notion that recognition and admission would create the mindset, the June 4, '67 borders have been established, have been laid down, would make it more difficult, even though, Mustafa and Daniel, it may well be the only rational, logical outcome is a negotiation with June 4, '67 borders as a basis. Second, you have a divided Palestinian polity. And let's not forget this point because it's fundamental to the entire argument. You're not dealing here with a negotiation which consists of one gun, one authority and one negotiating position. The notion that you would admit, as a member state, a divided Palestinian polity, half of which has not even signed up to the conditions that are essentially, by definition, basic to a negotiation --

Theres a certain reality which we, once we leave this theater tonight, well have to take account of there are only three ways that the Palestinian state will be born. Either the Palestinians will take it from the Israelis by force, which they are unable and I take you at your word, Mustafa, unwilling to do. Second, an international organization or body where the will of the international community will somehow deliver it to them on their behalf, but that is incredibly fanciful. The notion that admission into the U.N. will give you access to the ICC, the International Criminal Court, the Israelis will have their own case to be made against you. And, by the way --

I think its a shame that weve descended into a blame game here, and I want to try and pick up on the thread that I think Aaron was trying to reintroduce to the conversation. The Palestinians can take this by force. They can have it delivered to them by the international community. And Im guessing where youre going with the third one is they can convince the Israelis to actually withdraw. Or at least thats where I would go with it. And if youre about to tell me that they can wait for America to deliver it for them, then I suggest you see a production of Waiting for Godot. No, the point I want to make is that I think what the Israeli public needs to see right now, yes, theres a continued -- theres more of a Palestinian commitment and are continued by those who are already there, commitment to living alongside Israel, but I dont think a charm offensive is the entirety of the ingredients that we have to bring into the mix. We have to bring in the ingredients which say to the Israelis, Hey, I hope were moving away from violence, but we cant sit on the sidelines while you swallow up all of Palestine. So we're going to make declarative attempts. This does not mitigate against the fact that we want to live alongside you. We're not trying to replace you at the UN. But we do have to begin to accumulate some beginnings of a balance of leverage, some addressing of this asymmetry. I think that's productive for any future Israeli-Palestinian process.

Academic setting means we have to distill what the truth is about certain situations. And we have to report the facts. And it is interesting to share those facts when you come from Cairo, or I come from Jerusalem. And unfortunately, there is the fact that five days after your meeting in Cairo, Hamas, on its official website, Palestine-info.info, Hamas made the following statement. "We underline our adherence to our right to the struggle in all its forms, particularly the armed struggle. " That's not Martin Luther King. Sorry. And if I can just finish the sentence, it's not the UN charter which is our subject for tonight. And you can't embellish this. You can't somehow treat it as though it's not there, because you're asking these people to vote for admission of Palestine to the UN. If Palestine involves arms struggle, are you prepared to vote for arms struggle against my people, the people of Israel?

And all of these facts may be relevant to the larger argument. We're talking about the practicality or the morality of this motion. And we can talk about Cairo and who was at the meeting. And we got that point the very first time. And we can -- we know that Israel has a record that is offensive to the Palestinians. And we got that the first time. We would really ask you all to try to bring this level up to -- and I do think settlements are completely relevant, and you made that point well. But we would like to ask you to bring this up to a level of keeping this on the facts that are happening here. Now I'm going to the questions.

The second question is about the motion. And I want to say here that if we are admitted to the UN, the most important thing that will come out is that the illegal actions of settlements which are destroying the possibility of a two-state solution would be invalid. That means de facto creation of settlements on the ground does not undermine the right of the Palestinians to have a state. That will be good for peace and for two-state solution.

The day after you are admitted into the UN, nothing will change. And arguably -- and we've been arguing about it. Nothing is going to change because neither -- you need two powers to support and make sovereignty meaningful to you. You may have given up on them. You may have convinced yourselves that their administrations are bankrupt, and they may offer you no hope. But it is a reality that unless you can take what you want by force, unless the international community is going to give it to you, which they will not. They will not. They have the Iranians, they have the Syrians. People are standing in line to sanction well ahead of what the international community would do with respect to the Israelis. Your ultimate objective is to create -- and I would agree with Daniel -- a different constellation of forces to support a negotiation, to end the conflict. But you cannot create that improved balance by seeking admission into the UN. It will not improve your standing. And I have heard nothing in the last hour --

First, I really beg to differ with you on what looks different the morning after Palestine's admitted to the UN. In the following way, and this isn't just about Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition, but I do think that when Prime Minister Netanyahu can strut his stuff and say, "You see, the international community doesn't admit Palestine to the U.N.," I think that sends precisely the wrong signal to the Israeli public. I give credit to the Israeli public intelligence in knowing the cost benefit calculation of the signals they're receiving are not affirmative enough yet regarding two states, and I think it's that signal that matters, and I do think it's not going to change everything but it would change something in the discourse if Palestine is admitted to the U.N. And that's the kind of change that we need to begin to see happening.

I mean, as Ive said, I think there are two ways of coming at this. First of all, call me curmudgeonly pessimist, but I dont think the morning after Palestines admitted to the U.N., Israel is going to say, Ah, games up. Were withdrawing to the 67 lines now. So, in practical terms, you know, I believe that this is about what signals do we send, even as an academic exercise. So in practical terms, I think its a crucial question, but its not the morning after we all vote tonight or you all vote tonight or Palestine is admitted to the U.N. What I do think is -- and you know, lets be creative diplomatically here -- what I do think is you should be encouraging realistic terms for Palestinian reconciliation, for one authority with one gun. And I think part of the blend of how you do that could be using the very admission of Palestine to the U.N., the very signing of that U.N. charter to hold Hamas to a certain standard on violence. Personally, I think, the --

You know, in 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian election, not just in Gaza Strip but also in the West Bank. And Mahmoud al-Zahar, who would become the Hamas foreign minister, was asked by a Western correspondent, Are you willing to change the Hamas Charter from 1988, which, by the way, does not call just for the destruction of Israel. It calls for the murder of Jews. Its a genocidal document, and I have to use that language because thats what it is. And do you know how al-Zahar responded in 2006? Not a single word. And many of us thought, you know, British Gas has found huge gas deposits offshore in the Mediterranean next to the Gaza Strip. They want to have commerce with the EU, with the world. Theyll change. Theyll be flexible. Theyll meet the Quartet conditions. Hamas, in 2006 until our conflict with them in 2008, 2009, didnt move and still havent moved.

This is the fundamental problem. Just because negotiations are stuck, and I am the first person to acknowledge just how stuck they really are -- doesn't mean that in an effort to maintain hope, to diffuse desperation and to accommodate some measure of urgency, we need to pursue an idea that I would argue to you -- and you've, in my judgment, failed to demonstrate where the real upsides are. The downsides of this are very, very real. In July 2000, we decided to recommend to Bill Clinton to go to Camp David to try to create a conflict-ending solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Do you realize that a dozen years after that summit, we are still paying for the lack of wisdom and the recklessness of that decision? Israelis and Palestinians have not yet recovered from the trauma of those ten years, because we believed in an effort to do something in the face of a desperate situation, that we could make it better.

And I want to make another point here, because we've spoken an awful lot about Hamas. And anyway, as people have noticed, there's something going on in the Middle East. The Muslim Brotherhood, political Islam, of which Hamas is a part, is kind of popular when people get the chance to vote democratically. This is a reality we have to deal with. Now, we can bury our heads in the sand and say, there's a charter, and you have to stand up and publicly disavow X, Y or zed, or we can work, work day in, day out, to try and create a new reality that Hamas relates to, to try and create a new reality that the Muslim Brotherhood relates to, to work with this new reality in the Middle East. And the more Israel buries its head in the sand and says, you have to tick boxes X, Y and zed before we do anything, the worst we are going to make are predicament.

The last negotiation in my mind is one in which the Israelis traded one soldier for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists -- thousand -- excuse me. And I'm wondering, given the willingness on one side -- on behalf of one side of the debate, namely the Palestinians, to send in young boys and girls to kill themselves, how can you argue that the piece of cheese is entirely on the side of Israel and that the Palestinians are left with nothing to do? It seems like the willingness to commit suicide leaves them with a lot to do and transforms radically this balance of power which you're arguing has completely shifted to the side of the Israelis.

What you are describing -- what you are describing is something that is a long time disappeared. And if we keep going back to the past, we will not find a way to the future. You're asking why Israel exchanged one prisoner for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, because Palestinians had only one prisoner. And, by the way, by the way, by the way, there are still 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Do you know how it feels -- do you know how it feels -- what is strange to me is why when the Oslo agreement was signed, not all of the Palestinian prisoners were released, why did it take Hamas to capture an Israeli soldier so that spent 33 years in jail had to be released? Why couldn't they be released? Because of the peace agreement. This is the mistake.

This is a question of context, gentlemen, which I don't think we've heard in this debate. The last legitimate democratic election in Palestinian areas was won by the Hamas convincingly in 2006. The Palestinians, the PLO, Fatah as the lead faction of the PLO has failed to conduct negotiations in January 2010 and subsequent. So the only legitimate government in the eyes of the Palestinian people today is the Hamas. On the basis of Mr. Haniya in Gaza, he is the legitimate Palestinian leader in the eyes of the Palestinian people.

When Hamas won election, they got 44 percent of the votes and Fata got 41 percent. It was the stupidity of Fatah, who did not accept full proportional system that led to Hamas getting a majority in the parliament. Today I assure you there is a growing number of Palestinians that want to see a third alternative, which I think we represent. And I do not think that either Hamas or Fatah will get an absolute majority in any future elections. What you should encourage is that Palestine becomes a full state democracy with pluralism. I always believed and I still believe that the only way to have a peaceful -- a lasting peace between both sides is if we have two democracies negotiating an agreement and not to have an agreement enforced from one side to another.

I realize that in the last 90 minutes that perhaps one of the most astute things that Ive done, one of the best decisions Ive made was to leave the Arab-Israeli negotiating process. And I say that with tremendous respect and affection for everybody on this panel. If the goal is achieving statehood, if that is really the goal, then it seems to me that U.N. admission simply doesnt make much sense. You alienate the two countries that Palestinians will need -- Israel and the United States -- to produce meaningful and legitimate Palestinian sovereignty. You will kill Salam Fayyads nation-state building effort. Theres no question about that. And youre putting your hope in an international community that has never ever abandoned you, actually, but isnt capable of delivering your sovereignty. And I would argue that even though, Dan, you persist in saying that we havent demonstrated what the downsides are, I think given, in my judgment, the risks of admission and the uncertainties that will certainly follow, other than hope, which is extremely important, and diffusing a measure of desperation, even more important, you havent demonstrated how in effect U.N. membership will bring Mustafa Barghouthi and his people any closer, any closer to negotiating Jerusalem borders, security, refugee into meaningful statehood. Maybe the strategy has more to do with internal Palestinian politics with Mahmoud Abbass exit strategy, with the Arab spring and the Arab winter, with a full reconciliation with Hamas. In effect, if that is your objective, well then maybe you should seek U.N. admission but not if you want to facilitate the negotiations. My good friend, Daniel Levy, wrote the day before yesterday, the PLO strategy -- the PLO has a bad case of strategic combobulation. And the U.N-Palestinian effort was a weak -- a damp squib, a damp squib -- damp squib --

I think the Palestinians should pursue this in a different way, and its going to take time, but theres a strategy for getting there. Weve spoken a lot here about Hamas. But I think the way you further empower Hamas and discourage change in Hamas is to close all nonviolent diplomatic options in the face of the Palestinians. I know people here. And I also dont like to hear the word apartheid. Heres what the Israeli minister of defense, Ehud Barak, said in February 2010, The simple truth, there is one state including Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Its either bi-national or undemocratic. That will be an apartheid state. Thats the tragedy that we want to prevent. And you know what? Our toolbox is an impoverished one because we have tried so much already. But sticking exclusively with negotiations really must be the dumbest idea. So what do we have left thats nonviolent. Lets use the international tools of diplomacy that are at our disposal to make a statement. We havent heard negative consequences that can come from this. And mostly we havent heard what else to do except to blindly continue to place our faith in negotiations or that the Palestinians somehow should only be ingratiating themselves without creating any leverage with Israel and America. Its been tried. It hasnt worked. The risk is the status quo. The risk is the continued dissent of Israeli democracy to a place where it will be unrecognizable and an inability to reach a two-state solution. We need to send a signal here from this room that Palestine should be admitted to the UN. And the UN needs to send a signal to Israelis and Palestinians that there's going to be a two-state solution, otherwise the next debate will be about equal rights in one indivisible territorial unit. I'm not against equal rights in democracy, but I want an Israel, an Israel that's different, that changes. But I want an Israel. And I'm sure Mustafa wants a Palestine. And we should have both of those as member states of the UN.

And I am sorry that at certain points in this discussion we got heated. But the stakes are not just winning a debate in this very nice auditorium in NYU. This is about issues that relate to our very existence. I started, before I was cut off earlier on, telling you that when we withdrew from the Gaza strip in 2005, we had great hopes that we were removing a cause, an irritant, and therefore, Prime Minister Sharon, whom I knew very well, decided to take that risk and pulled out unilaterally. And instead of rocket fire dropping as a result, it increased between 2005 and 2006 by 500 percent. The state of Israel is obligated to make sure that whatever arrangement we make on the West Bank doesn't replicate the conditions in the Gaza Strip. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Mahmoud Abbas has decided on a course of action that he actually began at the end of the Olmert government. It's a course of unilateralism. And with this unilateralism is an effort to get recognized as a Palestinian state with UN membership, without having to address our concerns, without having to address the security of Israel, without having to recognize my people's right to a nation state, even though I'm being asked to recognize his people's right to a nation state. And finally, to predetermine the outcome of negotiations by going to the UN and saying, the borders will be June 4, even though the UN back in '67 said we weren't going back to the exact '67 lines. And therefore, I suggest to you, particularly in light of the fact that we're seeing an effort to sell you an unreformed Hamas, and unreformed Islamic Jihadist part of the Palestinian political community, to reject the notion that the Palestinians should be accepted as a member state until they change.

Mr. Gold has repeated practically what Weisglass, who was an advisor to Mr. Sharon when he said that we withdraw from Gaza so that we can put peace in formaldehyde. We can put peace to sleep. Unfortunately, creating fear is not a solution. And everything that Mr. Miller and Gold have suggested today is nothing but wasting time and using time. And I am telling them, you can maybe afford to lose time because you haven't lived for 44 years under occupation. You haven't lived in this position for a long time. And you haven't been humiliated every day by occupying forces. You can maybe even afford to be sarcastic, gloomy, and even depressed. But that will not bring change. Yes, the peace process has become a substitute to peace, and that's why we need to change the situation. I cannot afford to lose time because this is about my life, about my daughter's life, and it's about the lives of the Palestinians and Israelis. And the Israelis themselves cannot afford it. When I ask people, what do you want? They say we want jobs, we want education, and we want health care. We could not have had that -- we couldn't have that because we have occupation. And this needs to end. What the Israelis want is also security. But that also cannot be available as long as Palestinians are insulted and humiliated. Where Azizi in Tunisia created a revolution because he brought the issue of dignity to people's minds. And every day, thousands of Palestinians dignity is harmed. What we are trying to say to bring light in the end of the tunnel. When you vote today, don't take away hope. Don't take away light at the end of the tunnel. And let me remind you here with what Plato said. He said, We can easily forgive children for being afraid of dark. The tragedy is when grown people are afraid of light. "

So I want to -- there is no need to apologize for bringing a little bit of heat to the conversation tonight. In fact, it was justified and passionate. But I also have a thing for light. And so I like to bring as much light as heat. And I think that ultimately this team -- both teams rose to that. And I want to thank you for hearing each other and for hearing me. And debating this honestly and fairly. And I also want to thank members of the audience who had the guts to get up and ask questions. And the vast majority were very good and very on point and really did move this along. So a round of applause to those of you who are able to get up and ask questions. So we'll have the vote -- the results of the vote in just a minute. What I'll do is I'll read off the preliminary numbers for, against and undecided, and then the final numbers, for, against and undecided. And the team with the largest difference will be declared our winner. In the meantime, very briefly, I want to tell you about our next debate. It's coming up on February 7th. And in light of the fact that there is a health crisis in this country of many, many varieties, but we're going to be talking about the obesity epidemic, with 33 percent of adults in this country, and 17 percent of children obese, we thought it was time to find a way to look at this issue as a matter of debate. And the way that we're looking at it is whether -- where is the issue of personal responsibility and government responsibility in this in terms of, are people obese simply because they eat too much, or are they obese because they're being advertised to because of what's in food, and additives, the proliferation of fast food. And does government have a role in that or not. Basically, whose fault is it? And who should do something about it? Arguing in support of the following motion: "Obesity is the government's business will be Pamela Peeke, also a medical doctor. She's a nationally renowned physician, a scientist and an expert in the fields of nutrition and fitness. And on web MD, she is the chief lifestyle expert. The team arguing against this, that's saying obesity is not the government's business, is Paul Campos. He is author of "The Obesity Myth. " He's a Constitutional law professor who came to this issue in an unusual way. He was watching all of the coverage of the Monica Lewinsky story back in the late '90s, and he became obsessed with the obsession in the news media over Monica Lewinsky's weight. And he just started thinking. And he ended up writing some books and has strong points of view on this issue. And his debating partner, also arguing that it is not the government's business, but a matter of personal responsibility, John Stossel, an Emmy award-winning journalist. He is host of FOX Business Network's Stossel, a weekly program that highlights consumer issues. He is a contrarian. If you know him, who would like government to stop meddling in people's business. And he is himself a very, very slender television correspondent. And I can -- I can only admire him. So we'll take just about 30 seconds more. And the results will come to us. But thank you very much for your patience. Okay. I've got them. I've just been given the results. Remember now, we had you vote twice. You've heard this debate, this argument, the arguments for and against this motion, "The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state. " We asked you to vote before and again afterwards. The vote afterwards telling us which side you feel presented the better argument. Before the debate, 37 percent were in support of the motion that the U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state, 30 percent were against, and 33 percent were undecided. After the debate, 55 percent support this motion, that is up 18 percent, 37 percent are against, that is up only seven percent, the undecideds went down by 25 percent to eight percent. That means the motion has carried, the side arguing the U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state has won this debate. Our congratulations to them. Thank you from me, John Donvan, and Intelligence Squared U.S. We'll see you next time.
