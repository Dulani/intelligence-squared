intelligence-squared
====================

Competitive discourse is a hallmark of the human experience.  The intent for this project is two part: (a) to explore how we debate eachother, and (b) to develop new methodologies for studying and visualizing debates.  Since 2006 the Intelligence Squared US project (http://intelligencesquaredus.org/) has hosted many debates (83 as of January 2014) on relevant public policy concerns.  Guest debaters have included former Governors, ambassadors, as well as authors and scholars.  Unlike other debate shows Intelligence Squared polls the audience before and after each debate, which provides research with an interesting measure of argument effectiveness.  The python scripts, modules, and data within this repository are meant to be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) efforts to expose speaker sentiment, collaboration, and to provide annotations that might aid audience member comprehension of the sometimes jargon and fact riddled material.
