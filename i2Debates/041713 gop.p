S'Now, I did this once before, and the competitive juices got going, and I turned into an'
p302
aS'insufferable jerk attacking the other side. So before I do that, I want to just express my'
p303
aS'love and admiration for my opponents. We came into this business together, Laura, the'
p304
aS'slowly aging portrait of Ralph that he keeps in his attic, and I --'
p305
aS'And just complete admiration for them, the fact that they -- the Democrats have hired'
p306
aS'them to burrow within the Republican Party and to destroy it from within, I do not hold'
p307
aS'against you.'
p308
aS'Now, I admit I was on the left at one point. In the \'60s, my parents took me to a "be in"'
p309
aS'where hippies would go just to be. And to demonstrate their liberation from money and'
p310
aS'material things, they threw their wallets into a garbage can. I was five. I saw a five'
p311
aS'dollar bill on fire in the garbage can. I ran into the fire, grabbed the money and ran'
p312
aS'away. And that was my first step over to the right in my life. Kept going. But we had'
p313
aS'one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants,'
p314
aS'lower east side, a Jewish kid trying to make it in the city. We had the attitude, the think'
p315
aS'Yiddish act British attitude, "We\'ll fit in." We had the dream of making it in the city'
p316
aS"which meant making it in this neighborhood where we're standing, in the upper west"
p317
aS'side, the Upper East Side.'
p318
aS'And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started. It was started by Abraham'
p319
aS'Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it. And he did it when he was in the'
p320
aS'state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and'
p321
aS'achieve social mobility. He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals'
p322
aS'and railroads. He got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, Homestead Act,'
p323
aS'Land-Grant College Act, even introduced the income tax. It was using government to'
p324
aS'give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed. And that was still around when I got'
p325
aS'there, when I got to Washington. Ronald Reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible'
p326
aS'person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using'
p327
aS'government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed.'
p328
aS' Reagan did it. Is the Republican Party doing it now? I think they have not because'
p329
aS"they've been so hostile to government. Ronald Reagan was more pragmatic than the"
p330
aS'current Republican Party.'
p331
aS"It's also no longer 1980. Now if you want to rise and succeed, it's not enough just to"
p332
aS'work hard and row a boat across the Ohio River like Lincoln. Think of a poor girl who'
p333
aS"wants to be like Lincoln today. She can't just work hard ferrying people across that"
p334
aS'river. She grows up probably without a father. She grows up in a chaotic community'
p335
aS"with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds. To succeed, she's"
p336
aS"probably going to need some language instruction. She's probably going to need some"
p337
aS"early -- some protection from early childhood distresses that'll destroy her self-control."
p338
aS" She's going to need institutions that'll help her build relationships so she can use people"
p339
aS"as tools for learning throughout life. She's probably going to have to spend 21 years in"
p340
aS'education to qualify for a middle class job. And so what does the Republican Party'
p341
aS'today have to say to her? Almost nothing. This party is encased in a simplistic and'
p342
aS'archaic metric, government versus the market. Government bad, the market good.'
p343
aS"If you're an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your"
p344
aS"central pain. If you're that little girl, the government is not your big problem. If you're"
p345
aS'that little girl, the government, through Pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping'
p346
aS'you work hard and becoming a better capitalist. Does the Republican Party offer'
p347
aS'anything? No, which is why Asian Americans, for example, voted against the Republican'
p348
aS'Party three times to one. The Republican Party has become so hostile to government'
p349
aS'that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer. So hostile to government'
p350
aS"they can't really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with. And so this is a"
p351
aS'party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its'
p352
aS'founding principle. And the country knows that. Republicans have lost five out of the'
p353
aS"last six popular votes in the elections. They've lost the Senate. They should have won."
p354
aS' They held onto the House by force of redistricting. The Republican party has a 33'
p355
aS'percent overall approval rating when the Democrats have 47 percent. You take every'
p356
aS'rising group in America. The Republican Party is losing that group. Latinos, by 4 to 1.'
p357
aS'Asian Americans, by 3 to 1. African Americans, by 9 to 1. People in single households by'
p358
aS"2 to 1. They're getting slaughtered among young people. If this electorate, and the"
p359
aS'electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men -- white men, the party'
p360
aS'would be doing awesome.'
p361
aS'This party is not that party. This party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white'
p362
aS"America that's never coming back and has to move to recapture that. It has -- and what"
p363
aS"is the people's top criticism of the Republican Party? Recent Gallup poll this week, the"
p364
aS"top criticism is they do not compromise. So this is a party going down the drain. It's a"
p365
aS"party that's unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns,"
p366
aS'apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration.'
p367
aS'Bob Bennett of Utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the Senate for working'
p368
aS'with a Democrat. I had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the Senate -'
p369
aS'- terrified of getting primaried from the right. Unwilling to have any flexibility.'
p370
aS'Becoming an uncompromising party. To me, this is a party that has to tackle two big'
p371
aS'issues. The first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable. The'
p372
aS'second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that'
p373
aS"Charles Murray writes about. And my advice to the Republican Party: don't move to the"
p374
aS'center for the sake of moving to the center. The center is nothing. Move to the center'
p375
aS'for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility.'
p376
aS"Do right by that little girl and you'll do right by yourself politically. And that means"
p377
aS'having a positive agenda. It means being more flexible. It means being prudent and'
p378
aS'sensible, not a party of a red rump of America.'
p379
aS"And so, I don't necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism. But I"
p380
aS'want to call them back to their essence as a party. And so, I ask you to vote for the'
p381
aS'proposition. Thank you.'

S"Thank you very much. It's great to be here on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, or as"
p408
aS'I like to refer to it, my mission field.'
p409
aS'I feel a little bit more at home since I got to walk past Lincoln Center. Makes me feel a'
p410
aS'little more at home to know that a Republican president has something named after'
p411
aS'him in this part of town.'
p412
aS"And you know, it's good to be here with Mickey Edwards and David Brooks, who was"
p413
aS"often referred to in Republican ranks as Obama's favorite conservative. And I'm"
p414
aS'looking forward to a very lively and spirited debate. You know, I think for those of us'
p415
aS'who grew up in this party -- and I knocked on doors and walked precincts in my first'
p416
aS"campaign for a Republican candidate, 35 years ago -- we've seen this movie before."
p417
aS'Virtually everything that David just said from that podium would have been said in 1949'
p418
aS'after Dewey lost. It would have been said in 1965 after Barry Goldwater lost. It was'
p419
aS"said in 1977 after Ford lost. It's been said every time the Republicans lose a major"
p420
aS'election. And I would just say, paraphrasing Mark Twain, When it comes to the'
p421
aS'Republican Party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.'
p422
aS"And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential"
p423
aS'nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited,'
p424
aS"the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in"
p425
aS"decades. And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics. First of all,"
p426
aS'look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate,'
p427
aS'117 in the House. Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after those'
p428
aS'devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure. And the'
p429
aS"party's brand then was even lower than it is now. 36 in the Senate, 144 in the House."
p430
aS'Even after George H.W. Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by the'
p431
aS'way, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932. The Republicans at that point'
p432
aS'stood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House. You compare that to today where'
p433
aS"they have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question that"
p434
aS"the Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina. or Scott Walker in"
p435
aS'Wisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among the'
p436
aS'most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country,'
p437
aS'reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising'
p438
aS"taxes. The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be"
p439
aS'sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level.'
p440
aS"And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level. The"
p441
aS'Republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010. They controlled both Houses of'
p442
aS'24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats. So I tell you what the Democrats are going'
p443
aS"to find out. They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a"
p444
aS'lot of fun. For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack. For Nixon,'
p445
aS'it was Watergate and Vietnam. For Clinton, it was impeachment. For Reagan, it was the'
p446
aS"loss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra. And, of"
p447
aS"course, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq. Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's"
p448
aS'only been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in his'
p449
aS'second off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998.'
p450
aS"So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries. I'll quote"
p451
aS'you one from 1993. This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, "We'
p452
aS'should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and'
p453
aS'dying past." Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House and'
p454
aS"Senate for the first time in 40 years. My second point would be we've tried this before."
p455
aS" This formula's been applied. If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that once"
p456
aS'produced Nixon, Reagan, , and other great conservatives. They moved to'
p457
aS'the mushy middle. They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro-'
p458
aS'choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate.'
p459
aS'And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction,'
p460
aS'having followed these same policies that are being recommended now. Only 25 out of'
p461
aS'80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate,'
p462
aS"following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally. And the other"
p463
aS'thing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie. If the Republican Party'
p464
aS'walks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of the'
p465
aS'electorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass-'
p466
aS'attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics. They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney.'
p467
aS' That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and the'
p468
aS'Union vote combined. And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles,'
p469
aS'those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party will'
p470
aS'become the Whig Party.'
p471
aS"One last thing because I'm running out of time. I'm an old high school and collegiate"
p472
aS"debater. Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate. And remember what this"
p473
aS'resolution says. It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to say'
p474
aS'become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the'
p475
aS'Democrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die. It doesn\'t say, "lose'
p476
aS'elections. It doesn\'t say, "under perform among minorities."'
p477
aS'It says, "it will die." Now, based on what I have just told you about the state of the'
p478
aS'Republican Party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution.'
p479
aS'Thank you very much.'

p522
aS'more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country'
p523
aS'well?'
p524
aS'And if they do not, if they do not stand for where America is and where America is'
p525
aS'going, what claim can they make for support from the American people who find a party'
p526
aS'that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is'
p527
aS"going to elect America's political leaders for years to come? The fact is, Ralph, this is not"
p528
aS"the country of 1964 that the party recovered from. It's going to be much harder to"
p529
aS'recover in a society that looks like the one we have become. Let me be clear. I do not'
p530
aS'think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative. The problem is that what'
p531
aS'it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what'
p532
aS'American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald'
p533
aS'Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today.'
p534
aS" It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like"
p535
aS'prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they'
p536
aS'were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be. I spent a good many'
p537
aS'years championing the Republican Party and conservatism. Among the other things,'
p538
aS'besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action'
p539
aS"Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election. And I"
p540
aS'have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change'
p541
aS'in the opposite direction. Americans still agree with conservative principles.'
p542
aS"They defend the right of citizens to own guns. But they don't applaud a party that"
p543
aS'supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants'
p544
aS"and schools and churches. The people support conservatism, but they don't support a"
p545
aS"political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its"
p546
aS'unacceptable extremes. You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has'
p547
aS"been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the Republican"
p548
aS'Party. The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower'
p549
aS"taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the"
p550
aS"line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government,"
p551
aS"they say, No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase, who"
p552
aS'are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil.'
p553
aS"You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work."
p554
aS" And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it."
p555
aS'Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations'
p556
aS"with giant tax loopholes. And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to"
p557
aS'protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to'
p558
aS'pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe. So we have two'
p559
aS'questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made. What does it'
p560
aS'mean to move to the center? I would not suggest that moving to the center means'
p561
aS'finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in'
p562
aS'a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a'
p563
aS'politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle'
p564
aS'that self-government, government of the people, works.'
p565
aS'And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but'
p566
aS'fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and'
p567
aS'then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one'
p568
aS"America. That's what the American people don't see."
p569
aS"That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party. So people are"
p570
aS'fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that'
p571
aS'traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and'
p572
aS'nominates for office. Will it doom the Republican Party? You saw Barack Obama with'
p573
aS"his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected. Laura has written that it's"
p574
aS"Mitt Romney's fault. Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people? It's the"
p575
aS'only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he'
p576
aS'did.'
p577
aS'So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great'
p578
aS'chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate. Everybody thought we'
p579
aS'would win control. Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate. In fact, they'
p580
aS'gained seats. Why did they gain seats? Because Republicans put up candidates that'
p581
aS'allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who'
p582
aS'-- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they'
p583
aS'just could not go there. So the other question is what it means to be a political party.'
p584
aS" And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but"
p585
aS"being a serious contributor to the governance of America. So what's really at stake here"
p586
aS'are two things: Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can'
p587
aS'survive, and second, whether it should.'
p588
aS'The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the'
p589
aS'search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it,'
p590
aS'my party, will disappear, and it should. Please vote for the proposition.'

p620
aS'opportunity to be here. Last -- on Saturday, I was at the NRA 500. Do you guys know'

p628
aS'actually pick the winner like in 2000? Can we actually get Justice Scalia to write the'
p629
aS'opinion? I have to say that debating with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards, the politics'
p630
aS"-- David Brooks, an esteemed columnist for the New York Times, in New York is like -- it's"
p631
aS'like Barack Obama debating Wayne LaPierre about gun control at a gun show, okay?'
p632
aS' The odds are definitely stacked against us. But you must vote against this proposition.'
p633
aS" A couple of points first to Mickey's argument."
p634
aS" If Mickey's argument is correct, then one would think that in the bluest of states, which"
p635
aS'would be very hospitable to moderate Republican views, quote, "centrist views," people'
p636
aS'like Scott Brown would be victorious. Scott Brown obviously went down in flames. One'
p637
aS'would think that someone like the very centrist Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin would'
p638
aS'have won his Senate seat. Unfortunately Tommy Thompson, thought of as a middle-of-'
p639
aS'the-road Republican, went down in flames. Republicans had their issues, but for every'
p640
aS'Todd Aiken and Richard Murdoch, I can cite a Republican moderate who could not make'
p641
aS'the grade. The proposition should be rejected because moderate Republicanism, going'
p642
aS'to this mythical center, has been tried, and it has failed repeatedly. Last two elections.'
p643
aS" The Republican Party already died. It died in 2000 with the elite's choice, which was"
p644
aS'John McCain. Remember, back then, Mitt Romney was the insurgent candidate. I'
p645
aS'supported Mitt Romney in 2008.'
p646
aS'He was going up against John McCain, who was for immigration reform. He worked for'
p647
aS'Ted Kennedy on a bunch of issues. He was for McCain-Feingold. John McCain was the'
p648
aS"media's favorite Republican. John McCain went down in flames. Move forward to the"
p649
aS'last election. Everyone said, The only guy who could beat Barack Obama would be Mitt'
p650
aS"Romney. Couldn't be that Rick Santorum. Certainly couldn't be Newt Gingrich. Gosh,"
p651
aS'Jon Huntsman, the other moderate Republican, he got no traction. Lo and behold, Mitt'
p652
aS'Romney ran. Mitt Romney lost. Moderates usually lose elections with few exceptions.'
p653
aS'And before you pull out the Chris Christie is a moderate and everybody loves him'
p654
aS'example, let me tell you what The New York Times said about Chris Christie in 2009:'
p655
aS'Chris Christie, described as plainly conservative on issues such as school choice, rolling'
p656
aS'back regulations, and very restrictionist on abortion. Chris Christie won the'
p657
aS'governorship of New Jersey with the help of people like yours truly, the early Tea Party'
p658
aS'and conservatives.'
p659
aS'He was no middle-of-the-road centrist when he won. The proposition should be'
p660
aS'rejected for another reason. The mythical center. The proposition misunderstands'
p661
aS"what the word center means. Think about this. You don't seize the center. You create"
p662
aS'the center. Think about this. George Bush saying that conservatives should be more'
p663
aS'compassionate. Or Marco Rubio saying that you have to agree with Chuck Schumer on'
p664
aS"immigration. You say that. I don't know what you -- what you've seen, but to me, it"
p665
aS'seems a little bit more weak than you would have seemed if you just said, You know,'
p666
aS'these are my views. Take them or leave them. But Barack Obama -- did he seize the'
p667
aS"center in, let's say, 1994? When Newt Gingrich was changing the face of Republican"
p668
aS'politics in 1994 or when Ronald Reagan was triumphantly winning elections in the'
p669
aS"1980s, did young Barack Obama say to himself, Gosh, I've got to seize the center."
p670
aS"I've got to move and adopt a new point of view, and a new tone, and a new idea,"
p671
aS'because guess what? Conservatism is all the rage. Unilateral disarmament is out the'
p672
aS"window. I need to seize the center. Of course he didn't do that. And he was very"
p673
aS'smart not to do that. Constantly changing viewpoints are a fact of life in the United'
p674
aS'States. They usually change when someone makes a coherent, strong argument that'
p675
aS'the status quo is unacceptable, that the policies that are being advocated by the other'
p676
aS"side actually don't help the American people. So that to say, seize the center or die"
p677
aS"doesn't mean anything. I can remember when the center was the Defense of Marriage"
p678
aS'Act. Barack Obama believed in that centrist position. So did Bill Clinton. So did Hillary'
p679
aS'Clinton. So did most Americans. The left found a new way to approach it and guess'
p680
aS'what? The center changed.'
p681
aS'I can remember when the center position was for the war in Iraq. David was a big'
p682
aS'supporter of the war in Iraq, as was I. But guess what? Facts changed. Circumstances'
p683
aS'changed. Arguments changed. The center changed. Does that mean that people who'
p684
aS'had a principled view about the war in Iraq should seize the center and just admit that'
p685
aS'the war in Iraq was wrong? If that happened and, David, you wrote that column, I must'
p686
aS'have missed that.'
p687
aS'The proposition should be rejected because it misunderstands what a political party is.'
p688
aS"Mickey touched on this -- and I agree with him on this point. A political party doesn't"
p689
aS"exist just to get elected, right? A political party exists to make people's lives better."
p690
aS"Edmund Burke -- I'm sure a lot of fans of Burke out there. But Edmund Burke said that,"
p691
aS'Look. A political party is to implement certain agreed on principles. And by the way, it'
p692
aS'should -- you should reject the entreaties of the elites who will urge you to change your'
p693
aS'principles to fit the mood of the day.'
p694
aS'We saw, time and again, people who come across as flip-floppers. They want to change'
p695

p733
aS'two teams of two arguing this motion, "The GOP must seize the center or die." We have'
p734
aS"David Brooks and Mickey Edwards in support of the motion. We've heard them say that"
p735
aS'the Republican Party has become too hostile to government, that it is losing ethnic'
p736
aS'minorities and young people, and that those are two growing groups. They say that'
p737
aS'resistance to compromise is not a winning message and that the party has found itself at'
p738
aS'odds with the more diverse population. The side arguing against the motion, "The GOP'
p739
aS'must seize the center or die, Ralph Reed and Laura Ingraham.'
p740
aS"They've argued that the sky is not at all falling for the GOP, that the GOP is doing very,"
p741
aS'very well in the states and in local governments, that it has had these losing streaks'
p742
aS'before and has bounced back, and that never has a move to the mushy middle, as they'
p743
aS'called it, turned out to be a winning strategy, and if they tried and compromised their'
p744
aS'core convictions, they would alienate a base that is too large to be alienated. They'
p745
aS"would lose. I want to put a question -- I see that we're already debating this whole"
p746
aS'notion of what are we talking about when we say there is a center. And I want to put to'
p747
aS'the side arguing against the motion -- against the notion of compromise on this. You'
p748
aS'have said that the center is really a moving target; it can change by the month or by the'
p749
aS'year. One of your opponents, Mickey Edwards, put it a different way. He talked about'
p750
aS"the center as an approach to your opponents, an approach to the process, that it's a"
p751
aS'willingness to compromise, and that ultimately being willing to go to the center is a'
p752
aS"willingness to go to the common ground, and when you get there, that's where the"
p753
aS'center is.'

p2751
aS'Americans said government was too big and was doing too much. 41 percent of the'

p2761
aS'those things and remain an authentic, genuine, Reagan-style conservative. And if the'
p2762
aS"Republican Party doesn't do that, if it moves to the mushy middle, if it tries to trim its"
