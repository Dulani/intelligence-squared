p411
aS'And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started.'
p412
aS'It was started by Abraham Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it.'
p413
aS'And he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility.'
p414
aS'He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads.'

aS'Is the Republican Party doing it now?'
p421
aS"I think they have not because they've been so hostile to government."

p432
aS"She's probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job."

p603

p604

p605
aS"And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited, the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in decades."
p606
aS"And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics."
p607
aS'First of all, look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate, 117 in the House.'
p608
aS'Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after those devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure.'
p609
aS"And the party's brand then was even lower than it is now."
p610
aS'36 in the Senate, 144 in the House.'
p611
aS'Even after George H.W.'
p612
aS'Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by the way, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932.'
p613
aS'The Republicans at that point stood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House.'
p614
aS"You compare that to today where they have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question that the Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina."
p615
aS'or Scott Walker in Wisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among the most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country, reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising taxes.'
p616
aS"The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level."
p617
aS"And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level."
p618
aS'The Republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010.'
p619
aS'They controlled both Houses of 24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats.'
p620
aS'So I tell you what the Democrats are going to find out.'
p621
aS"They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a lot of fun."
p622
aS'For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack.'
p623
aS'For Nixon, it was Watergate and Vietnam.'
p624
aS'For Clinton, it was impeachment.'
p625
aS"For Reagan, it was the loss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra."
p626
aS'And, of course, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq.'
p627
aS"Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's only been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in his second off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998."
p628
aS'So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries.'
p629
aS"I'll quote you one from 1993."
p630
aS'This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, "We should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and dying past.'
p631
aS'" Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.'
p632
aS"My second point would be we've tried this before."
p633
aS"This formula's been applied."
p634
aS"If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that once produced Nixon, Reagan, , and other great conservatives."
p635
aS'They moved to the mushy middle.'
p636
aS'They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro- choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate.'
p637
aS'And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction, having followed these same policies that are being recommended now.'
p638
aS"Only 25 out of 80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate, following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally."
p639
aS'And the other thing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie.'
p640
aS'If the Republican Party walks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of the electorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass- attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics.'
p641
aS'They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney.'
p642
aS'That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and the Union vote combined.'
p643
aS'And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles, those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party will become the Whig Party.'
p644
aS"One last thing because I'm running out of time."
p645
aS"I'm an old high school and collegiate debater."
p646
aS"Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate."
p647
aS'And remember what this resolution says.'
p648
aS'It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to say become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the Democrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die.'
p649
aS'It doesn\'t say, "lose elections.'
p650
aS'It doesn\'t say, "under perform among minorities.'
p651
aS'" It says, "it will die.'
p652

aS"And I would just say, paraphrasing Mark Twain, When it comes to theRepublican Party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidentialnominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited,the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been indecades."
p672
aS"And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics."
p673
aS'First of all,look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate,117 in the House.'
p674
aS'Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after thosedevastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure.'
p675
aS"And theparty's brand then was even lower than it is now."
p676
aS'36 in the Senate, 144 in the House.Even after George H.W.'
p677
aS'Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by theway, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932.'
p678
aS'The Republicans at that pointstood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House.'
p679
aS"You compare that to today wherethey have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question thatthe Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina."
p680
aS'or Scott Walker inWisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among themost popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country,reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raisingtaxes.'
p681
aS"The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't besold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level.And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level."
p682
aS'TheRepublicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010.'
p683
aS'They controlled both Houses of24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats.'
p684
aS'So I tell you what the Democrats are goingto find out.'
p685
aS"They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't alot of fun."
p686
aS'For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack.'
p687
aS'For Nixon,it was Watergate and Vietnam.'
p688
aS'For Clinton, it was impeachment.'
p689
aS"For Reagan, it was theloss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra."
p690
aS'And, ofcourse, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq.'
p691
aS"Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there'sonly been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in hissecond off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998.So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries."
p692
aS"I'll quoteyou one from 1993."
p693
aS'This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, "Weshould not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead anddying past.'
p694
aS'" Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House andSenate for the first time in 40 years.'
p695
aS"My second point would be we've tried this before."
p696
aS"This formula's been applied."
p697
aS"If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that onceproduced Nixon, Reagan, , and other great conservatives."
p698
aS'They moved tothe mushy middle.'
p699
aS'They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro-choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate.And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction,having followed these same policies that are being recommended now.'
p700
aS"Only 25 out of80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate,following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally."
p701
aS'And the otherthing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie.'
p702
aS'If the Republican Partywalks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of theelectorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass-attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics.'
p703
aS'They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney.'
p704
aS'That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and theUnion vote combined.'
p705
aS"And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles,those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party willbecome the Whig Party.One last thing because I'm running out of time."
p706
aS"I'm an old high school and collegiatedebater."
p707
aS"Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate."
p708
aS'And remember what thisresolution says.'
p709
aS'It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to saybecome a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where theDemocrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die.'
p710
aS'It doesn\'t say, "loseelections.'
p711
aS'It doesn\'t say, "under perform among minorities.'
p712
aS'"It says, "it will die.'
p713
aS'" Now, based on what I have just told you about the state of the [[laughter]] Republican Party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution.Thank you very much.'

p753

p756
aS'The fact is, Ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from.'
p757
aS"It's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become."
p758
aS'Let me be clear.'
p759
aS'I do not think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative.'
p760
aS'The problem is that what it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today.'
p761
aS"It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be."
p762
aS'I spent a good many years championing the Republican Party and conservatism.'
p763
aS"Among the other things, besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election."
p764
aS'And I have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change in the opposite direction.'
p765
aS'Americans still agree with conservative principles.'
p766
aS'They defend the right of citizens to own guns.'
p767
aS"But they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches."
p768
aS"The people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes."
p769
aS"You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the Republican Party."
p770
aS"The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government, they say, No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase, who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil."
p771
aS"You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work."
p772
aS"And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it."
p773
aS'Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes.'
p774
aS"And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe."
p775
aS'So we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made.'
p776
aS'What does it mean to move to the center?'
p777
aS'I would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works.'
p778
aS'And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one America.'
p779
aS"That's what the American people don't see."
p780
aS"That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party."
p781
aS'So people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and nominates for office.'
p782
aS'Will it doom the Republican Party?'
p783
aS'You saw Barack Obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected.'
p784
aS"Laura has written that it's Mitt Romney's fault."
p785
aS'Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people?'
p786
aS"It's the only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did."
p787
aS'So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate.'
p788
aS'Everybody thought we would win control.'
p789
aS'Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate.'
p790
aS'In fact, they gained seats.'
p791
aS'Why did they gain seats?'
p792
aS'Because Republicans put up candidates that allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who -- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they just could not go there.'
p793
aS'So the other question is what it means to be a political party.'
p794
aS"And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of America."
p795
aS"So what's really at stake here are two things: Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can survive, and second, whether it should."
p796
aS'The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it, my party, will disappear, and it should.'
