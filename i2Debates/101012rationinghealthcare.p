(lp42
S'Good evening, everyone.'
p43
aS'Hi.'
p44
aS'Hello.'
p45
aS'My name is John Donvan, and I will be moderating the debate which begins in about four minutes.'
p46
aS'I wanted to have a quick chat with you about a few things relating to primarily your role as members of the audience.'
p47
aS"Normally, we do these debates in New York, and occasionally we go on the road, and it's really a pleasure for us to be here in Chicago."
p48
aS"So I'm going to give you the spiel I give you in New York, which is this: We want you as members of the audience not to consider yourself passive listeners."
p49
aS'We need you to be the opposite of that.'
p50
aS'You actually act as the judges in the debate.'
p51
aS'You choose the winner of the debate.'
p52
aS"And the way we have you do that, if you see at your seats, there's a keypad."
p53
aS'And at the very beginning of the debate, I\'m going to state the motion, "Ration End-Of-Life Care," and, before the debate, you agree with this motion, we want you to register that by pushing number one.'
p54
aS'If you disagree, we want you to push number two.'
p55
aS"And if you're undecided, push number three."
p56
aS'And you can ignore all of the other keys at that point.'
p57
aS'They are not live.'
p58
aS'And if you push a key incorrectly, just correct yourself, and the system will lock in your last vote.'
p59
aS"At the end of the debate, after you've heard the arguments, and we're asking you to keep an open mind through the course of the evening."
p60
aS"After you've really listened to the arguments and listened closely, we're going to ask you to vote again."
p61
aS'And we want to see whose minds have been changed or who came out of undecided to take one of the positions.'
p62
aS'And the team at the end of the evening whose percentage has changed the most according to your vote is going to be declared our winner.'
p63
aS"The second way in which your role is critical as members of the audience is that after a round, a formal round of opening statements by each debater in turn, we will then have a session where it's more mixed up."
p64
aS'They can address each other and take questions from me.'
p65
aS'At that point, I also want to take questions from you.'
p66
aS'And the way that will work is if you just raise your hand, and I find you, just stand up.'
p67
aS'A microphone will be brought to you, and we want you to hold the microphone about this far away from your mouth.'
p68
aS"I'll explain why in a second."
p69
aS'Basically so that we can hear you.'
p70
aS"We'd like you to state your name and then ask a question."
p71
aS'Now, on the question, this does get tricky in New York at least.'
p72
aS"We don't want you to debate with the debaters."
p73
aS"We -- that's what they're here to do."
p74
aS'We want you really to ask a question that will move forward the discussion of this motion.'
p75
aS'What they\'re really here to debate and persuade you on is this short statement: "Ration end-of-life care.'
p76
aS'" So I\'d like you to think in terms of asking a question that focuses on that, not a secondary issue.'
p77
aS"And I'll be fine if you want to make a short, very, very short opening statement of your premise."
p78
aS'But then I want you to get to a question.'
p79
aS"And you'll know that it's a question because if a question mark goes at the end of the statement naturally, then it's going to work."
p80
aS'And I will -- I will respectfully decline questions that are really off topic.'
p81
aS"And I may have to step in and help you phrase your question if you're struggling, but I do follow that very respectfully."
p82
aS'We are being broadcast ultimately on NPR stations, on NPR -- on podcast downloads, on television in New York, not live, but we are live streaming right now as we speak.'
p83
aS'But because of that, a few things you need to know.'
p84
aS'There are certain formalities that we need to observe for the broadcast.'
p85
aS"I'm going to have to tell you many, many times that we're in Chicago and many times that I'm John Donvan."
p86
aS'All things like that come back from the break.'
p87
aS"So just so you know that I haven't lost my bearings, that there's a purpose for that."
p88
aS'Also, a number of times through the evening, given that this is the home of the great program, "Wait, wait, don\'t tell me," whose sound is -- whose live studio sound is just spectacular, we want to hear from you in the evening; feel pleased, to laugh, to laugh, to applaud, to express your dissatisfaction as long as it\'s not in an ugly way.'
p89
aS'You know, a well-placed guffaw is fine.'
p90
aS"We would -- we don't want you shouting out or anything."
p91
aS'And -- but again, really give thought to things.'
p92
aS'And at certain times during the broadcast, during those times, probably just before I introduce myself yet again, I\'m going to raise my hand, and that\'s an obvious signal for, "Can you please give a round of applause?'
p93
aS'" So I know that we don\'t even have to practice that.'
p94
aS"But in the beginning, I'm going to be introducing each of the debaters."
p95
aS'It will be great if you could applaud each of them.'
p96
aS'My hand will be going up for that.'
p97
aS"The last thing, because we're doing a radio broadcast, is we have a lot of microphones placed all over the room."
p98
aS'And cell phones and Blackberries, et cetera, will cause interference with them if it reaches a certain critical mass.'
p99
aS"So we're -- we're fine if you're Tweeting about this."
p100
aS"In fact, we're delighted by that."
p101
aS"If you're live Tweeting, fine, because we don't think there will be enough people doing that to cause problems."
p102
aS"But if you're not using your phone for that purpose, please shut down entirely."
p103
aS"And you don't want it ringing in the middle of the debate and then having that be heard on NPR stations across the station as you stifle your phone."
p104
aS"So that's it."
p105
aS"We're really, really delighted to be here and delighted that we have a full house upstairs and down."
p106
aS"And folks upstairs, I need to tell you that our microphones for questions won't go up there."
p107
aS"But if you make a special trip to come downstairs, and I notice, I'll try very hard to call on you to come into the debate."
p108
aS'So we are put together -- we exist because of an organization called the Rosenkranz Foundation which started Intelligence Squared U.S. with the mission of raising the level of public discourse.'
p109
aS'And to help us now frame what this debate is, I would like to invite to the stage, to the seats out front, the chairman of the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Robert Rosenkranz.'
p110
aS"John Donvan So Bob is just going to talk to us very briefly about what's going to happen here, why we're doing this."
p111
aS"So what's at stake basically, Bob, in this debate?"

p197

p198
aS"In our country, we're spending about 17 percent of GNP on healthcare."
p199
aS'Other rich countries spend about 9 percent.'
p200
aS"And a big driver of that is what's spent in the last year of life."
p201

p203
aS'All of the improvement in productivity and growth over that time has gone to healthcare.'
p204
aS"John Donvan So the side that's arguing for rationing has what going for it as its strongest argument?"
p205
aS'Well, I think the strongest argument simply is that we cannot afford to provide unlimited healthcare, particularly at the end of life, as if it were a free good.'
p206
aS'There has to be a way to bring in under control.'
p207
aS'And either governments or insurance companies have to ration end-of-life care as a policy response.'
p208
aS'John Donvan And the opposite way, the side arguing against rationing.'
p209
aS"The side arguing against would say that healthcare, particularly at the end of life, should be the subject of a discussion between your doctor and your patient and the patient's family."
p210
aS'And the argument against is really summed up in very colorful language.'
p211
aS'No one wants death panels.'
p212

S'As you hear from each of us tonight, I urge you to not only listen to our arguments, but consider our different backgrounds and our different interests.'
p397
aS"Since 2010, I've worked for the RAND Corporation."
p398
aS"RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy questions confronting our country and the world."
p399
aS'RAND analysts are expected to be dispassionate and detached.'
p400
aS'That\'s not a good way to win an "Intelligence Squared" debate.'
p401
aS'So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave.'
p402
aS"And I'm here tonight not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor."
p403
aS"Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying patients in some of our nation's busiest ERs."
p404
aS'The goal of emergency medicine is always to save lives.'
p405
aS'But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants.'
p406
aS'It happens when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness.'
p407
aS"And that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got around to having the conversation."
p408
aS'They never got around to talking with the patient about, "What will they want us to do when they reach that point?'
p409
aS'" So we end up having that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a family conference room or at the bedside.'
p410
aS'Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full- court press.'
p411
aS'Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine, put in IV lines.'
p412
aS"But, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want."
p413
aS'And rather than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying.'
p414
aS'That\'s why when "Intelligence Squared" called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what their family goes through too.'
p415
aS"Now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, I think it's important for us to define just what we mean."
p416
aS'What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about?'
p417
aS'Medical and surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be used.'
p418
aS"Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine."
p419
aS'Many treatments are used to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent, or there was no advanced care planning.'
p420
aS"Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's simply rectifying poor-quality care."
p421
aS"And some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low chance of success."
p422
aS'Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would consider rationing.'
p423
aS'And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about that in a minute.'
p424
aS'But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used often enough.'
p425
aS"It's relatively inexpensive."
p426
aS"It's highly valued by patients."
p427
aS"And it's effective."
p428
aS"It's palliative care."
p429
aS"Palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they can be as they approach the last days of their lives."
p430
aS'Now, two years ago, a group of cancer specialists published an amazing study in the "New England Journal of Medicine.'
p431
aS'" They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer.'
p432
aS'And they randomly assigned them to two treatment groups.'
p433
aS'One treatment group got palliative care and standard cancer treatment.'
p434
aS'The other group got very aggressive, advanced cancer care.'
p435
aS'And they followed the two groups.'
p436
aS'The palliative care group not only had a better quality of life and less depression prior to their death.'
p437
aS'They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment.'
p438
aS'This past August another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life.'
p439
aS'Those that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried.'
p440
aS'Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth.'
p441
aS"So at the outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad medicine."
p442
aS'And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to advocate limiting access to palliative care.'
p443
aS'So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of situations in a highly charged question: Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long as they want?'
p444
aS'Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price.'
p445
aS'Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100 percent.'
p446
aS"So the question is not whether we're going to live or die."
p447
aS"The question is where and how we'll die and who will be with us when we do."
p448
aS"Most of us don't want to die in an intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved ones."
p449
aS"Yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life."
p450
aS'As a physician, my goals are simple: To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect.'

aS'In three ways: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, accountable care organizations and the patient-centered Outcome Research Institute.'
p557
aS'First, IPAB; on October 1, President Obama and Governor Romney spent a lot of time debating the issue of IPAB.'
p558
aS'IPAB will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by the president and approved by the Senate whose job it is to cut Medicare spending.'
p559
aS'It will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on Medicare exceeds the average Consumer Price Index growth rate between 2014 and 2018.'

aS'After that, costs will be tied to GDP growth plus 1 percent.'
p561

p565
aS'They would benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for treating Medicare patients.'
p566

p572
aS'I do think that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care.'
p573
aS'How do we achieve that goal?'
p574
aS'Well, I believe there are two competing visions when it comes to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage.'
p575
aS'One focuses on doctors and patient-centered solutions.'
p576
aS'The other focuses on increasing the role of government in our healthcare system.'
p577
aS"That was President Obama's vision."
p578
aS'Liberal politicians, academics and the elite media tell Americans that socialized assistance such as exists in Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all.'

S'Thank you very much.'
p670
aS"It's the position of our side that we are already rationing health care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so."
p671
aS'The question that we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we\'re doing, and, therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially means, "Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we\'re spending now," or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don\'t bring out in the open so we cover up, that we don\'t really dare to discuss.'
p672
aS"And we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly, and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the money we're spending effectively."
p673
aS"Now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at present."
p674
aS'We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross national product, on health care.'
p675
aS"That's about 50 percent more than other comparable countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with."
p676
aS"There is no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we're spending, than those other countries."
p677
aS'And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks.'
p678
aS"When we looked at not just what the health system does but at health outcomes in America, we're actually terrible."
p679
aS"It's the combination of what the health system does and our general health."
p680
aS'We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like Slovenia and Costa Rica.'
p681
aS'They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet their health outcomes are comparable to ours.'
p682
aS'And the other industrialized nations have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada.'
p683
aS'It\'s also true -- it\'s also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just coincidentally the same number, say, "Yes," they do.'
p684
aS'When you asked Americans, only 56 percent of them say they do.'
p685
aS"I think that there's a general feeling that this health care system is not delivering what we want."
p686
aS'But as I said it is rationing.'
p687
aS'It rations in many ways.'
p688
aS'For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not insured at all.'
p689
aS'That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect, but it will not unfortunately drop to zero.'
p690
aS'Now, not being insured means that you are more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident.'
p691
aS'In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road accidents, seriously injured.'
p692
aS'And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for other variables than those who had insurance.'
p693
aS"And when he calculated how much it would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000."
p694
aS'Reasonable amount of money.'
p695
aS'But that was how much more was spent on saving the lives of the others.'
p696
aS'But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about $5,500.'
p697
aS"These people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each year of life that we could have saved."
p698
aS'Compare that with the amount that those much criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom.'
p699
aS'What they say is too much to spend.'
p700
aS'Apparently, NICEs figure is around $49,000.'
p701
aS'In other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these young accident victims.'
p702
aS"And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because some people can't afford copayments."
p703
aS'We have long waiting times.'
p704
aS"We don't pay doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don't take Medicare patients, or they don't take so many Medicare patients."
p705
aS"So we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we could save quite cheaply."
p706
aS'So I think we ought to be more explicit about this.'
p707
aS'We ought to be prepared to say, "Let\'s use the dollars --" maybe we should spend more dollars.'
p708
aS"I'm not necessarily opposed to spending more dollars."
p709
aS"But let's use the dollars we spend in the most effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives."
p710
aS'Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than the economy is growing.'
p711
aS"They're rising at 9.8 percent per annum."
p712
aS'We all know the economy is not growing at anything like that amount.'
p713
aS"So as that keeps happening, what's going to happen?"
p714
aS'It will eventually soak up all available spending.'
p715
aS'But we know the government has to spend on other things.'
p716
aS'On the website, in the articles that were posted.'
p717
aS"There's a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the demographic changes, there's going to be more of them."
p718
aS'Effectively, we need to spend a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no longer look after themselves.'
p719
aS"That costs money, and it's going to cost more money."
p720
aS'We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important things that we need.'
p721
aS'So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care.'
p722
aS'We are arguing that, indeed, we should.'
p723
aS"That's obvious."
p724
aS'But whether we should be more explicit about it, because we want to get the best results we can.'
p725
aS'We want to save the most number of lives that we can.'
p726

aS'Sally Pipes\' mother\'s situation is exhibit "A" for why Americans don\'t want the government to wind up rationing health care in this country.'
p813
aS"By contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an older age than Sally's mom."
p814
aS'She received aggressive treatment, both surgery and chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed.'
p815
aS'Which system would you prefer?'
p816
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make three points, if I may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care."
p817
aS'First of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by bureaucrats at a remote location.'
p818
aS'Secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying.'
p819
aS"Thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way -- lazy man's attempt to balance the budget."
p820
aS"It's easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands of the special interests at home and abroad."
p821
aS'So back to the premises, first of all, that healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside.'
p822
aS"Americans don't want bureaucratic bean counters in Washington making decisions about what kind of care they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life."
p823
aS'Decisions about healthcare and how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families.'
p824
aS'Decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given patient should take into account the needs of the patient.'
p825
aS'In other words, healthcare should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient.'
p826
aS'A bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of individualized decisions that are required.'
p827
aS'These are decisions that have to be based real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning as Dr. Kellermann has pointed out.'
p828
aS"And it's the people who have their feet on their floor -- on the floor in the hospital and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions."
p829
aS"There's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine in Washington can make those kinds of decisions."
p830
aS'Healthcare requires the fine edge of a scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax.'
p831
aS"And patients don't want their doctors straight- jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city."
p832
aS'They want decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account.'
p833
aS"They don't some interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in Washington, in a room that was predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions."
p834
aS'And, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in Washington to be making these kinds of decisions?'
p835
aS'Should cost be the primary driver of such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in Washington?'
p836
aS"I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort."
p837
aS'Now, no one is suggesting for a moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources.'
p838
aS'We absolutely should be.'
p839
aS'But rationing is not what we need.'
p840
aS"It's rational care."
p841
aS'We ought to be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient?'
p842
aS'Is it clinically appropriate?'
p843
aS'Is the cost reasonable compared to similar services?'
p844
aS'These are questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the hospital in real time by hospitalization -- hospital utilization committees and not by people who are removed from the bedside.'
p845
aS'Now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former Colorado governor Richard Lamb who said, "The elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way.'
p846
aS'" This philosophy sees the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now costs more to maintain than they produce.'
p847
aS'They reject the sanctity of life ethics that has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious and out to be respected and protected under the law.'
p848
aS'That view affirms equal protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old.'
p849
aS'Instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies.'
p850
aS"Of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability don't score well using those formulas."
p851
aS"And isn't that the point?"
p852
aS'Ladies and gentlemen, what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of life?'
p853
aS'Will they be any more successful than they were in picking Solindra and Bright Source and Abound Solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars?'
p854
aS'But then again, what does it matter?'
p855
aS"At the end of life, we're all going to die, right?"
p856
aS'Folks, I would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying.'
p857
aS"For heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the Wall Street bailout to rescue businesses that engaged in profligate spending practices."
p858
aS'Surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick and the dying.'
p859
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the proposition because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did."
p860
aS'Thank you.'
p861
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Ken Connor.'
p862
aS'That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.'
p863
aS"John Donvan Now we'll have the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience, we have two teams of two."
p864
aS'Arthur Kellermann and Peter Singer are arguing for the motion: "Ration end-of-life care.'
p865
aS'" And we have heard them say basically that we already are rationing, that healthcare is rationed right now by the ability to pay for it by the individual and that it is time to be explicit, to ration in a different way, to step up and admit that\'s what we\'re doing and figure out a system for doing it.'
p866
aS'They say that you need to figure out how much saving a life produces in terms of results.'
p867
aS'You have to compare that to how the resources could be used elsewhere.'
p868
aS'The team arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes and Ken Connor, argue that rationing end- of-life care is the wrong way to balance the budget.'
p869
aS'They say that it would be falling to government bureaucrats to make intensely personal decisions, that cost should not be the driver of a decision regarding the end of life, and that they depict a future where basically the elderly will be thrown overboard.'
p870
aS'Now, I notice that the two sides do agree that cost cutting needs to happen, that costs are out of control.'
p871
aS'They do agree that ideally these decisions will be made at the bedside by doctors and their families.'
p872
aS'The question is, who ends up controlling where the money comes from.'
p873
aS'And I want to put to the side arguing in support of rationing end-of-life care, particularly to Peter Singer, this basic question: Is there a way actually to arrive at a dollar value for what a few more months of life would be worth to an elderly person versus what it would be worth to a younger person?'
p874
aS'And does that explain whether -- does that price carry over to whether a procedure is worth pursuing or not?'
p875
aS'Can you put a dollar number on these things?'

aS'The question is "Where do we wind up striking the balance?'
p2744
aS'" And Ican tell you to Peters point that care in our nursing homes in America is America\'s dirtysecret.And it\'s in part because a -- real estate investors pose as health care providers.'
p2745
aS"And thegovernment doesn't adequately regulate them, plain and simple."
p2746
aS'And we have aabsolute scourge of preventable bedsores, and avoidable malnutrition, and dehydration,falls, and avoidable infections.'
p2747
aS"But let me say this, I think it's important to understandthat rationing is not required in order for the health care system to remain solvent."
p2748
aS"Thatassumes the fallacy of only one alternative, that either we ration or we're going to gobroke."
p2749
aS"That's not true."

S'Most Western democracies have health care systems that provide you with all the care you need, whether or not you can afford it.'
p2776
aS'Our health care system has evolved to provide you with all the health care you can afford, whether or not you need it.'
p2777
aS"Modern American medicine is a $2.8 trillion a year industry, and it is rapidly outgrowing our economy's capacity to support it."
p2778
aS'More high tech care is not necessarily better care.'
p2779
aS'Sometimes the basics, pain control, bedside attention, love, matter a lot more than the most sophisticated $100,000 medicines there are.'
p2780
aS"That's why, when terminally ill patients came into my ER, I did not immediately incubate, immediately start multiple IVs, immediately do anything I didn't absolutely have to do."
p2781
aS'I stabilized the patient the best I could, I assessed the situation, and I talked to the patient.'
p2782
aS'If they were able to communicate or not, I would bring the proxy -- the son, the daughter of, a brother, the spouse to the bedside.'
p2783
aS'Let me tell you what happened one night as an example.'
p2784
aS'I brought a daughter who had cared for her mother for 10 years to the bedside, and I said, "Your mom has severe pneumonia.'
p2785
aS"She's septic."
p2786
aS"This is the third time she's been in the hospital in the last two months."
p2787
aS'We can do everything we know to do, and she will almost certainly die, but she might pull through.'
p2788
aS"And the best we can hope for is she'll be the way she was a week ago when she didn't recognize you and was in the nursing home."
p2789
aS"So my question to you is not 'What do you want us to do?"
p2790
aS"' I know what you want us to do."
p2791
aS'You want us to make your mother the way she used to be.'
p2792
aS"I can't do that."
p2793
aS"So I want to ask you, 'What would your mother want if she came back now and stood next to you?"
p2794
aS'\'" And she said, "Mama would say, \'It\'s time.'
p2795
aS'\'" As you vote tonight, I ask you to consider what kind of doctor do you want to take care of your mother, and what kind of doctor will you want to take care of you, and that should guide your vote.'
p2796
aS'John Donvan Thank you, Art Kellermann.'
p2797
aS"We're going to have the second vote now."
p2798
aS'So if you go to the keypads in your seat.'
p2799
aS'After hearing everything, we want to know where you stand, whether you have been persuaded to one side or the other.'
p2800
aS'If you agree with the motion, "Ration end-of-life care," the side argued by this team, push number one.'
p2801
aS'If you disagree with the motion, with this team, push number two.'
p2802
aS'And if you are or became undecided, push number three.'
p2803
aS'And you can ignore all of the other keys.'
p2804
aS'And they will lock in pretty quickly, actually.'
p2805
aS"We'll have the vote probably in about a minute and 45 seconds."
p2806
aS"And so, while we're waiting, a few things that I want to say."
p2807
aS"First of all, ma'am, if we're lucky enough to be invited back next year, you find me at the beginning of the debate."
p2808
aS'I owe you the first question.'
p2809
aS'Okay?'
p2810
aS'All right.'
p2811
aS"And everybody else who stood up and asked questions, including the ones that we didn't get to use, it takes a lot of guts to stand up, and a lot of the questions were great, actually."
p2812
aS'I want to thank all of you for doing that.'
p2813
aS'I also want to thank, despite what I would professionally consider a little bit of meandering in the middle, I think we got into some very important places in this debate where the clash was head-on.'
p2814
aS"We could see the values represented by both of these sides, because he doesn't actually have to think in real time."
p2815
aS"That's a very impressive thing to see happen."
p2816
aS"It's difficult to do."
p2817
aS"I want to thank this panel for what they've brought here to this stage."
p2818
aS"It's really been a pleasure to be part of Chicago Ideas Week and to be in the city at all."
p2819
aS"You actually are a very, very lively audience, and you're going to sound great on the radio."
p2820
aS'Afterwards, after the debate, we would be delighted, of course, to have you tweet about the debate.'
p2821
aS'Our Twitter handle is @IQ2US, and the hashtag is the same, #IQ2US.'
p2822
aS'I want to thank the CIW team, in particular I want to name some people.'
p2823
aS'Brad Keywell, Carrie Kennedy, and Jessica Malkin who, again, was very instrumental in getting us on this stage.'
p2824
aS'Our next debate is Wednesday, October 24th.'
p2825
aS'It will be held in New York City.'
p2826
aS'And the motion in this date is, "The rich are taxed enough.'
p2827
aS'" In support of the motion, we have Glen Hubbard, is currently dean of the Columbia Business School.'
p2828
aS'He is also an economic advisor to presidential candidate Mitt Romney.'
p2829
aS'His partner is Art Laffer, who is known as the father of supply side economics, the famous Laffer curve is his curve.'
p2830
aS"He was a member of President Reagan's economic policy advisory board."
p2831
aS"He's debated with us before, and he's actually very -- not only smart, he's very witty."
p2832
aS'He keeps everybody laughing.'
p2833
aS'Against this motion, "The rich are taxed enough," we have Robert Reich, who is former secretary of labor in the Clinton Administration and professor at the University of California in Berkeley, and Mark Zandi, who is one of the most widely followed economic forecasters and the chief economist of Moody\'s Analytics.'
p2834
aS'So, all right.'
p2835
aS'The results are being walked up.'
p2836
aS'So, remember, we had you vote -- This never happens in New York.'
p2837
aS'That was very generous.'
p2838
aS'Our motion is, "Ration end- of-life care.'
p2839
aS'" We now have the results in on your votes.'
p2840
aS'Remember, we had you vote before you heard the argument and once again after hearing the arguments, and the team who has changed your numbers the most, who has moved you to their side by the largest percentage, will be declared our winners.'
p2841
aS'So here is how it breaks out.'
p2842
aS'Before the debate, 43 percent were for the motion, 22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided.'
p2843
aS"After the debate, 38 percent are for the motion -- I'm sorry."
p2844
aS'After the debate, 81 percent are for the motion, up 38 percent; 12 percent are against it, down 10 percent; 7 percent are undecided.'
p2845
aS'The side arguing for the motion carries the debate.'
p2846
aS'Our congratulations to them.'
