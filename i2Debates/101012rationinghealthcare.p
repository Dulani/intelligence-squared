S'Good evening, everyone. Hi. Hello. My name is John Donvan, and I will be moderating'
p42
aS'the debate which begins in about four minutes. I wanted to have a quick chat with you'
p43
aS'about a few things relating to primarily your role as members of the audience.'
p44
aS' Normally, we do these debates in New York, and occasionally we go on the road, and'
p45
aS"it's really a pleasure for us to be here in Chicago. So I'm going to give you the spiel I give"
p46
aS'you in New York, which is this: We want you as members of the audience not to'
p47
aS'consider yourself passive listeners. We need you to be the opposite of that. You'
p48
aS'actually act as the judges in the debate. You choose the winner of the debate. And the'
p49
aS"way we have you do that, if you see at your seats, there's a keypad. And at the very"
p50
aS'beginning of the debate, I\'m going to state the motion, "Ration End-Of-Life Care," and,'
p51
aS'before the debate, you agree with this motion, we want you to register that by pushing'
p52
aS'number one. If you disagree, we want you to push number two.'
p53
aS"And if you're undecided, push number three. And you can ignore all of the other keys at"
p54
aS'that point. They are not live. And if you push a key incorrectly, just correct yourself,'
p55
aS"and the system will lock in your last vote. At the end of the debate, after you've heard"
p56
aS"the arguments, and we're asking you to keep an open mind through the course of the"
p57
aS"evening. After you've really listened to the arguments and listened closely, we're going"
p58
aS'to ask you to vote again. And we want to see whose minds have been changed or who'
p59
aS'came out of undecided to take one of the positions. And the team at the end of the'
p60
aS'evening whose percentage has changed the most according to your vote is going to be'
p61
aS'declared our winner.'
p62
aS'The second way in which your role is critical as members of the audience is that after a'
p63
aS'round, a formal round of opening statements by each debater in turn, we will then have'
p64
aS"a session where it's more mixed up. They can address each other and take questions"
p65
aS'from me. At that point, I also want to take questions from you. And the way that will'
p66
aS'work is if you just raise your hand, and I find you, just stand up.'
p67
aS'A microphone will be brought to you, and we want you to hold the microphone about'
p68
aS"this far away from your mouth. I'll explain why in a second. Basically so that we can"
p69
aS"hear you. We'd like you to state your name and then ask a question. Now, on the"
p70
aS"question, this does get tricky in New York at least. We don't want you to debate with"
p71
aS"the debaters. We -- that's what they're here to do. We want you really to ask a"
p72
aS"question that will move forward the discussion of this motion. What they're really here"
p73
aS'to debate and persuade you on is this short statement: "Ration end-of-life care." So I\'d'
p74
aS'like you to think in terms of asking a question that focuses on that, not a secondary'
p75
aS"issue. And I'll be fine if you want to make a short, very, very short opening statement of"
p76
aS"your premise. But then I want you to get to a question. And you'll know that it's a"
p77
aS"question because if a question mark goes at the end of the statement naturally, then it's"
p78
aS'going to work. And I will -- I will respectfully decline questions that are really off topic.'
p79
aS"And I may have to step in and help you phrase your question if you're struggling, but I"
p80
aS'do follow that very respectfully. We are being broadcast ultimately on NPR stations, on'
p81
aS'NPR -- on podcast downloads, on television in New York, not live, but we are live'
p82
aS'streaming right now as we speak. But because of that, a few things you need to know.'
p83
aS" There are certain formalities that we need to observe for the broadcast. I'm going to"
p84
aS"have to tell you many, many times that we're in Chicago and many times that I'm John"
p85
aS'Donvan. All things like that come back from the break. So just so you know that I'
p86
aS"haven't lost my bearings, that there's a purpose for that."
p87
aS'Also, a number of times through the evening, given that this is the home of the great'
p88
aS'program, "Wait, wait, don\'t tell me," whose sound is -- whose live studio sound is just'
p89
aS'spectacular, we want to hear from you in the evening; feel pleased, to laugh, to laugh,'
p90
aS"to applaud, to express your dissatisfaction as long as it's not in an ugly way."
p91
aS"You know, a well-placed guffaw is fine. We would -- we don't want you shouting out or"
p92
aS'anything. And -- but again, really give thought to things. And at certain times during the'
p93
aS"broadcast, during those times, probably just before I introduce myself yet again, I'm"
p94
aS'going to raise my hand, and that\'s an obvious signal for, "Can you please give a round of'
p95
aS'applause?" So I know that we don\'t even have to practice that. But in the beginning,'
p96
aS"I'm going to be introducing each of the debaters. It will be great if you could applaud"
p97
aS'each of them. My hand will be going up for that.'
p98
aS"The last thing, because we're doing a radio broadcast, is we have a lot of microphones"
p99
aS'placed all over the room. And cell phones and Blackberries, et cetera, will cause'
p100
aS"interference with them if it reaches a certain critical mass. So we're -- we're fine if"
p101
aS"you're Tweeting about this. In fact, we're delighted by that. If you're live Tweeting,"
p102
aS"fine, because we don't think there will be enough people doing that to cause problems."
p103
aS"But if you're not using your phone for that purpose, please shut down entirely. And you"
p104
aS"don't want it ringing in the middle of the debate and then having that be heard on NPR"
p105
aS"stations across the station as you stifle your phone. So that's it. We're really, really"
p106
aS'delighted to be here and delighted that we have a full house upstairs and down. And'
p107
aS"folks upstairs, I need to tell you that our microphones for questions won't go up there."
p108
aS" But if you make a special trip to come downstairs, and I notice, I'll try very hard to call"
p109
aS'on you to come into the debate. So we are put together -- we exist because of an'
p110
aS'organization called the Rosenkranz Foundation which started Intelligence Squared U.S.'
p111
aS'with the mission of raising the level of public discourse. And to help us now frame what'
p112
aS'this debate is, I would like to invite to the stage, to the seats out front, the chairman of'
p113
aS'the board of Intelligence Squared U.S., Robert Rosenkranz.'
p114
aS'John Donvan'
p115
aS"So Bob is just going to talk to us very briefly about what's going to happen here, why"

S"Well, this is one of the most intense emotional kinds of issues that we've ever debated."
p139
aS' It raises all kinds of questions about ethics, but it also raises huge public policy'
p140
aS"questions. In our country, we're spending about 17 percent of GNP on healthcare."
p141
aS" Other rich countries spend about 9 percent. And a big driver of that is what's spent in"
p142
aS'the last year of life. And so like 30 percent of all Medicare expenditures are in the final'
p143
aS'year of life. And this is frankly driving the huge government deficits that all of us are'
p144
aS"worried about, and it also, when it gets down to the level of the individual family, it's"
p145
aS'kind of why families in America have seen no increase in their real incomes over the last'
p146
aS'decade.'
p147
aS'All of the improvement in productivity and growth over that time has gone to'
p148
aS'healthcare.'
p149
aS'John Donvan'
p150
aS"So the side that's arguing for rationing has what going for it as its strongest argument?"
p151
aS'Well, I think the strongest argument simply is that we cannot afford to provide'
p152
aS'unlimited healthcare, particularly at the end of life, as if it were a free good. There has'
p153
aS'to be a way to bring in under control. And either governments or insurance companies'
p154
aS'have to ration end-of-life care as a policy response.'
p155
aS'John Donvan'
p156
aS'And the opposite way, the side arguing against rationing.'
p157
aS'The side arguing against would say that healthcare, particularly at the end of life, should'
p158
aS"be the subject of a discussion between your doctor and your patient and the patient's"
p159
aS'family. And the argument against is really summed up in very colorful language. No one'
p160
aS'wants death panels.'
p161
aS'John Donvan'
p162
aS'And why this debate now?'
p163
aS'Well, I think the answer is the presidential debate. This is one of the critical national'
p164
aS"issues. And I expect, because it's such an emotionally difficult issue, it is not going to be"
p165
aS'debated forthrightly in the presidential debates. So I thought this was a good'
p166
aS'opportunity to do it.'
p167
aS'John Donvan'
p168
aS"So we'll do it here. Thank you, Bob. And so that is the shape of this debate. And let's"
p169

p170
aS'John Donvan'
p171

p173
aS'John Donvan'
p174
aS"Yes or no to this statement: End-of-life care, we can't afford to keep every elderly"
p175
aS"person alive, so we're going to have to ration it. Is that right, or is that wrong? Well,"
p176
aS"since probably all of us at some point want to have our crack at it, when it's our turn,"
p177
aS"but probably all of us in the meantime, we're going to have to pay for it for everybody"
p178
aS"else, and since there really are two serious sides to this argument, then let's make a"
p179
aS"debate of it. I'm John Donvan, a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We are in"
p180
aS'Chicago, Chicago Ideas Week. It is a pleasure to be here.'
p181
aS'The motion that\'s on the table, "Ration End-of-Life Care." We have four superbly'
p182
aS'qualified debaters, two against two, who will be arguing for and against this motion.'
p183

p184
aS'only one side wins. On the side arguing for the motion, "Ration End-of-Life Care,"'

p279
aS'to one, two, and three.'
p280

aS'life care," push number two. And if you are undecided at this point, push number three.'
p284
aS' My guess is that the undecideds are who these debaters are really fighting for, but not'
p285
aS'necessarily. We have had a lot of debates where people said that they listened so'
p286
aS'closely that their minds are actually changed because the arguments were so good.'
p287
aS"So we're going to lock that out now. And again, at the end of the debate, we'll have you"

aS'vote a second time, and the team whose numbers have changed most as a percentage'

p311
aS"consider our different backgrounds and our different interests. Since 2010, I've worked"
p312
aS'for the RAND Corporation. RAND is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research'
p313
aS"organization that's dedicated to objective analysis of some of the toughest policy"

aS'questions confronting our country and the world. RAND analysts are expected to be'
p315

p316

p317
aS"So this morning I advised RAND I was taking a day of annual leave. And I'm here tonight"
p318
aS'not as a RAND analyst but as an ER doctor.'
p319
aS'Who, as John said, worked for 25 years taking care of severely ill, injured, and dying'
p320
aS"patients in some of our nation's busiest ERs. The goal of emergency medicine is always"
p321
aS'to save lives. But you would be surprised how often we have to make decisions in'
p322
aS'consultation with patients and their families about whether or not initiating heroic'
p323
aS'measures is, in fact, the right thing to do and what the patient really wants. It happens'
p324
aS'when a critically ill patient is rushed to the ER in the very last stages of a terminal illness.'
p325
aS" And that usually happens when the patient's personal physician, well, they never got"
p326
aS'around to having the conversation. They never got around to talking with the patient'
p327
aS'about, "What will they want us to do when they reach that point?" So we end up having'
p328
aS'that conversation with the patient or with their loved ones at 2:00 in the morning in a'
p329
aS'family conference room or at the bedside.'
p330
aS'Now, from a medical or a business perspective, the easiest thing to do, by far, is just full-'
p331
aS'court press. Start resuscitation, incubate the patient, roll out the breathing machine,'
p332
aS"put in IV lines. But, you know, it doesn't always accomplish what we want. And rather"
p333
aS"than prolonging life, it simply prolongs the process of dying. That's why when"
p334
aS'"Intelligence Squared" called me and asked if I would do this debate tonight, my answer'
p335
aS'was an immediate yes, not only because of what the patient goes through, but what'
p336
aS'their family goes through too.'
p337
aS"Now, to clarify what we're debating tonight, I think it's important for us to define just"
p338
aS'what we mean. What kind of end-of-life care are we talking about? Medical and'
p339
aS'surgical treatments that do not achieve a reasonable goal of medicine should not be'
p340
aS'used.'
p341
aS"Limiting this type of care is not rationing; it's good medicine. Many treatments are used"
p342
aS'to achieve goals that patients did not want or were not proportionate to the burdens'
p343
aS'that the treatment imposed, because there was either ineffective communication about'
p344
aS'the disease prognosis, there is a failure to achieve adequate informed patient consent,'
p345
aS"or there was no advanced care planning. Avoiding these treatments is not rationing; it's"
p346
aS'simply rectifying poor-quality care.'
p347
aS"And some treatments are deserved, but they're extremely costly and have a very low"
p348
aS'chance of success. Declining to pay for such treatments is what most people would'
p349
aS'consider rationing. And my teammate, Professor Singer, will have more to say about'
p350
aS'that in a minute. But I do think there is one type of end-of-life care that is not used'
p351
aS'often enough.'
p352
aS"It's relatively inexpensive. It's highly valued by patients. And it's effective. It's palliative"
p353
aS"care. Palliative care is specialized care that's focused on relieving pain, relieving the"
p354
aS'burden of symptoms, helping the patient to be as comfortable and as functional as they'
p355
aS'can be as they approach the last days of their lives. Now, two years ago, a group of'
p356
aS'cancer specialists published an amazing study in the "New England Journal of Medicine."'
p357
aS' They took a group of patients with a very serious type of lung cancer. And they'
p358
aS'randomly assigned them to two treatment groups. One treatment group got palliative'
p359
aS'care and standard cancer treatment. The other group got very aggressive, advanced'
p360
aS'cancer care. And they followed the two groups. The palliative care group not only had a'
p361
aS'better quality of life and less depression prior to their death.'
p362
aS'They lived longer than the group that got aggressive treatment. This past August'
p363
aS'another team followed nearly 400 cancer patients during their last months in life. Those'
p364
aS'that avoided hospitalization and avoided the intensive care unit were less worried.'
p365
aS' Those who prayed or meditated, those who were visited by their pastor in the hospital'
p366
aS'or in clinic, those who felt they had a strong bond with their doctors were happier, had'
p367
aS'higher quality of life and did better in the last days that they had on this earth. So at the'
p368
aS"outset of this debate, let's assume that our opponents did not come here to defend bad"
p369
aS'medicine. And you can be confident that Professor Singer and I did not come here to'
p370
aS'advocate limiting access to palliative care. So that leaves us with a pretty narrow set of'
p371
aS'situations in a highly charged question: Do patients in the last stages of terminal illness'
p372
aS'have an unqualified right to extremely costly treatments of uncertain value for as long'
p373
aS'as they want?'
p374
aS'Because if the answer is yes, the rest of us have to be prepared to pay the price.'
p375
aS' Despite remarkable progress of medical science, the global death rate is still 100'
p376
aS'percent.'
p377
aS"So the question is not whether we're going to live or die. The question is where and"
p378
aS"how we'll die and who will be with us when we do. Most of us don't want to die in an"
p379
aS'intensive care unit strapped to a bed under fluorescent lights separated from our loved'
p380
aS"ones. Yet that's precisely what happens to too many of us because all too often our"
p381
aS'healthcare system is too focused on making money, too preoccupied with its technical'
p382
aS'prowess and too busy to sit down with a patient and have an honest, thoughtful, candid'
p383
aS"conversation about prognosis and the patient's wishes at the end of life. As a physician,"
p384
aS'my goals are simple: To save as many lives as I can, to ease pain and suffering when I'
p385
aS'cannot, and always, always treat my patients with compassion and respect.'
p386
aS"That's why at the end of this evening I urge you to vote for the proposition. Thank you."

S'Thank you, John. And I am against the proposition that we should ration end-of-life'
p411
aS"care. My mother was Canadian and a senior. In July of '05, she felt she had colon"
p412
aS'cancer. Her primary care doctor said she did not because he did an X-ray and no cancer'
p413
aS'showed up.'
p414
aS'Well, we all know that colon cancer is not detected by an X-ray but by a colonoscopy.'
p415
aS' But she could not get one in Canada because of her age and the fact that a waiting list'
p416
aS'for people under 65 with colon cancer symptoms was over six months. So by late'
p417
aS'November, my mother was hemorrhaging and had lost 35 pounds. She knew she was ill,'
p418
aS'and she went to the hospital in an ambulance and went to the emergency room, spent'
p419
aS'two days in the transit lounge. Then she did get her colonoscopy. But sadly, she passed'
p420
aS'away two weeks later from metastasized colon cancer. This is the outcome when'
p421
aS'government bureaucrats set the rules for who is going to get care and when. This is'
p422
aS'rationed care and what will face seniors in America if the Affordable Care Act is not'
p423
aS'repealed and replaced.'
p424
aS'Rationing care at the end of life may be a sound solution in the abstract. But when it'
p425
aS'comes to your mother, your father or your child who has a terminal illness, it is wrong'
p426
aS'for social engineers and government bureaucrats to make these life decisions for you.'
p427
aS'In Canada where I grew up, the government spends 11.4 percent of gross domestic'
p428
aS'product on healthcare. And private health insurance is outlawed. The government sets'
p429
aS'a global budget, the one that government can afford. The demand for healthcare is'
p430
aS'much greater than the supply. As a result, Canadians spend -- and they have long'
p431
aS'waiting lists, rationed care and lack of access to the latest treatments. 17 percent of'
p432
aS'Canadians are waiting to get a primary care doctor. In 2011, 940,000 Canadians were'
p433
aS'on a waiting list waiting for treatment. The average wait in 2011 from seeing a primary'
p434
aS'care doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was 19 weeks, up from 18.2 weeks the'
p435
aS'year before.'
p436
aS'In the case of my own mother, it may have shortened her life, but it was definitely'
p437
aS'cheaper for the government. In the case of my mother, it may have shortened her life.'
p438
aS' But colon cancer is one of the most common diseases among our seniors. A study'
p439
aS'published in the British journal Lancet Oncology, suggests that America is one of the'
p440
aS'best countries for treating cancer and survival rates five years after diagnosis for 13 of'
p441
aS'the 16 most common cancers. Do we want to change this outcome by controlling'
p442
aS'healthcare costs through rationed care? For example breast cancer survival rates'
p443
aS"among American women is 83.5 percent, whereas in Britain, it's only 70 percent."
p444
aS' Prostate cancer, survival rate 92 percent in the U.S., only 51 percent in Britain.'
p445
aS'So how will the Affordable Care Act ration care for our seniors and in particular those in'
p446
aS'need of healthcare? In three ways: The Independent Payment Advisory Board,'
p447
aS'accountable care organizations and the patient-centered Outcome Research Institute.'
p448
aS' First, IPAB; on October 1, President Obama and Governor Romney spent a lot of time'
p449
aS'debating the issue of IPAB. IPAB will be a panel of 15 unelected members appointed by'
p450
aS'the president and approved by the Senate whose job it is to cut Medicare spending. It'
p451
aS'will go into effect when federal spending by doctors and hospitals on Medicare exceeds'
p452
aS'the average Consumer Price Index growth rate between 2014 and 2018. After that,'
p453
aS'costs will be tied to GDP growth plus 1 percent.'
p454
aS'The board must propose spending cuts. Congress could overrule the board, but only if it'
p455
aS'has a 3/5 majority in the Senate and the House or comes up with another plan to reduce'
p456
aS'costs. The accountable care organization is second. They are delivery models for'
p457
aS'doctors and hospitals to give them financial incentives to provide good quality'
p458
aS'coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries while keeping costs down. They would'
p459
aS'benefit by sharing in savings with the government if costs are lower than projected for'
p460
aS'treating Medicare patients. If higher, ACOs would have to pay back funds to the'
p461
aS'government. It is my belief that doctors and hospitals will ration or deny care to seniors'
p462
aS'if they feel that their costs would exceed the ceiling. ACOs are a giant HMO.'
p463
aS'Third is the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). It is similar to NICE'
p464
aS'in the UK, a government agency that determines which treatments are cost effective as'
p465
aS'compared to medically effective.'
p466
aS'While no one can deny that there are problems in American healthcare, a system that'
p467
aS'empowers doctors and patients will solve them, not the federal government. I do think'
p468
aS'that everyone here would agree we all want affordable, acceptable quality care. How'
p469
aS'do we achieve that goal? Well, I believe there are two competing visions when it comes'
p470
aS'to healthcare reform and achieving universal coverage. One focuses on doctors and'
p471
aS'patient-centered solutions. The other focuses on increasing the role of government in'
p472
aS"our healthcare system. That was President Obama's vision. Liberal politicians,"
p473
aS'academics and the elite media tell Americans that socialized assistance such as exists in'
p474
aS'Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all.'
p475
aS'And while it is true that 5 percent or 2.5 million seniors in their last year of life consume'
p476
aS"25 percent of Medicare spending, it is still my belief it is not the government's place to"
p477
aS'limit costs by sacrificing lives. End-of-life decisions should be made by doctors and'
p478
aS'families, not bureaucrats such as those on IPAB and PCORI. They will ration the care our'
p479
aS'seniors receive, and I believe that is ethically and morally wrong. In my view, people'
p480
aS'have every right to live as long as they can. Therefore, I urge you to vote against the'
p481
aS'proposition. Thank you.'
p482
aS'John Donvan'
p483
aS'Thank you, Sally Pipes.'

S"Thank you very much. It's the position of our side that we are already rationing health"
p511
aS"care, so in a sense we can't really debate whether we should do so. The question that"
p512
aS"we can discuss is whether we should be open and explicit about what we're doing, and,"
p513
aS'therefore, try to do it in the best, most thought-out way possible, which essentially'
p514
aS'means, "Do it in the way that gets the best value for the health dollars that we\'re'
p515
aS'spending now," or whether we should continue to do it in a way that we don\'t bring out'
p516
aS"in the open so we cover up, that we don't really dare to discuss."
p517
aS"And we can see that politically it's not really a topic that people dare to discuss openly,"
p518
aS'and as a result, more people will die who could be saved than will die if we use the'
p519
aS"money we're spending effectively."
p520
aS"Now, it's clear that we are not spending our health dollars effectively in this country at"
p521
aS'present. We spend about between 17 to 18 percent of everything we have, of our gross'
p522
aS"national product, on health care. That's about 50 percent more than other comparable"
p523
aS'countries, the other industrialized countries that we compare ourselves with. There is'
p524
aS'no evidence, no evidence that we get any better outcomes for the extra 50 percent that'
p525
aS"we're spending, the extra 7 or 8 percent of GDP that we're spending, than those other"
p526
aS'countries.'
p527
aS'And Dr. Kellermann will give you a more detailed rebuttal to what Sally Pipes just said'
p528
aS'when she specifically focused on cancer in those remarks. When we looked at not just'
p529
aS"what the health system does but at health outcomes in America, we're actually"
p530
aS"terrible. It's the combination of what the health system does and our general health."
p531
aS' We rank in terms of health outcomes somewhere around the level of countries like'
p532
aS'Slovenia and Costa Rica. They are countries that are much poorer than we are, and yet'
p533
aS'their health outcomes are comparable to ours. And the other industrialized nations'
p534
aS'have better health outcomes, including, incidentally, Canada.'
p535
aS"It's also true -- it's also true that when you ask Canadians, as Gallop did a couple of years"
p536
aS'ago, and Americans, and Britons, people in the U.K., do they have confidence in their'
p537
aS'health care system, the Britons and the Canadians, 73 percent of them, just'
p538
aS'coincidentally the same number, say, "Yes," they do. When you asked Americans, only'
p539
aS"56 percent of them say they do. I think that there's a general feeling that this health"
p540
aS'care system is not delivering what we want. But as I said it is rationing. It rations in'
p541
aS'many ways. For example, we about 44 million people, Americans, now, who are not'
p542
aS'insured at all. That number will drop significantly when Obama Care comes into effect,'
p543
aS'but it will not unfortunately drop to zero. Now, not being insured means that you are'
p544
aS'more likely to die if you have a serious illness or accident. In fact, Joseph Doyle, a MIT'
p545
aS'scientist, looked at people who were brought into emergency care as a result of road'
p546
aS'accidents, seriously injured.'
p547
aS'And found that those who were uninsured died at a higher rate even when adjusting for'
p548
aS'other variables than those who had insurance. And when he calculated how much it'
p549
aS"would have cost to save these people's lives, it would have been about $280,000."
p550
aS' Reasonable amount of money. But that was how much more was spent on saving the'
p551
aS'lives of the others. But given that these were mostly fairly young people, in terms of'
p552
aS'how much it would have cost to extend their lives for one year, it would be about'
p553
aS"$5,500. These people's lives were lost because we were not prepared $5,500 for each"
p554
aS'year of life that we could have saved. Compare that with the amount that those much'
p555
aS'criticized bodies Sally Pipes mentioned NICE, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence'
p556
aS'in the United Kingdom.'
p557
aS'What they say is too much to spend. Apparently, NICEs figure is around $49,000. In'
p558
aS'other words, almost 10 times, nine times as much as would have saved the lives of these'
p559
aS'young accident victims. And of course, we ration in a lot of other ways as well, because'
p560
aS"some people can't afford copayments. We have long waiting times. We don't pay"
p561
aS"doctors enough for Medicare, and so they don't take Medicare patients, or they don't"
p562
aS"take so many Medicare patients. So we are losing lives, and we're losing lives that we"
p563
aS'could save quite cheaply.'
p564
aS'So I think we ought to be more explicit about this. We ought to be prepared to say,'
p565
aS'"Let\'s use the dollars --" maybe we should spend more dollars. I\'m not necessarily'
p566
aS"opposed to spending more dollars. But let's use the dollars we spend in the most"
p567
aS'effective way in order to save the greatest number of lives.'
p568
aS'Something has to be done, because health care costs are rising here much faster than'
p569
aS"the economy is growing. They're rising at 9.8 percent per annum. We all know the"
p570
aS'economy is not growing at anything like that amount. So as that keeps happening,'
p571
aS"what's going to happen? It will eventually soak up all available spending. But we know"
p572
aS'the government has to spend on other things. On the website, in'
p573
aS"the articles that were posted. There's a very moving piece by Ken Connor about the"
p574
aS'plight of elderly citizens in our country, how they are neglected, and how because of the'
p575
aS"demographic changes, there's going to be more of them. Effectively, we need to spend"
p576
aS'a lot more to give our senior citizens a comfortable and dignified life when they can no'
p577
aS"longer look after themselves. That costs money, and it's going to cost more money."
p578
aS'We cannot increase health care spending indefinitely and also spend more on the'
p579
aS'elderly and spend more on the environment, on education, on all of the other important'
p580
aS'things that we need. So, like it nor not, we are rationing health care. We are arguing'
p581
aS"that, indeed, we should. That's obvious. But whether we should be more explicit about"
p582
aS'it, because we want to get the best results we can. We want to save the most number'
p583
aS'of lives that we can. And the way to do that is to be explicit and vote yes for this'
p584
aS'motion. We should be rationing health care. Thank you.'

S'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Sally Pipes\' mother\'s situation is exhibit "A" for'
p613
aS"why Americans don't want the government to wind up rationing health care in this"
p614
aS'country. By contrast, my mom suffered from advanced colon cancer late in life at an'
p615
aS"older age than Sally's mom. She received aggressive treatment, both surgery and"
p616
aS'chemotherapy, made a full recovery, and went on to live more than a decade of a good'
p617
aS'and healthy life, until she finally died at 90 at home in good health in her own bed.'
p618
aS"Which system would you prefer? Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to make three points, if"
p619
aS'I may, about why government should not be in the business of rationing health care.'
p620
aS'First of all, health care decisions should be made at the end of life, just as at any other'
p621
aS'point in life, at the bedside, by the people involved and who are affected, not by'
p622
aS'bureaucrats at a remote location.'
p623
aS'Secondly, that rationing is unethical, because it ultimately devalues human life and'
p624
aS'inevitably winds up punishing the sick and the dying.'
p625
aS"Thirdly rationing is the lazy man's way -- lazy man's attempt to balance the budget. It's"
p626
aS'easier to balance the budget on the backs of the sick and dying than it is to reform your'
p627
aS'ways of wasteful spending in government and try to wrench money back from the hands'
p628
aS'of the special interests at home and abroad. So back to the premises, first of all, that'
p629
aS"healthcare decisions should be made at the bedside. Americans don't want"
p630
aS'bureaucratic bean counters in Washington making decisions about what kind of care'
p631
aS"they're going to wind up receiving at the end of life. Decisions about healthcare and"
p632
aS'how it ought to be administered and when it ought to be administered ought to be'
p633
aS'decisions that are made by the patient informed by their doctors and by their families.'
p634
aS'Decisions about what kind of care will be administered at any given time to any given'
p635
aS'patient should take into account the needs of the patient. In other words, healthcare'
p636
aS'should be both individualized and particularized to the needs of the given patient. A'
p637
aS'bureaucrat remote from the bedside, hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away'
p638
aS'practicing assembly line medicine simply is not in a position to make those kinds of'
p639
aS'individualized decisions that are required. These are decisions that have to be based'
p640
aS'real time, sometimes at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning as Dr. Kellermann has pointed'
p641
aS"out. And it's the people who have their feet on their floor -- on the floor in the hospital"
p642
aS'and their hands on the patient who ought to be making these decisions.'
p643
aS"There's simply no way that a government functionary practicing assembly line medicine"
p644
aS'in Washington can make those kinds of decisions. Healthcare requires the fine edge of a'
p645
aS"scalpel, not the blunt end of an ax. And patients don't want their doctors straight-"
p646
aS'jacketed by some bureaucratic straightjacket fashioned in the federal city. They want'
p647
aS"decisions made by doctors who are taking their interests into account. They don't some"
p648
aS'interest that was decided in a smoke-filled room in Washington, in a room that was'
p649
aS'predominated by lobbyists to be the ones who are making the decisions.'
p650
aS'And, folks, do we really want the men who are wearing the green eye shades in'
p651
aS'Washington to be making these kinds of decisions? Should cost be the primary driver of'
p652
aS'such decision, especially in the zero sum environment that prevails in Washington?'
p653
aS'I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that when the tradeoffs are made, we'
p654
aS"don't want decisions about healthcare to go by the board in preference to a new start in"
p655
aS'green energy or some other pie in the sky kind of effort. Now, no one is suggesting for a'
p656
aS'moment that we should not be good stewards of scarce healthcare resources. We'
p657
aS"absolutely should be. But rationing is not what we need. It's rational care. We ought to"
p658
aS'be asking ourselves, is the procedure under consideration necessary for the patient? Is'
p659
aS'it clinically appropriate? Is the cost reasonable compared to similar services? These are'
p660
aS'questions that ought to be answered by people with their feet on the ground in the'
p661
aS'hospital in real time by hospitalization -- hospital utilization committees and not by'
p662
aS'people who are removed from the bedside.'
p663
aS'Now, folks, make no mistake about it, government rationing represents the first step'
p664
aS'down the road to the utilitarian philosophy of former Colorado governor Richard Lamb'
p665
aS'who said, "The elderly have a duty to die and get out of the way." This philosophy sees'
p666
aS'the elderly and the handicapped as resource hogs whose useful life is over and who now'
p667
aS'costs more to maintain than they produce. They reject the sanctity of life ethics that'
p668
aS'has long prevailed in this country, and that maintains that every human life is precious'
p669
aS'and out to be respected and protected under the law. That view affirms equal'
p670
aS'protection for all, the old, and the handicapped to the very young and to the very old.'
p671
aS' Instead the quality of life advocates maintain that we should use quality of life calculus'
p672
aS'and functional capacity studies in deciding who lives and who dies.'
p673
aS'Of course, the elderly and the handicapped who suffer from dementia and disability'
p674
aS"don't score well using those formulas. And isn't that the point? Ladies and gentlemen,"
p675
aS'what criteria will the all-wise bureaucrats use to pick winners and losers at the end of'
p676
aS'life?'
p677
aS'Will they be any more successful than they were in picking Solindra and Bright Source'
p678
aS'and Abound Solar on whom the government squandered billions of dollars? But then'
p679
aS"again, what does it matter? At the end of life, we're all going to die, right?"
p680
aS'Folks, I would suggest to you that there are many places that we can look to find the'
p681
aS'savings that we need to provide appropriate care for the sick and for the dying. For'
p682
aS"heaven's sakes, we spent $4 trillion on the Wall Street bailout to rescue businesses that"
p683
aS'engaged in profligate spending practices.'
p684
aS'Surely, we can spend the money required to render appropriate healthcare to the sick'
p685
aS'and the dying. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the proposition'
p686
aS"because by the time you reach the end of your life, you'll be glad you did. Thank you."
p687
aS'John Donvan'
p688
aS'Thank you, Ken Connor. That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S.'
p689
aS'debate.'
p690
aS'John Donvan'
p691
aS"Now we'll have the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions"
p692
aS'from me and from you in the audience, we have two teams of two. Arthur Kellermann'
p693
aS'and Peter Singer are arguing for the motion: "Ration end-of-life care." And we have'
p694
aS'heard them say basically that we already are rationing, that healthcare is rationed right'
p695
aS'now by the ability to pay for it by the individual and that it is time to be explicit, to'
p696
aS"ration in a different way, to step up and admit that's what we're doing and figure out a"
p697
aS'system for doing it.'
p698
aS'They say that you need to figure out how much saving a life produces in terms of'
p699
aS'results. You have to compare that to how the resources could be used elsewhere. The'
p700
aS'team arguing against the motion, Sally Pipes and Ken Connor, argue that rationing end-'
p701
aS'of-life care is the wrong way to balance the budget. They say that it would be falling to'
p702
aS'government bureaucrats to make intensely personal decisions, that cost should not be'
p703
aS'the driver of a decision regarding the end of life, and that they depict a future where'
p704
aS'basically the elderly will be thrown overboard. Now, I notice that the two sides do agree'
p705
aS'that cost cutting needs to happen, that costs are out of control. They do agree that'
p706
aS'ideally these decisions will be made at the bedside by doctors and their families. The'
p707
aS'question is, who ends up controlling where the money comes from. And I want to put'
p708
aS'to the side arguing in support of rationing end-of-life care, particularly to Peter Singer,'
p709
aS'this basic question: Is there a way actually to arrive at a dollar value for what a few'
p710
aS'more months of life would be worth to an elderly person versus what it would be worth'
p711
aS'to a younger person?'
p712
aS'And does that explain whether -- does that price carry over to whether a procedure is'
p713
aS'worth pursuing or not? Can you put a dollar number on these things?'

aS'should give people the best opportunity to get the best care that they can, regardless of'

p1493
aS'At the moment, people generally can say, "I don\'t want any more treatment." But if'
p1494
aS"there isn't treatment that's keeping them alive, they don't have that choice. Now the"
p1495
aS'citizens of Oregon, the citizens of Washington state, have voted in favor of having that'
p1496
aS'right, at least to get a physician to prescribe the medicine that they know will be lethal'
p1497
aS'that can end their life. The courts in Montana have said that citizens there have that'
p1498
aS'right as well. There are several nations in Europe that allow that and also allow -- some'
p1499
aS'of them allow a doctor to give a lethal injection as well on the request of the patient,'
p1500
aS'satisfying certain conditions like a second opinion. Those countries are satisfied with'
p1501
aS"that. In the Netherlands, for example, that's been the case for at least 20 years now."
p1502
aS' And through different governments, through liberal governments, through conservative'

aS'young people, for instance, to have health savings accounts with high deductible'

p2029
aS'last chance to try to ease your mind. On to round three, closing statements. They are'
p2030
aS'two minutes each. Our motion is this: Ration end-of-life care. And here to summarize'
p2031
aS'her position against this motion, Sally Pipes, president and chief executive officer of the'
p2032
aS'Pacific Research Institute.'
p2033
aS'Thank you, John. And you know by now I am against the proposition that end-of-life'
p2034
aS'care should be rationed. The Medicare trustees have projected that the program'
p2035
aS'Medicare will be bankrupt by 2024 at a cost of $1 trillion, almost double the costs today.'
p2036
aS' One of the ways to reduce the costs of our Medicare programs is to deny end-of-life'
p2037
aS"care. I believe it's morally wrong, but the position is supported by my opponent. There"
p2038
aS'are 50 million seniors in this country today on Medicare. And that number is going to'
p2039
aS'expand exponentially as the baby boomers retire. And I am one of the baby boomers.'
p2040
aS' Doctors are already feeling the financial squeeze. They are reimbursed by government'
p2041
aS'at a rate 20 percent below what they get for treating private patients. It is no wonder'
p2042
aS"that 52 percent of doctors surveyed say they're limiting the access of Medicare patients"
p2043
aS'to their practices. Unless reformed, this could result actually in bureaucrats setting an'
p2044
aS"age limit for one's life. In order to save Medicare for those who truly need it, changes"
p2045
aS'are necessary, including premium support, mean testing and raising the eligibility age'
p2046
aS'from 65.'
p2047
aS'Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi who represents my district, if the changes'
p2048
aS'suggested by Romney and Ryan are implemented, seniors will die in the streets. Well, I'
p2049
aS"believe if we don't make these changes, based on the Medicare cuts seniors will die in"
p2050
aS"the streets. They won't be able to get doctors or the care they need. Don Berwick when"
p2051
aS'he was administrator at CMMS said, "It\'s not a question of whether we\'re rationing care'
p2052
aS'or not. Will we ration it with our eyes open?" We do not want a NICE system in this'
p2053
aS"country. It's not the American way where a government body determines what is cost"
p2054
aS'effective rather than medically effective. America needs a healthcare system where'
p2055
aS'doctors and patients make decisions about the best kind of care that is needed when'
p2056
aS'their loved ones approach the end of their lives. Morally and ethically, this is the only'
p2057
aS'way to proceed. I urge you to vote against rationing the end-of-life care. Thank you'
p2058
aS'very much for listening.'

S"We've actually reached a surprising amount of agreement in this debate because both"
p2077
aS"sides agree that rationing occurs. Sally said there's always going to be rationing. Ken"
p2078
aS'said we are all in agreement that rationing occurs. The question is he went on to say, is'
p2079
aS'who should ration? He says he favors rationing through markets rather than'
p2080
aS'government. But you should read that article that he wrote that I mentioned before on'
p2081
aS'the website about the problems of the elderly because his approach from that article,'
p2082
aS'all-profits nursing homes have on average 32 percent fewer nurses and 47 percent'
p2083
aS'higher deficiencies than their nonprofit counterparts.'
p2084
aS'This increased emphasis on profits has led to a distressing rise in neglected end of use'
p2085

p2086
aS'problem of the allocation of medical resources, when he is broadly, I believe, critical of'
p2087
aS'what all-profits nursing homes do to abuse seniors. We think that there has to be a'

p2089
aS'Let me just conclude by referring to the case that Sally began with, the sad case of her'

aS'Australia or in the United Kingdom.'
p2093
aS'I or rather my wife, had two of our children in the United Kingdom and one of them in'
p2094
aS'Australia. I think that the quality of care that we have received in Australia has been'

aS"outstanding. I've obviously had medical care in this country. I don't think that it's better"

aS"than it is in Australia. And I don't think that it's even more a respectful of individual"

S'One of our founding fathers said, "If men were angels then we wouldnt need'

aS'government." Men are not angels and we do. Markets are not perfect. And they do'
p2116
aS'need regulation. The question is "Where do we wind up striking the balance?" And I'
p2117
aS"can tell you to Peters point that care in our nursing homes in America is America's dirty"
p2118
aS'secret.'
p2119
aS"And it's in part because a -- real estate investors pose as health care providers. And the"

aS'absolute scourge of preventable bedsores, and avoidable malnutrition, and dehydration,'
p2122
aS"falls, and avoidable infections. But let me say this, I think it's important to understand"
p2123
aS'that rationing is not required in order for the health care system to remain solvent. That'
p2124
aS"assumes the fallacy of only one alternative, that either we ration or we're going to go"

p2128
aS"It's hard work to wrest resources from the hands of the special interests. We should not"

p2130
aS'can provide good health care for all people through and including the end of life. We'
p2131
aS'need to ask good questions. We need to ask, "Are the procedures necessary? Are they'
