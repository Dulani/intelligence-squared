S'Nearly 18 years ago, the Oslo Accords were reached, which provided for mutual'
p33
aS'recognition of Israel and the PLO. Ever since there have been outbreaks of violence and'
p34
aS'an intermittent peace process has been carried on with the hope of resolving the'
p35
aS'conflicts. Very little tangible progress has been made, while Israeli settlements have'
p36
aS'altered the facts on the ground is Israels favor. On the other hand, the facts on the'
p37
aS'ground, in terms of world public opinion have moved decisively against Israel, not only'
p38
aS'in the Middle East, but in Europe, and perhaps in the U.S., as well.'
p39
aS'Against this back drop, the Palestinian authority is asking the UN for admission as a'
p40
aS'member state. A bit of background about the UN is helpful. The UN Security council'
p41
aS'includes five permanent members, the US, China, Russia, France, and the UK. Any one'
p42
aS'of these can veto the admission of Palestine. In contrast, the General Assembly, in'
p43
aS'which all members vote equally, can acknowledge Palestines status as a state, but only'
p44
aS'as a non member. Granting Palestine status as a member state would reinforce the'
p45
aS'UNs long standing resolutions in favor of a two state solution, express its disapproval of'
p46
aS'Israels settlements policy and the difficulties it has imposed on the lives of Palestinians'
p47
aS'living in the west bank. It would lend moral authority to the Palestinian cause, and'
p48
aS'might induce Israel to take a more conciliatory posture in negotiations.'
p49
aS'The US could exercise its veto power in the Security Council but at a cost in terms of our'
p50
aS'relations with the Arab world. And even a vote by the General Assembly to grant'
p51
aS'Palestine status as a non member state might give the Palestinians access to the'
p52
aS'International Criminal Court, where they could legally challenge the Israel occupation.'
p53
aS'On the other hand, nothing the UN can do will alter the facts on the ground. Nothing'
p54
aS'will resolve the dysfunctional, fragmented, conflict ridden, often corrupt, character of'
p55
aS'Palestinian attempts at self- government. Nothing will get the Palestinians to develop a'
p56
aS'coherent negotiating position, or to provide realistic assurances that agreements once'
p57
aS'reached would be enforced. Prior UN resolutions have endorsed the goal of Palestinian'
p58
aS'sovereignty.'
p59
aS'A UN admission of Palestine would be a redundant expression of hope, rather than a'
p60
aS'meaningful step toward peace. Debates about Israel and the Middle East are always'
p61
aS'heated. Tonights debate should generate light as well. We have an outstanding group'
p62
aS'of experts to illuminate these vexing issues, and its my pleasure to turn the evening'
p63
aS'over to our moderator, John Donvan.'

S'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on October 10, 1971, the United Nations admitted'
p218
aS"the People's Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan. If that were the"
p219
aS'kind of motion we were debating tonight, I would not be standing here arguing in favor.'
p220
aS'What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but'
p221
aS'alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century. Let me'
p222
aS'first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate'
p223
aS'tonight. We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, "Does'
p224
aS'Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood?" Law matters, but this is'
p225
aS"primarily a political, not a legal question. And it's not about the United Nations and"
p226
aS'whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution. It can be both, and Israel of'
p227
aS'course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed. But the assumption of'
p228
aS'this debate is the two-state paradigm. We do not have anyone here advocating a'
p229
aS'greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris'
p230
aS'to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities.'
p231
aS'The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious.'
p232
aS'Approximately 600,000 Israelis, one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line.'
p233
aS"Settlements grow. Outposts are legalized. I invite you to go and see the reality. And it's"
p234
aS'not just a physical manifestation of blurring. It is also the conceptual universe in which a'
p235
aS'growing number of Israelis live. Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on'
p236
aS'two states, but he has not walked the walk. His own Likud party platform opposes two'
p237
aS'states, and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago'
p238
aS"we had nothing, then we got Balfour, then we got the '47 partition, then we got 78"
p239
aS"percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we're not going"
p240
aS'anywhere.'
p241
aS"That's a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in"
p242
aS"New Hampshire tonight's part of that amen corner. Passivity cannot be the response. If"
p243
aS'we want two states, we have to act. And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the'
p244
aS'anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment. We need to be deeply respectful of'
p245
aS'the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the'
p246
aS'conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of'
p247
aS'clarity is for that Israeli conversation. Indulging bad behavior, treating that with'
p248
aS'impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament.'
p249
aS'And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we'
p250
aS'pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow'
p251
aS"we're making it easier for Israeli society to change course. We are not. The cost benefit"
p252
aS'calculation of Israelis needs to look different. Do we really think that Israel is waiting to'
p253
aS"leave the territory, it's just waiting, and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough"
p254
aS"and behave well enough, and that's the key to unlock this? Let's acknowledge that it's"
p255
aS"not going to be easy but the current policies aren't helping. What, then, can be done?"
p256
aS"The Palestinians do actually have options, violence. I'm against that. That's illegitimate."
p257
aS'They can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning. I can see its legitimacy,'
p258
aS"but I'm not an advocate of that. Or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay"
p259
aS'down a marker to get the attention of Israelis.'
p260
aS"That's what U.N. membership is, and I would argue it correlates with what is best,"
p261
aS"therefore, for Israel. We can't expect the Palestinians to wait forever, and we can't say"
p262
aS'to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor'
p263
aS'can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state. Suggesting'
p264
aS"the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it's also immoral. So if we want to"
p265
aS"salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can't impose a solution and if we"
p266
aS"can't even prevent deterioration, if we can't even get a settlement freeze, then how do"
p267
aS'we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea? We vote to admit Palestine to'
p268
aS'the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight. U.N. membership is not a silver bullet. Its'
p269
aS'not a panacea. Its not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East.'
p270
aS'But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future. We'
p271
aS'will no doubt be told that this cant happen, that its meaningless symbolism, and'
p272
aS'especially not now with the Arab spring. Wrong. Yes, the U.S. has committed to a veto.'
p273
aS'No doubt, well discuss that. But does that make this debate pointless? Can the'
p274
aS'realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation? If thats the case, I'
p275
aS'strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning'
p276
aS'college football, because it wont be. And that can always be an argument. I urge the'
p277
aS'other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than'
p278
aS'negotiations. Those negotiations are asymmetrical. One side is so lacking in leverage'
p279
aS'and they are so steeped in years of failure. Negotiations cannot be the singular tool in'
p280
aS'our toolkit.'
p281
aS'And finally, if we are concerned about Israels security, then lets acknowledge that hope'
p282
aS'too is a security currently. Hopelessness encourages violence. There will always be the'
p283
aS'next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of'
p284
aS'interests and balances and avoiding casus belli. And perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself'
p285
aS'contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy. Eventually managing an occupation and'
p286
aS'justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist. Not to dramatize, but if'
p287
aS'we dont have a Palestine, we are saying Kaddish. We are saying the right of prayer, of'
p288
aS'last prayer for Israeli democracy. I urge you to support this motion, to support the'
p289
aS'principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N. Thank you.'

aS'Israeli-Palestinian peace, of logic and common sense. All of this, however, does not'

p321
aS'conundrum. We are stuck. Violence will never produce sovereignty for Palestinians, but'
p322
aS'neither will negotiations right now. So the question is what to do. What you are'
p323
aS'suggesting, in my judgment, is that we take an action that is not simply neutral, that will'
p324
aS'retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is.'

p326
aS'proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will'
p327
aS'not bring Palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty. I speak here not as an Israeli to'
p328
aS'you and not as a Palestinian. I speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an'
p329
aS'American, absorbed in this process for many years, 25 years. And during the course of'
p330
aS'that period, I developed a faith in three primary assumptions: Number one, there was a'
p331
aS'solution, equitable and durable; number two, negotiations were the only way to achieve'
p332
aS'it. And negotiations is flawed and its imperfect because its based on human frailty and'
p333
aS'weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise; and finally, that the United'
p334
aS'States had a critical role to play in this process by being fair, by being tough and by being'
p335
aS'reassuring -- all of these assumptions.'
p336
aS'Any honest man or woman would acknowledge . And the situation,'
p337
aS'youre quite correct, Dan, it will be worse. It will get worse before it gets worse. But the'
p338
aS'question still has to be addressed. How will granting the putative state of Palestine'
p339
aS'admission as a full-member state into the U.N. address any of this? Now, Im here to'
p340
aS'argue in six basic points. I dont want to bore you. Im not here to entertain you, but to'
p341
aS'leave you with perhaps a bakers dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why I'
p342
aS'believe this is a bad idea. And, by the way, I concede, particularly to you, Daniel, that I'
p343
aS'know bad ideas when I see them.'
p344
aS'I know illusions when I see them. I was responsible, over the course of a 20-year period,'
p345
aS'for quite a few, as Mustafa will attest, perhaps even Dore. But not tonight. I have no'
p346
aS'illusions tonight. First, as an American whose country sits on the Security Council, I'
p347
aS'cannot, in all good conscience, recommend the admission of a putative state however'

aS"has done. It'll undermine the institutions. Palestine has no borders. It has no control"
p352
aS'over its population. It has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own'
p353
aS'society. In short, it does not control the guns, all of the guns in its society. I would'
p354
aS"argue that's critically important for statehood."
p355
aS"Yes, much of this may be due to the Israeli occupation. But that doesn't change the"
p356
aS'reality. Admission of Palestine now will create a situation in which it cannot discharge its'
p357
aS'own obligations as a member state, in large part because half of its government, the'
p358
aS"rival Palestinian national movement doesn't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate"
p359
aS'conflicts. Mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of UN'
p360
aS"membership. Second, as an American, I'd oppose this because I believe it's not symbolic."
p361
aS"It's not symbolic at all. It's a prescription, and an RX, if you will, for instability and"
p362
aS'perhaps even escalation. Think about it. We are admitting the Palestinian authority'
p363
aS'that presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities, one, the'
p364
aS'state of Israel, an ally of the United States, and the second factor and force, Hamas, an'
p365
aS'entity which is an adversary of the United States, has more control over what transpires'
p366
aS'in Palestine, this putative state than the Palestinian authority.'
p367
aS'That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence. Mustafa'
p368
aS'will tell you, and he may be right, that the basis for this negotiation, and the basis of --'
p369
aS"for any Palestinian state will be June 4, '67 borders. But admitting Palestine into the UN"
p370
aS'will mean that a Palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to'
p371
aS"defend those borders. I wouldn't want -- I mean, maybe you see this as a blessing. I see"
p372
aS'it as a huge contradiction, to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has'
p373
aS'to defend borders that he cannot defend. And what is he to say to his public when the'
p374
aS'Israelis continue to do what they will do?'
p375
aS'Which brings me to my third point. There will be an Israeli reaction. And who is going'
p376
aS'to control that reaction? The United States? The international community? As Israel'
p377
aS'seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries, to basically say to the Palestinians, fine, you'
p378
aS"have now set your boundaries. June 4, '67, is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return"
p379
aS"to the table. But we're going to set ours now as well. We will set our boundaries. And"
p380
aS'we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of'
p381
aS"solution. For, if the Palestinians want to pick a fight with the Americans, that's their"
p382
aS"business. But I would argue it's counterproductive. You're going to have an election in"
p383
aS"November. And I'm not talking as a Republican or as a Democrat. But anybody looking"
p384
aS'at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting'
p385
aS'Palestinian statehood, you probably would want to see the re-election of the current'
p386
aS'president.'
p387
aS'You would probably want to see the re-election of the current president, which would'
p388
aS"mean essentially that you're not going to force him into a position to take action that"
p389
aS"will weaken the prospects of his own election. Finally, I'll come back to my initial point."
p390
aS"Just because we're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that's going to take us"
p391
aS'farther away than ever from our goal. Admission of Palestine now without an'
p392
aS'agreement will take Palestinians farther away from sovereignty.'

(lp426
S'Thank you so much. And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to'
p427
aS'this debate. I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be'
p428
aS'admitted to the UN. The first is that time is not an infinite commodity. And time --'
p429
aS"we're losing time. And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground,"
p430
aS'which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of'
p431
aS'losing the two-state solution.'
p432
aS'If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution. And'
p433
aS'the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody. So we need the UN in this case'
p434
aS'to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is'
p435
aS'defending. What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to'
p436
aS"continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce"
p437
aS'anything because of the imbalance. What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible'
p438
aS'towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well. What they are'
p439
aS'proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same'
p440
aS'thing over and over again and expect different results.'
p441
aS'Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN'
p442
aS'admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a'
p443
aS'Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free.'
p444
aS'Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides'
p445
aS'negotiating over a piece of cheese. One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars.'
p446
aS'The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating. At'
p447
aS"the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about. And that is not a solution. So"
p448
aS'my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the'
p449
aS'United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the'
p450
aS'weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness'
p451
aS'of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy.'
p452
aS'We have one of three options. Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and'
p453
aS"that's what some people are calling for. In this case, what you will witness is the"
p454
aS'consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against.'
p455
aS'And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something'
p456
aS'that nobody could be proud about. Or the second option is violence, which we reject,'
p457
aS"and we don't want. The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly"
p458
aS'like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States. And'
p459
aS"that's the course we are taking."
p460
aS"And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance"
p461
aS'within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change'
p462
aS'the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a'
p463
aS'result at the end of the road. My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted'
p464
aS'to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to'
p465
aS"human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the"
p466
aS'message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign. If we speak about the right of'
p467
aS'people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have'
p468
aS'self-determination, then why not Palestine? And why continue to use the double'
p469
aS'standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a'
p470
aS'historical mistake that was made. Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about'
p471
aS'two states, Israel was established.'
p472
aS'Palestine was not. My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United'
p473
aS'Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground. We understand, but it'
p474
aS'will achieve three goals. First, it will give us hope. It will give Palestinians hope. Hope is'
p475
aS'what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle.'
p476
aS'Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence'
p477
aS'and dangerous things. Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de'
p478
aS'facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements. And,'
p479
aS'third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless'
p480
aS'Palestinians are also free.'
p481
aS'We are now victims of oppression and discrimination. The Israelis are hostage to'
p482
aS'occupation and fear, especially security fear. And Mr. Gold will try to show you that'
p483
aS'there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring. Instead of Israel being happy'
p484
aS'about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear. This is not the right'
p485
aS'approach. We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance'
p486
aS'through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as'
p487
aS'well. Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans,'
p488
aS'from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and'
p489
aS'the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid.'
p490
aS"And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from"
p491
aS'oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system,'
p492
aS'and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia. One time a Palestinian'
p493
aS'leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch. Today we are'
p494
aS"coming to the United Nations with two olive branches. Don't let us drop them. Thank"
p495
aS'you.'

p524
aS"Palestinian membership at the U.N., we're not in New Hampshire. When I served as"
p525
aS"Israel's ambassador to the United Nations back in the late 1990s, I had a colleague, a"
p526
aS'counterpart, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, became a very close'
p527
aS"friend, it's someone I intellectually admired. His name, unfortunately he's passed away,"
p528
aS'was Richard Holbrooke. And one of the things I was struck by, before I was sent to the'
p529
aS'U.N. I was the Israeli negotiator. I was sent to the sand dunes of Gaza where'
p530
aS'Muhammad picked me up in that extended Mercedes and take me to'
p531
aS"Arafat's house. We would discuss how to move forward in peace, and, by the way,"
p532
aS"those discussions were tough because he -- when you're in a meeting like that, you"
p533
aS"don't know where to park your head."
p534
aS'Should you remember the Israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that'
p535
aS"came out of territory under Arafat's jurisdiction? I know that's tough to mention, but"
p536
aS"you've got to know that. Do you think of those people? Do you think about the"
p537
aS'moment? Do you think about building a future? Do you forget about the tragedies of'
p538
aS"the past so you'll have hope? How do you orient yourself? It's very, very tough. But I"
p539
aS'had that experience. We were involved in -- I spent hours with Mahmoud Abbas, Abu'
p540
aS'Mazen. I spent a tremendous time on the Hebron Agreement with Aaron and of course'
p541
aS"the Wye Agreement that followed afterwards. And what I had seen in the '90s is that"
p542
aS"we didn't succeed. We didn't succeed. We reached agreements. And, by the way, the"
p543
aS'man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner Prime Minister Benjamin'
p544
aS'Netanyahu signed two agreements with the Palestinians -- withdrew from territory,'
p545
aS'made sacrifices for peace, risked his whole political base because he wanted to move'
p546
aS'the process forward.'
p547
aS'It may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles, but I experienced that. But let'
p548
aS'me go back to Holbrooke. So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward. And after'
p549
aS'I left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office. And Barak went'
p550
aS'to Camp David with Yasser Arafat. The peace wasnt concluded. But I asked myself'
p551
aS'through my contacts with Holbrooke, How was it? And Richard Holbrooke delivered'
p552
aS'the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration, the Dayton'
p553
aS'Accords over Bosnia. Well, we didnt succeed in the Middle East. We failed at Camp'
p554
aS'David. Im not sure I still understand why that occurred.'
p555
aS'By the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between Croats, Bosnian Muslims, the'
p556
aS'Serbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial. It had all the ingredients that we had. But they'
p557
aS'persisted. They persisted to negotiate. I discerned from my discussions with Holbrooke'
p558
aS'and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements. He'
p559
aS'concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome. As much as you could be cynical'
p560
aS'about tough negotiations, thats the only outcome that will work. The second thing that'
p561
aS'comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that'
p562
aS'peacemaking must come from the parties themselves. The great breakthroughs of'
p563
aS'Dayton came from those three warring parties. Its true. They were brought to Ohio.'
p564
aS'Its true. Secretary of State was in and out. President Clinton was ready to come in.'
p565
aS'But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace. And'
p566
aS'finally, you need diplomatic flexibility. Let me tell you something. Both sides, certainly'
p567
aS'in our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of'
p568
aS'our cause. But tonights not the night to lay that out to you. The point is that even'
p569
aS'though you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go on'
p570
aS'every American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the American'
p571
aS'audience, you have got to make a compromise. Youve got to cut a deal. You cant walk'
p572
aS'away. And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because they'
p573
aS'knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility,'
p574
aS'in the Balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal.'
p575
aS'In fact, Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: Will the Bosnians grasp an'
p576
aS'imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton was'
p577
aS'convened? Now, let me move to the issue at hand between us. What is my problem'
p578
aS'with the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state? As I'
p579
aS'said in my opening words, this isnt about national dignity. You know, every people'
p580
aS'wants to recognized. And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of'
p581
aS'whos supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every national'
p582
aS'movement wants to be recognized to the U.N. So my question isnt about recognizing'
p583
aS'the rights of Palestinians.'
p584
aS'That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978.'
p585
aS'My question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold. First of all, carefully listening'
p586
aS'to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at the'
p587
aS'U.N. General Assembly, he wasnt just saying, Accept us in principle. He was laying'
p588
aS'out borders. And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, as'
p589
aS'though there was some kind of pre-67 boundary, border, that was an international line'
p590
aS'that we have to agree to. Thats it. When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borders'
p591
aS'were supposed to be negotiated. And that -- to that point, to that very point, Yasser'
p592
aS'Arafat agreed. He signed those agreements.'
p593
aS'Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement. The implement agreements, he later'
p594
aS"signed. So we're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the"
p595
aS'UN.'

p624

aS'that the Israelis cannot ignore. The team arguing against the motion, they include Dore'

aS'Gold and Aaron David Miller, are arguing against this motion on the grounds, number'
p627
aS"one, that what exists now in the territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority doesn't"

aS"really meet the qualifications of a state because it can't control its borders, it can't"
p629
aS"control its guns. And they're also arguing that it is too soon to give up on negotiation"

aS"itself. So we're going to take questions from you. But first from me, I want to put a"
p631
aS'question to the side arguing against the motion. And I think, Dore, this may have been'

aS'therefore, Prime Minister Sharon, whom I knew very well, decided to take that risk and'
