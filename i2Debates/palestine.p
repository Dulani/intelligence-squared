p371
aS'What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century.'
p372
aS'Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight.'
p373
aS'We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, "Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood?'
p374
aS'" Law matters, but this is primarily a political, not a legal question.'
p375
aS"And it's not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution."
p376
aS'It can be both, and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed.'
p377
aS'But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm.'

aS'I invite you to go and see the reality.'

p388

p389
aS'Passivity cannot be the response.'
p390
aS'If we want two states, we have to act.'
p391
aS'And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment.'
p392
aS'We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation.'
p393
aS'Indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament.'
p394
aS"And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we're making it easier for Israeli society to change course."

aS'The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different.'

p504
aS'Mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of UNmembership.'
p505
aS"Second, as an American, I'd oppose this because I believe it's not symbolic.It's not symbolic at all."
p506
aS"It's a prescription, and an RX, if you will, for instability andperhaps even escalation."
p507
aS'Think about it.'
p508
aS'We are admitting the Palestinian authoritythat presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities, one, thestate of Israel, an ally of the United States, and the second factor and force, Hamas, anentity which is an adversary of the United States, has more control over what transpiresin Palestine, this putative state than the Palestinian authority.That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence.'

(lp643
S'Thank you so much.'
p644
aS'And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate.'
p645
aS'I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN.'
p646
aS'The first is that time is not an infinite commodity.'
p647
aS"And time -- we're losing time."
p648
aS'And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground, which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution.'
p649
aS'If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution.'
p650
aS'And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody.'
p651
aS'So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending.'
p652
aS"What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance."
p653
aS'What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well.'
p654
aS'What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results.'
p655
aS'Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free.'
p656
aS'Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese.'
p657
aS'One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars.'
p658
aS'The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating.'
p659
aS"At the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about."
p660
aS'And that is not a solution.'
p661
aS'So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy.'
p662
aS'We have one of three options.'
p663
aS"Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for."
p664
aS'In this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against.'
p665
aS'And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about.'
p666
aS"Or the second option is violence, which we reject, and we don't want."
p667
aS'The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States.'
p668
aS"And that's the course we are taking."
p669
aS"And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road."
p670
aS"My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign."
p671
aS'If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not Palestine?'
p672
aS'And why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made.'
p673
aS'Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states, Israel was established.'
p674
aS'Palestine was not.'
p675
aS'My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground.'
p676
aS'We understand, but it will achieve three goals.'
p677
aS'First, it will give us hope.'
p678
aS'It will give Palestinians hope.'
p679
aS'Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle.'
p680
aS'Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things.'
p681
aS'Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements.'
p682
aS'And, third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free.'
p683
aS'We are now victims of oppression and discrimination.'
p684
aS'The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear.'
p685
aS'And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring.'
p686
aS'Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear.'
p687
aS'This is not the right approach.'
p688
aS'We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well.'
p689
aS'Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans, from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid.'
p690
aS"And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system, and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia."
p691
aS'One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch.'
p692
aS'Today we are coming to the United Nations with two olive branches.'

aS"We didn't succeed."

p792
aS'But letme go back to Holbrooke.'
p793
aS'So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward.'
p794
aS'And afterI left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office.'
p795
aS'And Barak wentto Camp David with Yasser Arafat.'
p796
aS'The peace wasnt concluded.'
p797
aS'But I asked myselfthrough my contacts with Holbrooke, How was it?'
p798
aS'And Richard Holbrooke deliveredthe greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration, the DaytonAccords over Bosnia.'
p799
aS'Well, we didnt succeed in the Middle East.'
p800
aS'We failed at CampDavid.'
p801
aS'Im not sure I still understand why that occurred.By the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between Croats, Bosnian Muslims, theSerbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial.'
p802
aS'It had all the ingredients that we had.'
p803
aS'But theypersisted.'
p804
aS'They persisted to negotiate.'
p805
aS'I discerned from my discussions with Holbrookeand from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements.'
p806
aS'Heconcluded that there must be a negotiated outcome.'
p807
aS'As much as you could be cynicalabout tough negotiations, thats the only outcome that will work.'
p808
aS'The second thing thatcomes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is thatpeacemaking must come from the parties themselves.'

aS'They were brought to Ohio.Its true.'
p812
aS'Secretary of State was in and out.'
p813
aS'President Clinton was ready to come in.But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace.'
p814
aS'Andfinally, you need diplomatic flexibility.'
p815
aS'Let me tell you something.'
p816
aS'Both sides, certainlyin our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice ofour cause.'
p817
aS'But tonights not the night to lay that out to you.'
p818
aS'The point is that eventhough you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go onevery American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the Americanaudience, you have got to make a compromise.'
p819
aS'Youve got to cut a deal.'
p820
aS'You cant walkaway.'
p821
aS'And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because theyknew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility,in the Balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal.In fact, Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: Will the Bosnians grasp animperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton wasconvened?'
p822
aS'Now, let me move to the issue at hand between us.'
p823
aS'What is my problemwith the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state?'
p824
aS'As Isaid in my opening words, this isnt about national dignity.'
p825
aS'You know, every peoplewants to recognized.'
p826
aS'And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion ofwhos supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every nationalmovement wants to be recognized to the U.N.'
p827
aS'So my question isnt about recognizingthe rights of Palestinians.That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978.My question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold.'
p828
aS'First of all, carefully listeningto the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at theU.N.'
p829
aS'General Assembly, he wasnt just saying, Accept us in principle.'
p830
aS'He was layingout borders.'
p831
aS'And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, asthough there was some kind of pre-67 boundary, border, that was an international linethat we have to agree to.'
p832
aS'Thats it.'
p833
aS'When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borderswere supposed to be negotiated.'
p834
aS'And that -- to that point, to that very point, YasserArafat agreed.'
p835

p902
aS'As I said in my opening words, this isnt about national dignity.'
p903
aS'You know, every people wants to recognized.'
p904
aS'And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of whos supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every national movement wants to be recognized to the U.N.'
p905
aS'So my question isnt about recognizing the rights of Palestinians.'
p906
aS'That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978.'
p907

p908
aS'First of all, carefully listening to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at the U.N. General Assembly, he wasnt just saying, Accept us in principle.'
p909
aS'He was laying out borders.'
p910
aS'And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, as though there was some kind of pre-67 boundary, border, that was an international line that we have to agree to.'
p911
aS'Thats it.'
p912
aS'When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borders were supposed to be negotiated.'
p913
aS'And that -- to that point, to that very point, Yasser Arafat agreed.'
p914
aS'He signed those agreements.'
p915
aS'Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement.'
p916
aS'The implement agreements, he later signed.'

p3941
aS'In the meantime, very briefly, I want to tell you about our next debate.'
p3942
aS"It's coming up on February 7th."
p3943
aS"And in light of the fact that there is a health crisis in this country of many, many varieties, but we're going to be talking about the obesity epidemic, with 33 percent of adults in this country, and 17 percent of children obese, we thought it was time to find a way to look at this issue as a matter of debate."
p3944
aS"And the way that we're looking at it is whether -- where is the issue of personal responsibility and government responsibility in this in terms of, are people obese simply because they eat too much, or are they obese because they're being advertised to because of what's in food, and additives, the proliferation of fast food."
p3945
aS'And does government have a role in that or not.'
p3946
aS'Basically, whose fault is it?'
p3947
aS'And who should do something about it?'
p3948
aS'Arguing in support of the following motion: "Obesity is the government\'s business will be Pamela Peeke, also a medical doctor.'

aS"She's a nationally renowned physician, a scientist and an expert in the fields of nutrition and fitness."
p3950
aS'And on web MD, she is the chief lifestyle expert.'
p3951
aS"The team arguing against this, that's saying obesity is not the government's business, is Paul Campos."

aS'He is author of "The Obesity Myth.'
p3953
aS'" He\'s a Constitutional law professor who came to this issue in an unusual way.'
p3954
aS"He was watching all of the coverage of the Monica Lewinsky story back in the late '90s, and he became obsessed with the obsession in the news media over Monica Lewinsky's weight."
p3955
aS'And he just started thinking.'
p3956
aS'And he ended up writing some books and has strong points of view on this issue.'
p3957
aS"And his debating partner, also arguing that it is not the government's business, but a matter of personal responsibility, John Stossel, an Emmy award-winning journalist."
p3958
aS"He is host of FOX Business Network's Stossel, a weekly program that highlights consumer issues."
p3959
aS'He is a contrarian.'
p3960
aS"If you know him, who would like government to stop meddling in people's business."
p3961
aS'And he is himself a very, very slender television correspondent.'
p3962
aS'And I can -- I can only admire him.'
p3963
aS"So we'll take just about 30 seconds more."
p3964
aS'And the results will come to us.'
p3965
aS'But thank you very much for your patience.'

aS'Okay.'

aS'" We asked you to vote before and again afterwards.'
p3972
aS'The vote afterwards telling us which side you feel presented the better argument.'
p3973
aS'Before the debate, 37 percent were in support of the motion that the U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state, 30 percent were against, and 33 percent were undecided.'
p3974
aS'After the debate, 55 percent support this motion, that is up 18 percent, 37 percent are against, that is up only seven percent, the undecideds went down by 25 percent to eight percent.'
