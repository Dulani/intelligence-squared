S'Thank you. I want to begin by repeating a point that Bob Rosenkranz made. This is not'
p285
aS"a debate about policy. As it happens, I can't completely speak for my colleague,"
p286
aS'Professor Dershowitz, but I would very much oppose, for example, a federal law'
p287
aS'banning guns independent of the Second Amendment, because it is very, very clear that'
p288
aS'there is a critical mass of Americans who would be vehemently opposed to that. It'
p289
aS'would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of'
p290
aS'criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like,'
p291
aS'there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced. Most'
p292
aS'enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively'
p293
aS'legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity.'
p294
aS"It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed"
p295
aS'that I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds,'
p296
aS"but fortunately we're not here to debate that. Nor do I think we are here to debate the"
p297
aS'one true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about'
p298
aS'which indeed I have written. Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us,'
p299
aS'The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness. Now, one reason I'
p300
aS"relish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I will"
p301
aS'admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because I'
p302
aS'believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness.'
p303
aS"I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the one"
p304
aS"that has most outlived its usefulness, but I'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013"
p305
aS'the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in the'
p306
aS'Bill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived their'
p307
aS'usefulness. So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantive'
p308
aS'rights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff'
p309
aS'like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like? Would it include a'
p310
aS'substantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms?'
p311
aS'And I would argue that the answer is no. Let me also emphasize that this is a different'
p312
aS'question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms. Eugene'
p313
aS"has written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current number"
p314
aS"is, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that"
p315
aS'raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the United'
p316
aS'States constitution as well. Let me give you two principle reasons why a'
p317
aS'constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply'
p318
aS'be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today'
p319
aS"is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that"
p320
aS'we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners.'
p321
aS'So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived its'
p322
aS'usefulness in the 21st century. The first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal. That is'
p323
aS'to say, one of the anomalies -- sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a'
p324
aS'scorecard -- in the debate about gun rights. There are many people who define'
p325
aS'themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that'
p326
aS'believes in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems. Well, this is not necessarily'
p327
aS'what Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in the'
p328
aS'McDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line.'
p329
aS'Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation.'
p330
aS'Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. There are some states --'
p331
aS'or cities -- very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer different'
p332
aS'experiments. Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great'
p333
aS'cities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far,'
p334
aS'far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say. And one of the things that a single'
p335
aS'national constitutional amendment -- as interpreted by the Supreme Court -- does is to'
p336
aS"stifle that kind of federalism. And I think that's a mistake."
p337
aS"But there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the"
p338
aS'21st century. As Mr. Rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms -- or the Second'
p339
aS"Amendment -- had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008. It's not that people didn't write"
p340
aS'about it. I wrote about it. Eugene wrote about it. A number of people found it very'
p341
aS'interesting. But it played remarkably little role in actual American law. Beginning with'
p342
aS'Heller, it does play a role. But what does that mean? It means that you turn over'
p343
aS'decision-making power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have'
p344
aS'no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable -- even unreasoned --'
p345
aS'distinctions.'
p346
aS'Thus, for example, in Heller, Justice Scalia says that Dick Heller is protected, which I'
p347
aS'think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that Martha Stewart is not,'
p348
aS"because she actually lied to an FBI agent and is thus a convicted felon. I don't think"
p349
aS'judges should be making those kinds of decisions. I think legislators should.'

S"All right. Thank you very much for having me here. And it's such a great pleasure to be"
p378
aS"on the same panel with David, and Alan, and Sandy. They're all top scholars and I also"
p379
aS'reckon all of them as friends of mine.'
p380
aS'And so let me start with something I think we all agree on, on the panel. And I think'
p381
aS'probably virtually everybody -- perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, and'
p382
aS"that is that there's a basic human right to self-defense. And there are, of course,"
p383
aS"debates about the particular boundaries of that right. But there's a core to that right"
p384
aS"that every state in the union recognizes. I'm sure it's well-recognized outside the U.S. as"
p385
aS'well. If somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape,'
p386
aS"kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself if"
p387
aS"that is necessary. That is very broadly agreed on. And I think it's agreed on because it is"
p388
aS"a basic human right. So I think there's little difference about that. But then there's the"
p389
aS'question -- what does that right entail? And I want to argue that a right to self-defense,'
p390
aS'like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that are'
p391
aS'necessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself.'
p392
aS"Let's take an example. The right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether you"
p393
aS"want to have children or not. Imagine somebody says oh sure, I'm all for that right, you"
p394
aS"can use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method. We wouldn't say that's a"
p395
aS"serious argument. We'd say it's a parody of an argument, right? We'd say well of"
p396
aS'course, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools that'
p397
aS"are reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that. That's not just for that right, it's"
p398
aS"also for speech. Your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it's"
p399
aS'the right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonably'
p400
aS'necessary to effectively defend yourself. And guns are reasonably are necessary to'
p401
aS'effectively defend yourself. Our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defend'
p402
aS'ourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, and'
p403
aS'even if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficiently'
p404
aS'ruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with a'
p405
aS'gun, often not by shooting it. The overwhelming majority of all defensive gun users'
p406
aS'involve just threatening to use it.'
p407
aS"Just a couple of thought experiments. I'm sure some of you live in places -- in houses"
p408
aS'where on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol. I suspect few of you live in'
p409
aS'houses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol. I would be willing'
p410
aS'to bet that. So in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armed'
p411
aS'guards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled to'
p412
aS'essentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves. The right to bear'
p413
aS"arms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone. If"
p414
aS"they are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allows"
p415
aS"people to do. And I think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutions"
p416
aS"specifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's an"
p417
aS"individual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism. This dates"
p418
aS'back from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012,'
p419
aS'and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well.'
p420
aS"Now, some people may say well okay, fine. It's reasonable to say there's a presumption"
p421
aS'in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be'
p422
aS"rebuttable. If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns"
p423
aS'would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there may'
p424
aS'be, well, then we should do that. Well, interesting argument, but there is no such'
p425
aS'evidence. So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee of'
p426
aS'scholars, of criminologists. They put out this very nice report. You can read it for free'
p427
aS"online. The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either"
p428
aS'extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer.'
p429
aS'Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result. The other studies as'
p430
aS"well from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun control"
p431
aS'work. His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what'
p432
aS'we know. Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions,'
p433
aS'but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges? Well, one'
p434
aS'reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level,'
p435
aS'questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety'
p436
aS'of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process. We have set them up'
p437
aS'as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this'
p438
aS'question as to whether this makes sense. Well, I think the answer to that you have to'
p439
aS'think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country'
p440
aS'given the political realities. And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want?'
p441
aS"If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want?"
p442
aS'Now, if what you want -- so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might'
p443
aS'want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size'
p444
aS'of large capacity magazines. You have to decide what is it that you want. Now, if you'
p445
aS'want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you'
p446
aS"with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the Second"
p447
aS'Amendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived its'
p448
aS"usefulness. There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade. There are 300"
p449
aS"million guns in the country. They're not just going away. Criminals will have access to"
p450
aS'them, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will become'
p451
aS"criminals because they will insist on retaining them. Aha, people say well, but that's not"
p452
aS"what we want, right? We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear."
p453
aS'Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun'
p454
aS"controls the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way. Courts"
p455
aS"have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges. There's a wide range of"
p456
aS"modest gun controls. To be sure, there's federal level in many states,"
p457
aS"though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal"
p458
aS'constraint.'
p459
aS'The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control -- some'
p460
aS"people think it should be. But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't"
p461
aS"likely to be. But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendment"
p462
aS'is your friend. And any attempt to repeal it -- that is what your enemy would be.'
p463
aS'Because all of those people who have been assured, "Oh, I\'m not going to take away'
p464
aS"your guns. Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you're just"
p465
aS'paranoid" -- if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I think'
p466
aS"is the implication of the conclusion that it's outlived its usefulness would be, that would"
p467
aS"turn that all -- make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that's"
p468
aS"what's going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns. So if you want"
p469
aS"modest gun controls -- I'm not saying you should -- but if you do, you should be arguing"
p470
aS'that the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness. Part of its usefulness --'
p471
aS'besides self-defense -- is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not'
p472
aS'coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president --'

S'Thank you. What a great and powerful argument. No wonder he is considered a genius.'
p517
aS"But let's think about his argument for a minute. The argument was really not so much in"
p518
aS'favor of the Second Amendment. It was in favor of the right of self-defense. You are'
p519
aS"right. We all agree. There should be a right of self-defense. So don't you agree with me"
p520
aS'that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as'
p521
aS'"Everybody has the right of self-defense" -- then we could argue whether or not guns'
p522
aS'were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions.'
p523
aS'You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting,'
p524
aS'because hunting is not part of self-defense. The Second Amendment reads rather'
p525
aS'differently. It starts out by saying "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the'
p526
aS'security of a free state," then the right of the people to bear and keep arms. So, I think'
p527
aS'everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, "well-regulated'
p528
aS'militia," has outlived its usefulness. We do not have militias, state militias. They are as'
p529
aS"anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops. Now,"
p530
aS"that doesn't mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights. I don't want to amend"
p531
aS'the Third Amendment. I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third'
p532
aS"Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention. And he'll have people who"
p533
aS'might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth'
p534
aS'Amendment.'
p535
aS"So I'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the"
p536
aS'Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness. My point is'
p537
aS'it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the'
p538
aS'Constitution, the right of self-defense. Then we would have nothing to debate. We'
p539
aS'would all agree there is a right to self-defense. We would then be able to debate what'
p540
aS'the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what'
p541
aS'the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to'
p542
aS'be secure in their homes and places. But we have to distinguish between the primary'
p543
aS'right and the secondary right. The primary right should be the right of self-defense. Of'
p544
aS'course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the'
p545
aS'Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own'
p546
aS"weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's"
p547
aS'home or oneself?'
p548
aS'Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense? Would'
p549
aS'you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term "a well-'
p550
aS'regulated militia," and say, instead, "The right of self-defense, being necessary to the'
p551
aS'security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed."'
p552
aS"It seems to me, from Professor Volokh's argument, that he would support such an"
p553
aS'amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he would'
p554
aS'have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being'
p555
aS"essential. So I think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating --"
p556
aS'-- a new basic fundamental right --'
p557
aS"-- and then deriving the right that's in the Constitution from that fundamental right. And"
p558
aS'so, the question remains, what difference would it make? The difference is'
p559
aS'fundamental.'
p560
aS'I agree with you. Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions. Virtually every'
p561
aS'country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense. Four countries in the'
p562
aS'world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to'
p563
aS'bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of'
p564
aS'self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms. It seems to'
p565
aS"me that that's a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that"
p566
aS'the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate. And we should not'
p567
aS'federalize this constitutional right. We should not be the only leading industrial country'
p568
aS'in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms.'
p569
aS'What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common? What does'
p570
aS'Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common? They all have'
p571
aS'extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high'
p572
aS"death rates. I don't want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree"
p573
aS'here, the statistics cut both ways. You can make arguments in favor of the fact that'
p574
aS'guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a'
p575
aS'common sense way. Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and'
p576
aS'death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home. It cannot be a'
p577
aS'coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high'
p578
aS"murder rates. That just can't be a coincidence."
p579
aS'Yes there are cultural differences. To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is'
p580
aS'not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all'
p581
aS'the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities'
p582
aS'in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions,'
p583
aS'but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in?'
p584
aS'Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where'
p585
aS'the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns? Im'
p586
aS'reminded of the great episode from "All in the Family" where Archie Bunker gets to do'
p587
aS'an op-ed on television. And he says, "The way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking'
p588
aS'is very simple. Require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun. That way'
p589
aS'nobody will hijack an airplane." Do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a'
p590
aS'gun?'
p591
aS'And do you want to live in an America where everyone has a gun? If the answer to that'
p592
aS"question is no, let's acknowledge that the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic, has outlived"
p593
aS"its usefulness. Let's not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let's construe it"
p594
aS'reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self-'
p595
aS"defense, perhaps -- here I'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to"
p596
aS"have limited access to guns. That's my position. Thank you."

S"Thank you. Thank you. When I'm not in New York City, I spend just about all my waking"
p627
aS'hours in one particular case in a civil rights lawsuit in federal district court in Colorado'
p628
aS"where I represent 55 of Colorado's elected sheriffs who are suing against the"
p629
aS'unconstitutional extreme and highly immodest laws pushed down on Colorado by Mr.'
p630
aS"Bloomberg's successful lobbying last spring. In the United States Supreme Court I"
p631
aS'presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement'
p632
aS'organizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago.'
p633
aS'Included in that coalition are the two organizations -- national organizations of police'
p634
aS'trainers, the police who train the police. My clients, like the vast majority of law'
p635
aS'enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done,'
p636
aS'strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for'
p637
aS'law-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in'
p638
aS'the right hands substantially enhance public safety.'
p639
aS"What's some of the evidence for this belief? Well, in the United States, when a burglary"
p640
aS"takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home. It's"
p641
aS'called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary. In contrast, in England, the rate of'
p642
aS"home invasion burglaries is 59 percent. In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent. And this is"
p643
aS'because, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in their'
p644
aS'home and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in those'
p645
aS'other nations. Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut,'
p646
aS'and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars -- most burglars in the United States'
p647
aS'work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that'
p648
aS"there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do"
p649
aS'come in when somebody is home.'
p650
aS'And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that'
p651
aS'he will go to prison. And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary --'
p652
aS'and I certainly do -- then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value. The'
p653
aS'Centers for Disease Control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization. They conducted a'
p654
aS'national survey in 1994. They found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive'
p655
aS'gun uses against burglars. Usually, without -- in the United States. Usually without a shot'
p656
aS'even being fired. And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the'
p657
aS'burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early.'
p658
aS'Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they'
p659
aS'frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home. If you'
p660
aS'simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45'
p661
aS'percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million'
p662
aS'assaults every year in this country. That, by itself, would raise the national crime rate by'
p663
aS'nine percent. Guns are not only useful against burglars and for deterring burglars, but'
p664
aS'for self-defense in general. This summer the National Research Council and the Institute'
p665
aS'of Medicine -- two federal research centers -- at the request of President Obama, put'
p666
aS'together an expert panel of the leading social scientists on firearms policy issues to'
p667
aS'provide recommendations for what future topics need to be researched, and also, on'
p668
aS'what topics has consensus been achieved among social scientists.'
p669
aS'What they said in their report was that the social science is clear, that when a victim is'
p670
aS'attacked, using a firearm defensively leads to a lower rate of victim injury, to a lower'
p671
aS'rate of crime completion than any other protective strategy. It is the safest thing to do'
p672
aS'for the crime victim on a broadly -- broad-scaled statistical basis. And they also said the'
p673
aS'social science is clear, that guns are used at least for good, lawful, defensive purposes --'
p674
aS'at least as often as they are used for criminal purposes. Of course the benefit to law'
p675
aS'enforcement of this is enormous, in the fewer victimizations; the fewer crimes, the'
p676
aS'fewer people they have to respond to and help so they can help other people.'
p677
aS'Now, why is the Second Amendment necessary today? To protect people from local,'
p678
aS'bigoted governments. It was necessary in the civil rights era, when civil rights workers'

p734

p736
aS"not the same thing as a right to self-defense, and if we want a right to self-defense, let's"
p737
aS"put it in the constitution, but right now it's just not there. The team arguing against the"
p738
aS'motion, David Kopel and Eugene Volokh are trying to get you to vote against this motion'
p739
aS'that the right to bear arms has outlived its usefulness. They say the right to self-defense'
p740
aS'is a basic human right and so is access to the tools needed to carry out and execute that'
p741
aS'right. They say clearly that they believe that guns do deliver that self-defense and went'
p742
aS'through several examples of that, but they also say that it needs to be in the'
p743
aS"constitution, because there's a bigotry at the local level against gun ownership and it"
p744
aS'needs the protection of a constitutional amendment much in the same way as civil'

aS"probably about 300 million. Now, you might think that's good news or not, but that's"

p2562

p2565

S'Professor Dershowitz wants to re-litigate the constitutionality of the Civil War. Well,'
p2706
aS'that settled, actually, the question that we have for tonight in our political process. As of'
p2707
aS'1850, the Bill of Rights, as interpreted by federal courts, was only a limit on the federal'
p2708
aS'government and did not apply to the states. And then we had the Civil War, and the'
p2709
aS'terrible violations of the rights of the freedman that happened after the Civil War, when'
p2710
aS'the southern states abolished slavery in name, but tried to keep the freedmen in de'
p2711
aS'facto servitude and subjugation by saying they could only have public assemblies when'
p2712
aS'they got special permission, and by saying they needed special permission, if ever, that'
p2713
aS"they could possess firearms for protection. And again, that was part of the Ku Klux Klan's"
p2714
aS'strategy of disarming them. The country recognized that not only were the oppressions'
p2715
aS'of the freedmen under these black codes -- the new slave codes -- human rights'
p2716
aS'violations in themselves, but that the lack of civil liberty in the south had been one of'
p2717
aS'the important causes of the war, because it led to the suppression of speech, criticizing'
p2718
aS'slavery, and poisoned the political dialogue there.'
p2719
aS'And so, the country said we love diversity, we love the vastness of our country and the'
p2720
aS'different state experimentations, but some experiments are so dangerous that they lead'
p2721
aS'to catastrophe and we tried the experiment of saying well just leave it up to state'
p2722
aS'governments to protect civil liberties. Thats not enough. We need to set a national'
p2723
aS'baseline on human rights and the 14th Amendment was enacted to make the Bill of'
p2724
aS'Rights, including especially the First and Second Amendments, applicable to the states.'
p2725
aS'The baseline of the Second Amendment does not outlaw all gun control, and it allows'
p2726
aS'Montana to go much further in protecting gun rights than New York City does, but it'
p2727
aS'says everywhere that there are American citizens every government must respect the'
p2728
aS'baseline of the fundamental civil rights contained in our Bill of Rights.'

S'I ask you to vote for the motion based largely on what Professor Volokh has brilliantly'
p2749
aS'argued. He has conceded that he wouldnt include a militia in his model Bill of Rights. He'
p2750
aS'also has conceded that he wouldnt constitutionalize the right of hunting. By making'
p2751
aS'those two arguments, he has conceded the basic proposition: that the Second'
p2752
aS'Amendment the way its currently written is anachronistic and has outlived its'
p2753
aS'usefulness. He would substitute another amendment for that, an amendment much like'
p2754
aS'the one that he said was passed in Wisconsin. It seems to me that they have conceded'
p2755
aS'away the basic argument, namely that the Second Amendment as written is'
p2756
aS'anachronistic. Whats left?'
p2757
aS'Whats left is: do we really want militia groups that are armed today, and armed under'
p2758
aS'the Second Amendment, to have the right to confront our government and try to'
p2759
aS'conduct yet another revolution of the kind that we had back in the American Revolution'
p2760
aS'and the Civil War? It seems to me the answer to that is quite clearly no. Sigmund Freud'
p2761
aS'had a very famous statement back 100 years ago in which he said, The first human who'
p2762
aS'hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization. The First Amendment'
p2763
aS'protects insults. It does not protect stones, it does not protect violence. We could live'
p2764
aS'very comfortably with a First Amendment and without a Second Amendment. I dont'
p2765
aS'want to amend the Bill of Rights because I worry that other things could happen, but I'
p2766
aS'do want to make it very clear that the Second Amendment with its emphasis on militias'
p2767
aS'and hunting, and with no mention of self-defense has outlived its usefulness.'
p2768
aS'Therefore I urge you to vote yes and lets begin a debate on whether we should have an'
p2769
aS'amendment protecting the right of self-defense, not the right of guns.'
