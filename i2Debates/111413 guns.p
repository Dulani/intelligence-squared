p385
aS'Itwould just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number ofcriminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like,there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced.'
p386
aS"Mostenforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relativelylegitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity.It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposedthat I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds,but fortunately we're not here to debate that."
p387
aS'Nor do I think we are here to debate theone true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and aboutwhich indeed I have written.'
p388
aS'Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us,The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness.'
p389
aS"Now, one reason Irelish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I willadmit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because Ibelieve that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness.I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the onethat has most outlived its usefulness, but I'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in theBill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived theirusefulness."
p390
aS'So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantiverights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stufflike that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like?'
p391
aS'Would it include asubstantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms?And I would argue that the answer is no.'
p392
aS'Let me also emphasize that this is a differentquestion from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms.'
p393
aS"Eugenehas written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current numberis, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and thatraises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the UnitedStates constitution as well."
p394
aS"Let me give you two principle reasons why aconstitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simplybe fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process todayis tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate thatwe need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners.So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived itsusefulness in the 21st century."
p395
aS'The first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal.'
p396
aS'That isto say, one of the anomalies -- sometimes very difficult to tell the players without ascorecard -- in the debate about gun rights.'
p397
aS'There are many people who definethemselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government thatbelieves in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems.'
p398
aS'Well, this is not necessarilywhat Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in theMcDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line.Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation.Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights.'
p399
aS'There are some states --or cities -- very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer differentexperiments.'

aS'Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the greatcities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far,far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say.'

p489
aS"They're all top scholars and I alsoreckon all of them as friends of mine.And so let me start with something I think we all agree on, on the panel."
p490
aS"And I thinkprobably virtually everybody -- perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, andthat is that there's a basic human right to self-defense."
p491
aS'And there are, of course,debates about the particular boundaries of that right.'
p492
aS"But there's a core to that rightthat every state in the union recognizes."
p493
aS"I'm sure it's well-recognized outside the U.S. aswell."
p494
aS"If somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape,kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself ifthat is necessary."
p495
aS'That is very broadly agreed on.'
p496
aS"And I think it's agreed on because it isa basic human right."
p497
aS"So I think there's little difference about that."
p498
aS"But then there's thequestion -- what does that right entail?"
p499
aS"And I want to argue that a right to self-defense,like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that arenecessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself.Let's take an example."
p500
aS'The right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether youwant to have children or not.'
p501
aS"Imagine somebody says oh sure, I'm all for that right, youcan use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method."
p502
aS"We wouldn't say that's aserious argument."
p503
aS"We'd say it's a parody of an argument, right?"
p504
aS"We'd say well ofcourse, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools thatare reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that."
p505
aS"That's not just for that right, it'salso for speech."
p506
aS"Your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it'sthe right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonablynecessary to effectively defend yourself."
p507
aS'And guns are reasonably are necessary toeffectively defend yourself.'
p508
aS'Our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defendourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, andeven if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficientlyruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with agun, often not by shooting it.'
p509
aS'The overwhelming majority of all defensive gun usersinvolve just threatening to use it.Just a couple of thought experiments.'
p510
aS"I'm sure some of you live in places -- in houseswhere on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol."
p511
aS'I suspect few of you live inhouses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol.'
p512
aS'I would be willingto bet that.'
p513
aS'So in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armedguards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled toessentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves.'
p514
aS"The right to beararms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone."
p515
aS"Ifthey are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allowspeople to do."
p516
aS"And I think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutionsspecifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's anindividual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism."
p517
aS'This datesback from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012,and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well.Now, some people may say well okay, fine.'
p518
aS"It's reasonable to say there's a presumptionin favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should berebuttable."
p519
aS"If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting gunswould protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there maybe, well, then we should do that."
p520
aS'Well, interesting argument, but there is no suchevidence.'
p521
aS'So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee ofscholars, of criminologists.'
p522
aS'They put out this very nice report.'
p523
aS'You can read it for freeonline.'
p524
aS"The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that eitherextra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer.Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result."
p525
aS"The other studies aswell from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun controlwork."
p526
aS'His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on whatwe know.'
p527
aS'Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions,but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges?'
p528
aS'Well, onereason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level,questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a varietyof other things we have taken them off of the federalism process.'
p529
aS'We have set them upas human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask thisquestion as to whether this makes sense.'
p530
aS'Well, I think the answer to that you have tothink practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our countrygiven the political realities.'
p531
aS"And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want?If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want?Now, if what you want -- so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you mightwant modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on sizeof large capacity magazines."
p532
aS'You have to decide what is it that you want.'
p533
aS"Now, if youwant the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to youwith the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the SecondAmendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived itsusefulness."
p534
aS"There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade."
p535
aS'There are 300million guns in the country.'
p536
aS"They're not just going away."
p537
aS'Criminals will have access tothem, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will becomecriminals because they will insist on retaining them.'
p538
aS"Aha, people say well, but that's notwhat we want, right?"
p539
aS"We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear.Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest guncontrols the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way."
p540
aS'Courtshave routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges.'
p541
aS"There's a wide range ofmodest gun controls."
p542
aS"To be sure, there's federal level in many states,though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legalconstraint.The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control -- somepeople think it should be."
p543
aS"But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn'tlikely to be."
p544
aS"But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendmentis your friend."
p545
aS'And any attempt to repeal it -- that is what your enemy would be.Because all of those people who have been assured, "Oh, I\'m not going to take awayyour guns.'
p546
aS'Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you\'re justparanoid" -- if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I thinkis the implication of the conclusion that it\'s outlived its usefulness would be, that wouldturn that all -- make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that\'swhat\'s going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns.'
p547
aS"So if you wantmodest gun controls -- I'm not saying you should -- but if you do, you should be arguingthat the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness."
p548
aS'Part of its usefulness --besides self-defense -- is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are notcoming for their guns, as so many people, including the president --'

p589
aS'This dates back from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012, and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well.'
p590
aS'Now, some people may say well okay, fine.'
p591
aS"It's reasonable to say there's a presumption in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be rebuttable."
p592
aS"If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there may be, well, then we should do that."
p593
aS'Well, interesting argument, but there is no such evidence.'
p594
aS'So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee of scholars, of criminologists.'
p595
aS'They put out this very nice report.'
p596
aS'You can read it for free online.'
p597
aS"The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer."
p598
aS'Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result.'
p599
aS"The other studies as well from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun control work."
p600
aS'His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what we know.'
p601
aS'Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions, but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges?'
p602
aS'Well, one reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level, questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process.'
p603
aS'We have set them up as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this question as to whether this makes sense.'
p604
aS'Well, I think the answer to that you have to think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country given the political realities.'
p605
aS'And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want?'
p606
aS"If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want?"
p607
aS'Now, if what you want -- so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size of large capacity magazines.'
p608
aS'You have to decide what is it that you want.'
p609
aS"Now, if you want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the Second Amendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness."
p610
aS"There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade."
p611
aS'There are 300 million guns in the country.'
p612
aS"They're not just going away."
p613
aS'Criminals will have access to them, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will become criminals because they will insist on retaining them.'
p614
aS"Aha, people say well, but that's not what we want, right?"
p615
aS"We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear."
p616
aS"Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun controls the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way."
p617
aS'Courts have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges.'
p618
aS"There's a wide range of modest gun controls."
p619
aS"To be sure, there's federal level in many states, though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal constraint."
p620
aS'The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control -- some people think it should be.'
p621
aS"But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't likely to be."
p622
aS"But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendment is your friend."
p623
aS'And any attempt to repeal it -- that is what your enemy would be.'
p624
aS'Because all of those people who have been assured, "Oh, I\'m not going to take away your guns.'
p625
aS'Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you\'re just paranoid" -- if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I think is the implication of the conclusion that it\'s outlived its usefulness would be, that would turn that all -- make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that\'s what\'s going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns.'
p626
aS"So if you want modest gun controls -- I'm not saying you should -- but if you do, you should be arguing that the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness."
p627
aS'Part of its usefulness -- besides self-defense -- is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president --'

aS'What a great and powerful argument.'
p683
aS'No wonder he is considered a genius.'
p684
aS"But let's think about his argument for a minute."
p685
aS'The argument was really not so much in favor of the Second Amendment.'
p686
aS'It was in favor of the right of self-defense.'
p687
aS'You are right.'
p688
aS'We all agree.'
p689
aS'There should be a right of self-defense.'
p690
aS'So don\'t you agree with me that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as "Everybody has the right of self-defense" -- then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions.'
p691
aS'You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting, because hunting is not part of self-defense.'
p692
aS'The Second Amendment reads rather differently.'
p693
aS'It starts out by saying "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state," then the right of the people to bear and keep arms.'
p694
aS'So, I think everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, "well-regulated militia," has outlived its usefulness.'
p695
aS'We do not have militias, state militias.'
p696
aS"They are as anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops."
p697
aS"Now, that doesn't mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights."
p698
aS"I don't want to amend the Third Amendment."
p699
aS'I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention.'
p700
aS"And he'll have people who might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment."
p701
aS"So I'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness."
p702
aS'My point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the Constitution, the right of self-defense.'
p703
aS'Then we would have nothing to debate.'
p704
aS'We would all agree there is a right to self-defense.'
p705
aS'We would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places.'
p706
aS'But we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right.'
p707
aS'The primary right should be the right of self-defense.'
p708
aS"Of course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's home or oneself?"
p709
aS'Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense?'
p710
aS'Would you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term "a well- regulated militia," and say, instead, "The right of self-defense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed.'
p711
aS'" It seems to me, from Professor Volokh\'s argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he would have preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being essential.'
p712
aS"So I think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating -- -- a new basic fundamental right -- -- and then deriving the right that's in the Constitution from that fundamental right."
p713
aS'And so, the question remains, what difference would it make?'
p714
aS'The difference is fundamental.'
p715
aS'I agree with you.'
p716
aS'Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions.'
p717
aS'Virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense.'
p718
aS'Four countries in the world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms.'
p719
aS"It seems to me that that's a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate."
p720
aS'And we should not federalize this constitutional right.'
p721
aS'We should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms.'
p722
aS'What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common?'
p723
aS'What does Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common?'
p724
aS'They all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates.'
p725
aS"I don't want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways."
p726
aS'You can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way.'
p727
aS'Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home.'
p728
aS'It cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates.'
p729
aS"That just can't be a coincidence."
p730
aS'Yes there are cultural differences.'
p731
aS'To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do all the comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions, but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in?'
p732
aS'Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns?'
p733
aS'Im reminded of the great episode from "All in the Family" where Archie Bunker gets to do an op-ed on television.'

p740
aS"Let's not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let's construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self- defense, perhaps -- here I'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns."

aS'In the United States Supreme Court I presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement organizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago.'
p834
aS'Included in that coalition are the two organizations -- national organizations of police trainers, the police who train the police.'
p835
aS'My clients, like the vast majority of law enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done, strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in the right hands substantially enhance public safety.'
p836
aS"What's some of the evidence for this belief?"
p837
aS'Well, in the United States, when a burglary takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home.'
p838
aS"It's called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary."
p839
aS'In contrast, in England, the rate of home invasion burglaries is 59 percent.'
p840
aS"In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent."
p841
aS'And this is because, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in their home and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in those other nations.'
p842
aS"Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars -- most burglars in the United States work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do come in when somebody is home."
p843
aS'And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that he will go to prison.'
p844
aS'And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary -- and I certainly do -- then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value.'
p845
aS'The Centers for Disease Control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization.'
p846
aS'They conducted a national survey in 1994.'
p847
aS'They found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive gun uses against burglars.'
p848
aS'Usually, without -- in the United States.'
p849
aS'Usually without a shot even being fired.'
p850
aS'And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early.'
p851
aS'Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home.'
p852
aS'If you simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45 percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million assaults every year in this country.'
p853

p889
aS'In the United States Supreme Court Ipresented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcementorganizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago.Included in that coalition are the two organizations -- national organizations of policetrainers, the police who train the police.'
p890
aS"My clients, like the vast majority of lawenforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done,strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult forlaw-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns inthe right hands substantially enhance public safety.What's some of the evidence for this belief?"
p891
aS'Well, in the United States, when a burglarytakes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home.'
p892
aS"It'scalled a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary."
p893
aS'In contrast, in England, the rate ofhome invasion burglaries is 59 percent.'
p894
aS"In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent."
p895
aS'And this isbecause, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in theirhome and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in thoseother nations.'
p896
aS"Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut,and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars -- most burglars in the United Stateswork quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure thatthere's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they docome in when somebody is home.And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk thathe will go to prison."
p897
aS'And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary --and I certainly do -- then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value.'
p898
aS'TheCenters for Disease Control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization.'

aS'Usually without a shoteven being fired.'
p903
aS'And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted theburglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early.Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they [[laughter]] frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home.'
p904
aS'If yousimply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half millionassaults every year in this country.'
