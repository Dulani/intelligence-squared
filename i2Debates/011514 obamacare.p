S'When it comes to Obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well beyond the internet.'
p370
aS'Theyre imbedded in the structure of the law and theyll become more acute as this scheme unfolds.'
p371
aS'Obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts that turn the proposals against the legislations own laudible goals.'
p372
aS'Simply put, its a plan at war with its own ambitions.'
p373
aS'And tonight I want to briefly address some of the paradoxes embedded in this law.'
p374
aS'First, Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive.'
p375
aS'A big reason is provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around hospitals.'
p376
aS"Having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care, and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals."
p377
aS"We've basically built in a subsidy of that excess capacity."
p378
aS"And we also know that there's ample evidence that when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospital-owned systems, productivity falls."
p379
aS'And when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices.'
p380
aS'Second, the law seeks to increase competition between insurers its partly seen as a way to lower costs, but Obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and leave you with fewer choices.'
p381
aS'For one thing, Obamacare taps the operating margins of health plans.'
p382
aS'This basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the expense of new start-ups and new entrants.'
p383
aS'Obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package.'
p384
aS'The result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they can choose from.'
p385
aS"Go on the website and take a look for yourself and I'm putting out some data on this next week."
p386
aS'If you look at the health plans that insurance companies sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the same.'
p387
aS"It doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum plan."
p388
aS"By buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your co-pays and deductibles."
p389
aS"In other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your out-of-pocket costs."
p390
aS'There is no competition between these plans based on benefits or networks.'
p391
aS'There is no real choice in these exchanges.'
p392
aS'Third, Obamacare is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured Americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured who get coverage under this scheme will end up on Medicaid.'
p393
aS'And so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the Obamacare exchanges?'
p394
aS"They're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the individual or small-group markets and got moved into Obamacare, some of them forcibly."
p395
aS"But don't take my word for this."
p396
aS'Look at the numbers being put out by the administration.'
p397
aS'The White House says that 19 million people will be added to Medicaid.'
p398
aS"That's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people will get Obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four million."
p399
aS'But we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to conform.'
p400
aS'And as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200 percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year -- Obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies.'
p401
aS'And so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even after the subsidies, to buy that coverage.'
p402
aS"That's $5,000 a month."
p403
aS"And they're getting a plan with a $3,000 deductible."
p404
aS"The problem is that's not a good plan for that family."
p405
aS'And the problem is that these plans were designed in Washington to meet political aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed.'
p406
aS'And think about this.'
p407
aS'There were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when President Obama took office.'
p408
aS'This year, there were 48 million uninsured Americans.'
p409
aS'The only way the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured Americans than when his term began is by obligating more people to Medicaid.'
p410
aS'Obamacare is really a Medicaid law.'
p411
aS'And so, it begs the question, what about Medicaid?'
p412
aS'There is now ample evidence in the clinical literature that people on Medicaid are experiencing worse health outcomes than people in other insurance schemes.'
p413
aS'And sometimes even in the uninsured.'
p414
aS"Simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the Medicaid program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper."
p415
aS"I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes."
p416
aS"This doesn't seem moral."
p417
aS'Yet Obamacare does almost nothing to fix that Medicaid.'
p418
aS'It just pushes more people to an already failing system.'
p419
aS'In many ways, these problems that plague Medicaid will also plague Obamacare.'
p420
aS'Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid.'
p421
aS'And Obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered.'
p422
aS"And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the Obamacare plans."
p423
aS"This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard."
p424
aS'Obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system.'
p425
aS"There's no question about that."
p426
aS'But it makes things worse.'
p427
aS'It reduces choice and competition in health plans.'
p428
aS'It increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine.'
p429
aS"And finally, it only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a Medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health."
p430
aS'In all of these ways, Obamacare works again its own laudable intentions.'
p431
aS'There are far better ways to address issues of the uninsured in this country and far better ways to address the issues of those who are priced out of the insurance market.'

p535
aS'The motion that you\'ve heard is "Obamacare is now beyond rescue.'
p536
aS"What you heard Dr. Gottlieb argue is not that it's beyond rescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law."
p537
aS"What we're here to discuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed."
p538
aS"And the proposed was either Obamacare is now beyond rescue -- meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do - - or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do."
p539
aS"My partner, Jonathan Chait, and I will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn't need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working."
p540
aS"And to understand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the law was passed and what the goals of the law were."
p541
aS"I'll cover that."
p542
aS'And Jonathan will also discuss the achievements of Obamacare.'
p543
aS"But he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard many from the opponents of the law."
p544
aS"Speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back to some of the ones we heard."
p545
aS"But there are a few, I think, that we'll have to deal with sooner rather than later."
p546
aS'Let me first turn to the question about Obamacare and what it does.'
p547
aS"It's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and quality improvements as well."
p548
aS'I want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the question occurs, why is health insurance important?'
p549
aS'There are a lot of studies that show a lot of reasons for it.'
p550
aS'Some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less likely to miss their shots.'
p551
aS"And if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to miss them."
p552
aS'Healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other preventive services that they need.'
p553
aS"People who have diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly."
p554
aS'They tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, they tend to be more severe.'
p555
aS'But just as important in terms of outcomes besides health, people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by it in this system that we had until very recently.'
p556
aS'This led a group at the Institute of Medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless illness, needless suffering, and needless death.'
p557
aS"Let's turn the clock back a little bit to 2008, 2009 when this law was being debated."
p558
aS'At that time, we had 40 to 45 million people uninsured.'
p559
aS'We were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and health care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in the developed world.'
p560
aS"In addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at that time didn't have portability."
p561
aS'If you lost your job, you often lost your insurance.'
p562
aS"You didn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get health insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it."
p563
aS'And there were no national standards for insurance policies.'
p564
aS'We were largely -- not exclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really pushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more you did, the more you got paid.'
p565
aS"And so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care could've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent."
p566
aS'And equally important were the projections -- and this is just now four years ago -- the projections of where we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing had been done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending going from trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000 to average 30,000 a year, Medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in that fee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and not necessarily better.'
p567
aS'So in March 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedly imperfect law, but not just insurance , quality improvement, cost reductions.'
p568
aS'What are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of this law?'
p569
aS"Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies, and three million have."
p570
aS'Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage.'
p571
aS"There's portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it doesn't raise the rates for everybody."
p572
aS"No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's evidence based."
p573
aS"Also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services they deliver."
p574
aS"There are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's discharged and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards."
p575
aS'Something called accountable care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and there are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation.'
p576
aS'Importantly, cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically.'
p577
aS'That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent in the past three years, 2010 to 2012.'
p578
aS"So in summary, before this year, before anything that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of Obamacare."
p579
aS'Then we come to October 2013.'
p580
aS'Everyone knows, what a disaster.'
p581
aS'Okay?'
p582
aS"People can't sign up."
p583
aS"The computer systems don't work."
p584
aS"The website's a mess."
p585
aS"There's lots of confusion."
p586
aS'Some provisions of the law were postponed.'
p587
aS"But even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently."
p588
aS"Six million enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in Medicaid -- we'll come back to Medicaid -- people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies to help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate ."
p589
aS"Let me conclude now by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we are now."
p590
aS'I want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers, a satirical newspaper called The Onion.'
p591
aS'The headline was, "Nation Recalls Simpler Time When Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair.'
p592
aS'" Here\'s the quote, "Back then, if you couldn\'t afford health care insurance and got really sick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple," said a Modesto , California, mother of three.'
p593
aS'"You didn\'t have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income.'
p594
aS"People didn't have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went ahead and died of preventable causes."

S'Thanks, John, and thanks for inviting me.'
p606
aS'The motion that you\'ve heard is "Obamacareis now beyond rescue.'
p607
aS"What you heard Dr. Gottlieb argue is not that it's beyondrescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law."
p608
aS"What we're here todiscuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed."
p609
aS"And the proposed was eitherObamacare is now beyond rescue -- meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do -- or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do."
p610
aS"My partner,Jonathan Chait, and I will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn'tneed to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working."
p611
aS"And tounderstand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the lawwas passed and what the goals of the law were."
p612
aS"I'll cover that."
p613
aS"And Jonathan will alsodiscuss the achievements of Obamacare.But he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard manyfrom the opponents of the law."
p614
aS"Speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back tosome of the ones we heard."
p615
aS"But there are a few, I think, that we'll have to deal withsooner rather than later."
p616
aS'Let me first turn to the question about Obamacare and what itdoes.'
p617
aS"It's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and qualityimprovements as well."
p618
aS'I want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the questionoccurs, why is health insurance important?'
p619
aS'There are a lot of studies that show a lot ofreasons for it.'
p620
aS'Some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are lesslikely to miss their shots.'
p621
aS"And if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to missthem."
p622
aS'Healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and otherpreventive services that they need.'
p623
aS"People who have diseases such as diabetes andhypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly.They tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, theytend to be more severe."
p624
aS'But just as important in terms of outcomes besides health,people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted byit in this system that we had until very recently.'
p625
aS'This led a group at the Institute ofMedicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needlessillness, needless suffering, and needless death.'
p626
aS"Let's turn the clock back a little bit to2008, 2009 when this law was being debated."
p627
aS'At that time, we had 40 to 45 millionpeople uninsured.'
p628
aS'We were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health andhealth care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes inthe developed world.'
p629
aS"In addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at thattime didn't have portability."
p630
aS'If you lost your job, you often lost your insurance.'
p631
aS"Youdidn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to gethealth insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it.And there were no national standards for insurance policies."
p632
aS'We were largely -- notexclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives reallypushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more youdid, the more you got paid.'
p633
aS"And so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary carecould've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent."
p634
aS'And equallyimportant were the projections -- and this is just now four years ago -- the projections ofwhere we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing hadbeen done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending goingfrom trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000to average 30,000 a year, Medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in thatfee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and notnecessarily better.So in March 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed,Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedlyimperfect law, but not just insurance , quality improvement, costreductions.'
p635
aS'What are some of the things that have happened in the first three years ofthis law?'
p636
aS"Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies,and three million have."
p637
aS'Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage.'
p638
aS"There'sportability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means ifyou're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, itdoesn't raise the rates for everybody."
p639
aS"No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and insome ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that'sevidence based.Also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the servicesthey deliver."
p640
aS"There are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's dischargedand then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards."
p641
aS'Something called accountablecare organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and thereare many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called theCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation.'
p642
aS'Importantly, cost reforms have sloweddown cost dramatically.'
p643
aS'That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percentin the past three years, 2010 to 2012.'
p644
aS"So in summary, before this year, before anythingthat's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good thingsthat are going on because of Obamacare."
p645
aS'Then we come to October 2013.'
p646
aS'Everyoneknows, what a disaster.'
p647
aS'Okay?'
p648
aS"People can't sign up."
p649
aS"The computer systems don't work.The website's a mess."
p650
aS"There's lots of confusion."
p651
aS"Some provisions of the law werepostponed.But even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently."
p652
aS"Sixmillion enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in Medicaid -- we'll come back toMedicaid -- people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidiesto help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate ."
p653
aS"Let me concludenow by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we arenow."
p654
aS'I want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers,a satirical newspaper called The Onion.'
p655
aS'The headline was, "Nation Recalls Simpler TimeWhen Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair.'
p656
aS'"Here\'s the quote, "Back then, if you couldn\'t afford health care insurance and got reallysick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple," said a Modesto , California, mother of three.'
p657
aS'"You didn\'t have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you mightor might not qualify for based on your income.People didn\'t have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went aheadand died of preventable causes.'

S"To hear Doug Kamerow describe it, it's amazing, and I want to sign up."
p688
aS'But, you know,these debates often tend to sort of devolve into "Who doesn\'t want people to die?'
p689
aS'"So that\'s not actually what\'s on the table here.'
p690
aS'The issue is not "Are DemocratsSocialists?'
p691
aS'Are Republicans stupid and venal and terrible people?'
p692
aS'" The issue is, "Is thislaw, Obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do?'
p693
aS'Is it making Americans better off,and can it survive in its current form?'
p694
aS'" As you listen to the administration, it\'simpossible for Obamacare to fail because every time they don\'t hit some number thatthey\'ve been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success aswhatever\'s already happened.'
p695
aS"So, for example, just a few months ago, KathleenSebelius, who's the secretary of Health and Human Services, was saying that success inthe exchanges was seven million people signed up by March 2014."
p696
aS"And then they had afew problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn't having sevenmillion people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool -- inthe insurance pools on the exchanges.Then they said that we got -- needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults,which is between the ages of 18 and 35."
p697
aS'And then we got some data on thedemographics.'
p698
aS"And so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who've signed up areyoung adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a fewreasons that should be fairly obvious, could make insurance cost a lot more than wewere hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would besigning up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right,of however many people you've signed up is the number that was possible."
p699
aS"It's the self-licking ice cream cone of policy programs."
p700
aS"But for the rest of us, I don't think it's enoughfor Obamacare to merely exist."
p701
aS'It has to actually do something and do something thatwe want.'
p702
aS'So what did we want?'
p703
aS'What were we promised?'
p704
aS"We were promised lowercosts for government and individuals, and we've heard some of that.The administration likes to claim that this has already happened."
p705
aS"This hasn't."
p706
aS'Healthcare cost growth has indeed slowed, but health care cost growth started slowing in 2004when Barack Obama was a junior state senator from Illinois.'
p707
aS'He had not even beenelected to the U.S. Senate, much less to the presidency.'
p708
aS'You see a big decline in 2005 to2007 -- in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in2010 right when Obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if youlook at the OECD figures on that.'
p709
aS'Kaiser projects -- you remember we heard that theaverage family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums?'
p710
aS"That didn't happen.Kaiser is now projecting that premiums will go up."
p711
aS'We wanted people to get healthieras a result of this law, but then we got the Oregon Medicaid Study, which is the goldstandard in studies of Medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to lookat, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and itshowed no statistically significant results.More than half of the expansion in Obamacare comes through Medicaid.'
p712
aS'We wantedpeople with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexistingconditions we were told were out there to be able to buy insurance.'
p713
aS'But when they setup pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting toget 400,000 people between 2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number,and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing anaggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up.'
p714
aS'And we wanted expandedhealth care coverage, right?'
p715
aS"But at this point, we can't even say that there are morepeople insured right now than there were on January 15, 2013."
p716
aS"We -- theadministration says that there have been four million people added to Medicaid, buthalf of those people came in states that didn't even do the Medicaid expansion."
p717
aS'Sodefinitionally they were already eligible for Medicaid.'
p718
aS"Of the other states, some ofthose people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage.The administration can't even say that these are people who are getting new coverage.Some of them may just be going back on to Medicaid just like they were last year."
p719
aS'Wehave 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policiescancelled.'
p720
aS"No one, I think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn'teven know whether we've increased the insurance numbers and the administrationrefuses to certify that that is actually happening."
p721
aS'Meanwhile, we were not supposed tohurt anyone who had insurance, right?'
p722
aS'If you liked your plan and you liked your doctor,you could keep them.'
p723
aS'We all know that that has not happened, so five million peoplehave had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeingthat their doctors are not -- the best hospitals and doctors in their area have beenkicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges.'

p856
aS"So when you hear about the problems that our opponents are describingin the law, they had to delay this, they had to fix this, the Spanish language websitedidn't work as well as they wanted the first day."

p858
aS"They said, oh, we didn't quite get the counters we want."
p859
aS'Oh, this went alittle bit over cost.'
p860
aS'Well, then you have to ask -- to answer that question you have to askwhat kind of endeavor is Obamacare?Is the Obama administration trying to build a moon base?'
p861
aS'Is the Obama administrationtrying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile Muslim country?'
p862
aS'No.'
p863
aS"Whatthey're trying to do is build a national health insurance plan."
p864
aS'Can you build a nationalhealth insurance plan?'
p865
aS'Well, every advanced economy in the world, except the UnitedStates, has built a national health insurance plan.'
p866
aS'All of those countries insure all theircitizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the United States.'
p867
aS'Soyoure a priori assumption has to be yeah, this is something you can basically do that theproblems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself, but theproblems you have any time you go through any major project.'
p868
aS'So, what our opponentshave been trying to do for months, and months, and months, actually is paint thispicture where every time the contractor comes to you and says, "Oh, it turns out theydon\'t have this color, oh, it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day," it meansthe whole thing is going to collapse on its own.But actually, nothing like that is happening at all.'
p869
aS'And there is no evidence that anythinglike this is happening.'

aS'The main argument that the opponents have been making theentire time is that there is going to be a death spiral.'
p871
aS"That's the only plausiblemechanism that they have, that the law will fail."
p872
aS"A death spiral is a term that I expectedthem to talk about, because that's what they've been talking about for months."
p873
aS"It'ssomething they've barely invoked at all."
p874
aS"And I think the reason is it's become clear, inrecent days, that there's no chance of a death spiral in the Obamacare law."
p875
aS'A deathspiral is when you have too many old, sick people who drive up the cost, making thepremiums more expensive, leading the healthy people to flee, driving up costs more.That is theoretically possible, but is not something that can possibly happen in this law.In fact, if you want to say, "Is the law succeeding?'
p876
aS'" you don\'t have to ask theadministration.'
p877
aS'You could ask the insurers, right?'
p878
aS"Because the insurers have recentlybeen saying they're very happy with the mix of people -- the mix of people you have inthe exchanges is sound."
p879
aS"It's sustainable."
p880
aS'They don\'t need -- they don\'t need it tochange.They\'ve got a mix of people that\'s healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward.What\'s more, even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than theyexpect, you had -- the Kaiser Health Foundation ran the numbers and said, "What\'s theworst-case scenario?'
p881
aS'" We don\'t get any increase in young people at all.'
p882
aS'And they said itwould be about a 2.4 percent increase in premiums 2.4 percent increase in healthinsurance premiums.'
p883
aS'If any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a 2.4percent increase over your bill last year, you\'d say, "Thank God it\'s only a 2.4 percentincrease," right?'
p884
aS"That's a rounding error."
p885
aS'No one notices 2.4 percent.'
p886
aS"That couldn'tpossibly set off a death spiral."
p887
aS"So there's really no plausible mechanism that the lawcould fail."
p888
aS"So I think what they're giving you -- instead of what used to be the plausiblemechanism for which the -- this can fail, they're giving you a mix of wishes and hopesand completely debunked facts."
p889
aS'They said, "Cost growth leveled after 2010.'
p890
aS'No.'
p891
aS'Costgrowth in 2012 was lower than at any year in 50 years.'
p892
aS'And in fact -- this is importantbecause when the law was passed, cost growth was the main thing they talked about.Obamacare was supposed to control costs.'
p893
aS'And they said, "No, no, it\'s going to makecosts explode with all this bureaucracy regulation.'
p894
aS"They're going to go out of control.What happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimisticestimates believed it would be before the law was signed."
p895
aS'And so now, they\'re reduced-- instead of saying, "This disaster of cost growth is going to happen," they\'re going tosay, "This incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence.'
p896
aS"So, all they'resaying is essentially that this wonderful thing that's happened has nothing to do withthe gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to thelowest level in 50 years."
p897
aS"And you can't prove that it's not a coincidence."
p898
aS'But you haveto -- see, this is indicative of the mentality we\'re dealing with, where it simply movesfrom one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario.So you have to wonder, "Why are they simple moving from one disaster scenario toanother disaster scenario?'
p899
aS'"Actually, I wanted to debunk a couple points they made, because a lot of this is just --we\'ve heard from the other side -- are not true.'
p900
aS"I can't give you links and charts todebunk them, but let me say that it's not the case that 5 million policies have beencanceled."
p901
aS"That's a number that was floating about that you can't verify."

aS"They can't actually prove that either, but for various reasons, you don'thave a good enough count."
p907
aS"This -- that's almost certainly nowhere close to 5 million.And that's a big number that's -- they're citing because they're saying, that -- those arethe losers."
p908
aS"But it's really nowhere close to that."
p909
aS"Yet they say -- Megan said we can't --we can't say for sure how many -- how -- that there are more insured now than therewere before."
p910
aS"We can't say for sure, because again, this number can't exactly becounted."
p911

p912
aS"But we know it's not anywhereclose to 5 million."
p913
aS"And it's a mortal certainty that far more people have healthinsurance now than would have had in absence of the law.So why are we having this kind of lurch, from one argument, abandoning thesearguments when they disappear, and simply coming up with new ones?"
p914
aS'The truth is,they disagree with the goals of the law.'
p915
