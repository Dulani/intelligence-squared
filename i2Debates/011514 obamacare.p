aS'they pay a premium, they got their coverage, from the other side, how does the'

p44
aS'Robert Rosenkranz'
p45
aS'Okay. Let me start with an analogy. If you go to buy a car, the car dealer knows exactly'
p46
aS'what that car cost him and, therefore, can charge you a price that reflects that cost plus'
p47
aS'profit.'
p48
aS"When you're buying car insurance, the insurance company does not know how much it's"
p49
aS'going to cost, how many accidents you might have or what the cost is fixing them. So'
p50
aS'the insurance company is setting a price tag, but they have to make an intelligent guess'
p51
aS'about what their future losses are going to be. And in the case of car insurance, for'
p52
aS'example, an intelligent guess is that young drivers are going to have more accidents,'
p53
aS'that cars that are poorly maintained are going to have more accidents, et cetera, et'
p54
aS'cetera.'
p55
aS'And the pricing reflects that. Young drivers pay higher premiums because historically'
p56
aS'they are not as good at, say, driving.'
p57
aS'So how does health insurance work in that sense ?'

S'ROBERT ROSENKRANZ'
p93
sg13
(lp94
S"Well, that's kind of the point, is that a group of young people is going to have a different"
p95
aS'experience than a group of old people. And a group of sick people is going to have a'
p96
aS'very different experience than a group of well people. So as an insurance company'
p97
aS"you're providing insurance for individuals, you have to be sure or at least have a good"
p98
aS'reason to think that the individuals who show up to sign up for this insurance are a'
p99
aS"representative sample, that you're not just getting the bad risks."
p100
aS"And that's why, for example, this idea of preexisting conditions, which sounds kind of"
p101
aS'cruel, that insurance companies would evaluate coverage for my preexisting condition.'
p102
aS"But if they didn't have that rule, nobody would buy health insurance except when they"
p103
aS'get sick and then they rush to buy it. So taking that idea to the rollout here of'
p104
aS'Obamacare, part of the implication of difficulties of signing up is that the people who'
p105
aS'are most motivated, mainly older and sicker people, will run that gauntlet. The people'
p106
aS'who need the insurance less are finding it overpriced, like young healthy people, will not'
p107
aS"go to that trouble. And that's what's meant by adverse selection. And if I were the"

S'When it comes to Obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the'
p288
aS'problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well'
p289
aS'beyond the internet. Theyre imbedded in the structure of the law and theyll become'
p290
aS'more acute as this scheme unfolds. Obamacare rests on some deeply flawed concepts'
p291
aS'that turn the proposals against the legislations own laudible goals. Simply put, its a'
p292
aS'plan at war with its own ambitions. And tonight I want to briefly address some of the'
p293
aS'paradoxes embedded in this law.'
p294
aS'First, Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new'
p295
aS'arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive. A big reason is'
p296
aS'provisions that deliberately force doctors to consolidate their medical practices around'
p297
aS'hospitals. Having doctors work for hospitals is often the costliest way to deliver care,'
p298
aS"and we know there's a lot of excess capacity in hospitals. We've basically built in a"
p299
aS"subsidy of that excess capacity. And we also know that there's ample evidence that"
p300
aS'when physicians become the employees of hospitals and hospital-owned systems,'
p301
aS'productivity falls. And when hospitals buy up local physicians in a community, enabling'
p302
aS'them to exercise monopoly pricing power, they raise prices. Second, the law seeks to'
p303
aS'increase competition between insurers its partly seen as a way to lower costs, but'
p304
aS'Obamacare will actually reduce the number of health plans in the marketplace and'
p305
aS'leave you with fewer choices. For one thing, Obamacare taps the operating margins of'
p306
aS'health plans. This basically protects the businesses of incumbent insurers at the'
p307
aS'expense of new start-ups and new entrants.'
p308
aS'Obamacare also uses regulation to prescribe a single uniform benefit package. The'
p309
aS'result is that consumers are left with just one option when it comes to the benefits they'
p310
aS"can choose from. Go on the website and take a look for yourself and I'm putting out"
p311
aS'some data on this next week. If you look at the health plans that insurance companies'
p312
aS'sell on the exchanges, the provider networks and the drug formularies are exactly the'
p313
aS"same. It doesn't matter if you buy a plan that's a bronze plan, a gold plan, or a platinum"
p314
aS"plan. By buying up to a costlier plan, all you're doing is lowering your co-pays and"
p315
aS"deductibles. In other words, you're just fronting a higher premium to buy down your"
p316
aS'out-of-pocket costs. There is no competition between these plans based on benefits or'
p317
aS'networks. There is no real choice in these exchanges. Third, Obamacare is aimed at'
p318
aS'reducing the number of uninsured Americans, but the vast majority of the uninsured'
p319
aS'who get coverage under this scheme will end up on Medicaid.'
p320
aS'And so what about the people who sign up for private coverage in the Obamacare'
p321
aS"exchanges? They're going to mostly be people who were previously insured in the"
p322
aS'individual or small-group markets and got moved into Obamacare, some of them'
p323
aS"forcibly. But don't take my word for this. Look at the numbers being put out by the"
p324
aS'administration. The White House says that 19 million people will be added to Medicaid.'
p325
aS"That's a 35 percent increase in the size of the program, but at best, five million people"
p326
aS"will get Obamacare coverage this year and it's probably going to be closer to four"
p327
aS'million. But we know at least five million people lost their policies when the mandates'
p328
aS'of this law were imposed on a private market and insurers had to drop old plans to'
p329
aS'conform. And as for the uninsured, the lower middle class folks, for people above 200'
p330
aS'percent of the federal poverty level, family of four earning about $50,000 a year --'
p331
aS'Obamacare is still too expensive for them, even with the benefits and the subsidies.'
p332
aS'And so, a family of four earning $50,000 a year will have to pay $400 a month, even'
p333
aS"after the subsidies, to buy that coverage. That's $5,000 a month. And they're getting a"
p334
aS"plan with a $3,000 deductible. The problem is that's not a good plan for that family."
p335
aS'And the problem is that these plans were designed in Washington to meet political'
p336
aS'aspirations rather than marketplace, to meet the demand of what consumers needed.'
p337
aS'And think about this. There were 46.3 million uninsured in 2008, when President'
p338
aS'Obama took office. This year, there were 48 million uninsured Americans. The only way'
p339
aS'the president is going to leave office with fewer uninsured Americans than when his'
p340
aS'term began is by obligating more people to Medicaid. Obamacare is really a Medicaid'
p341
aS'law. And so, it begs the question, what about Medicaid? There is now ample evidence'
p342
aS'in the clinical literature that people on Medicaid are experiencing worse health'
p343
aS'outcomes than people in other insurance schemes. And sometimes even in the'
p344
aS'uninsured. Simply put, reimbursement rates have been driven so low in the Medicaid'
p345
aS"program that folks can't get access to the benefits that they're promised on paper."
p346
aS"I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this"
p347
aS'country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally'
p348
aS"worsening medical outcomes. This doesn't seem moral. Yet Obamacare does almost"
p349
aS'nothing to fix that Medicaid. It just pushes more people to an already failing system.'
p350
aS'In many ways, these problems that plague Medicaid will also plague Obamacare.'
p351
aS'Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these'
p352
aS'commitments is to reduce what providers are paid. And Obamacare, this is now a'
p353
aS'network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that'
p354
aS"leave key medicines uncovered. And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the"
p355
aS"Obamacare plans. This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's"
p356
aS'benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard. Obamacare was a'
p357
aS"response to a flawed healthcare system. There's no question about that. But it makes"
p358
aS'things worse. It reduces choice and competition in health plans.'
p359
aS'It increases costs by reducing the productivity of the practice of medicine. And finally, it'
p360
aS'only reduces the number of uninsured by obligating millions of more people to a'
p361
aS"Medicaid benefit that's quite literally harming people's health. In all of these ways,"
p362
aS'Obamacare works again its own laudable intentions. There are far better ways to'

S'Thanks, John, and thanks for inviting me. The motion that you\'ve heard is "Obamacare'
p399
aS"is now beyond rescue. What you heard Dr. Gottlieb argue is not that it's beyond"
p400
aS"rescue, it's that he doesn't like a lot of the provisions of the law. What we're here to"
p401
aS'discuss, it seems to me, is what has been in the proposed. And the proposed was either'
p402
aS"Obamacare is now beyond rescue -- meaning it's not doing what it was supposed to do -"
p403
aS'- or it is not beyond rescue, and therefore it is doing what it can do. My partner,'
p404
aS"Jonathan Chait, and I will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue, it doesn't"
p405
aS'need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working. And to'
p406
aS"understand whether it's working, we need to understand where we were before the law"
p407
aS"was passed and what the goals of the law were. I'll cover that. And Jonathan will also"
p408
aS'discuss the achievements of Obamacare.'
p409
aS"But he'll focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which we've already heard many"
p410
aS"from the opponents of the law. Speaking of the dire predictions, we'll come back to"
p411
aS"some of the ones we heard. But there are a few, I think, that we'll have to deal with"
p412
aS'sooner rather than later. Let me first turn to the question about Obamacare and what it'
p413
aS"does. It's an insurance law, but of course it includes cost controls and quality"
p414
aS'improvements as well. I want to focus on the insurance stuff, because the question'
p415
aS'occurs, why is health insurance important? There are a lot of studies that show a lot of'
p416
aS'reasons for it. Some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less'
p417
aS"likely to miss their shots. And if they don't have insurance, they're more likely to miss"
p418
aS'them. Healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other'
p419
aS'preventive services that they need. People who have diseases such as diabetes and'
p420
aS"hypertension and they don't have insurance do poorly."
p421
aS'They tend to be more out of control, and if they have bad outcomes like strokes, they'
p422
aS'tend to be more severe. But just as important in terms of outcomes besides health,'
p423
aS'people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by'
p424
aS'it in this system that we had until very recently. This led a group at the Institute of'
p425
aS'Medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless'
p426
aS"illness, needless suffering, and needless death. Let's turn the clock back a little bit to"
p427
aS'2008, 2009 when this law was being debated. At that time, we had 40 to 45 million'
p428
aS'people uninsured. We were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and'
p429
aS'health care and growing, and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in'
p430
aS'the developed world. In addition, most of the insurance products that we saw at that'
p431
aS"time didn't have portability. If you lost your job, you often lost your insurance. You"
p432
aS"didn't have guaranteed issue, so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get"
p433
aS"health insurance and you're not in a big group, forget about it."
p434
aS'And there were no national standards for insurance policies. We were largely -- not'
p435
aS'exclusively, but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really'
p436
aS'pushing towards more care, not better care, not the appropriate care, but the more you'
p437
aS'did, the more you got paid. And so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care'
p438
aS"could've been 10, even 20 percent of the money that was being spent. And equally"
p439
aS'important were the projections -- and this is just now four years ago -- the projections of'
p440
aS'where we are going to be by 2018, which is just four years from now, if nothing had'
p441
aS'been done, over 60 million people uninsured at that point, health care spending going'
p442
aS'from trillion to $4.7 trillion a year, family health care premiums going up from $13,000'
p443
aS'to average 30,000 a year, Medicare trust fund runs out of money, and no change in that'
p444
aS'fee for service culture that pays for more medicine, more health care, and not'
p445
aS'necessarily better.'
p446
aS'So in March 2010, which is now almost four years ago, we had this law signed,'
p447
aS'Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, hugely complex, admittedly, admittedly'
p448
aS'imperfect law, but not just insurance , quality improvement, cost'
p449
aS'reductions. What are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of'
p450
aS"this law? Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies,"
p451
aS"and three million have. Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage. There's"
p452
aS'portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if'
p453
aS"you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it"
p454
aS"doesn't raise the rates for everybody. No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in"
p455
aS"some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's"
p456
aS'evidence based.'
p457
aS"Also, cost related things, we're now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services"
p458
aS"they deliver. There are penalties for hospital readmissions when someone's discharged"
p459
aS'and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards. Something called accountable'
p460
aS'care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework, and there'
p461
aS'are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the'
p462
aS'Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Importantly, cost reforms have slowed'
p463
aS'down cost dramatically. That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent'
p464
aS'in the past three years, 2010 to 2012. So in summary, before this year, before anything'
p465
aS"that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things"
p466
aS'that are going on because of Obamacare. Then we come to October 2013. Everyone'
p467
aS"knows, what a disaster. Okay? People can't sign up. The computer systems don't work."
p468
aS"The website's a mess. There's lots of confusion. Some provisions of the law were"
p469
aS'postponed.'
p470
aS"But even conceding that all this was a mess, let's look what's happened recently. Six"
p471
aS"million enrollees, two million in exchanges, 4.4 million in Medicaid -- we'll come back to"
p472
aS'Medicaid -- people up to 400 percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies'
p473
aS'to help pay for insurance, and cost increases continue to moderate . Let me conclude'
p474
aS"now by asking you to remember where we were, where we've been, and where we are"
p475
aS'now. I want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers,'
p476
aS'a satirical newspaper called The Onion. The headline was, "Nation Recalls Simpler Time'
p477
aS'When Health Care System Was Broken Beyond Repair."'
p478
aS'Here\'s the quote, "Back then, if you couldn\'t afford health care insurance and got really'
p479
aS'sick, you went bankrupt, plain and simple," said a Modesto , California, mother of three.'
p480
aS'"You didn\'t have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might'
p481
aS'or might not qualify for based on your income.'
p482
aS"People didn't have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches, just went ahead"
p483
aS'and died of preventable causes."'

p513
aS'these debates often tend to sort of devolve into "Who doesn\'t want people to die?"'
p514
aS'So that\'s not actually what\'s on the table here. The issue is not "Are Democrats'
p515
aS'Socialists? Are Republicans stupid and venal and terrible people?" The issue is, "Is this'
p516
aS'law, Obamacare, accomplishing what it set out to do? Is it making Americans better off,'
p517
aS'and can it survive in its current form?" As you listen to the administration, it\'s'
p518
aS"impossible for Obamacare to fail because every time they don't hit some number that"
p519
aS"they've been promoting, they just change the terms and redefine its success as"
p520
aS"whatever's already happened. So, for example, just a few months ago, Kathleen"
p521
aS"Sebelius, who's the secretary of Health and Human Services, was saying that success in"
p522
aS'the exchanges was seven million people signed up by March 2014. And then they had a'
p523
aS"few problems with the exchanges, and then suddenly success wasn't having seven"
p524
aS'million people signed up, success was having a healthy demographic mix in the pool -- in'
p525
aS'the insurance pools on the exchanges.'
p526
aS'Then they said that we got -- needed about 40 percent of the people to be young adults,'
p527
aS'which is between the ages of 18 and 35. And then we got some data on the'
p528
aS"demographics. And so far about 20 to 25 percent of the people who've signed up are"
p529
aS'young adults, and we got many more old people than we expected, which, for a few'
p530
aS'reasons that should be fairly obvious, could make insurance cost a lot more than we'
p531
aS'were hoping, so in the most recent conference call, they said that success would be'
p532
aS'signing up as many people as possible, which is this beautifully circular reference, right,'
p533
aS"of however many people you've signed up is the number that was possible. It's the self-"
p534
aS"licking ice cream cone of policy programs. But for the rest of us, I don't think it's enough"
p535
aS'for Obamacare to merely exist. It has to actually do something and do something that'
p536
aS'we want. So what did we want? What were we promised? We were promised lower'
p537
aS"costs for government and individuals, and we've heard some of that."
p538
aS"The administration likes to claim that this has already happened. This hasn't. Health"
p539
aS'care cost growth has indeed slowed, but health care cost growth started slowing in 2004'
p540
aS'when Barack Obama was a junior state senator from Illinois. He had not even been'
p541
aS'elected to the U.S. Senate, much less to the presidency. You see a big decline in 2005 to'
p542
aS'2007 -- in 2003 to 2005, another between 2007 and 2009, but it actually leveled off in'
p543
aS'2010 right when Obamacare comes in and cost growth is kind of bumping along if you'
p544
aS'look at the OECD figures on that. Kaiser projects -- you remember we heard that the'
p545
aS"average family was going to save $2,500 a year on their premiums? That didn't happen."
p546
aS'Kaiser is now projecting that premiums will go up. We wanted people to get healthier'
p547
aS'as a result of this law, but then we got the Oregon Medicaid Study, which is the gold'
p548
aS'standard in studies of Medicaid, and it looked at the three things you really want to look'
p549
aS'at, in preventative care, it looked at hypertension control, cholesterol control, and it'
p550
aS'showed no statistically significant results.'
p551
aS'More than half of the expansion in Obamacare comes through Medicaid. We wanted'
p552
aS'people with preexisting conditions, all of these millions of people with preexisting'
p553
aS'conditions we were told were out there to be able to buy insurance. But when they set'
p554
aS'up pools in order to cover people with preexisting conditions, they were expecting to'
p555
aS'get 400,000 people between 2010 and 2013, instead they got a quarter of that number,'
p556
aS'and they only managed to get that by lowering their requirements and doing an'
p557
aS'aggressive outreach campaign to sign more people up. And we wanted expanded'
p558
aS"health care coverage, right? But at this point, we can't even say that there are more"
p559
aS'people insured right now than there were on January 15, 2013. We -- the'
p560
aS'administration says that there have been four million people added to Medicaid, but'
p561
aS"half of those people came in states that didn't even do the Medicaid expansion. So"
p562
aS'definitionally they were already eligible for Medicaid. Of the other states, some of'
p563
aS'those people were already eligible or may even be renewing their coverage.'
p564
aS"The administration can't even say that these are people who are getting new coverage."
p565
aS'Some of them may just be going back on to Medicaid just like they were last year. We'
p566
aS'have 2.2 million people on the exchanges, but five million people had their policies'
p567
aS"cancelled. No one, I think, predicted that at this point this late in the game you wouldn't"
p568
aS"even know whether we've increased the insurance numbers and the administration"
p569
aS'refuses to certify that that is actually happening. Meanwhile, we were not supposed to'
p570
aS'hurt anyone who had insurance, right? If you liked your plan and you liked your doctor,'
p571
aS'you could keep them. We all know that that has not happened, so five million people'
p572
aS'have had their plans cancelled, and many people who are buying new plans are seeing'
p573
aS'that their doctors are not -- the best hospitals and doctors in their area have been'
p574
aS'kicked off the network in order to keep the premium costs down on the exchanges. So,'
p575
aS'it was also supposed to be really popular, , right? Because we had all of this great stuff,'
p576
aS"this giant Rube Goldberg apparatus layered on top. We didn't take anything away, we"
p577
aS'only gave.'
p578
aS"And it's kind of time for a Dr. Phil moment, how is that working for you? Nothing is"
p579
aS'working the way the administration said. So you can say it does not really matter'
p580
aS'whether it is unpopular, right? The point is not to be popular, and yes, some people'
p581
aS"have gotten hurt, but you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, right? It was"
p582
aS'never reasonable to think that everyone was going to get to keep the doctors and the'
p583
aS'plans that they wanted. Something had to change and this is a foundation for'
p584
aS'something better. But this foundation has so many cracks you cannot build a healthy'
p585
aS'structure on top of it. Just look at everything the administration has had to do in the'
p586
aS'last few months just to keep the law running. They had to delay the employer mandate'
p587
aS'and the enforcement, apparently because they couldnt even figure out how to make'
p588
aS"this regulation work. It may never go into effect, which means we'll lose millions of"
p589
aS'people who were supposed to get coverage expanded through and the'
p590
aS'cost will go up to the government. They delayed the Spanish language website, and'
p591
aS'now apparently part of it is written in Spanglish. Despite the fact that Hispanics are a'
p592
aS'major constituency for insurance expansion. They delayed the small business'
p593
aS'exchanges.'
p594
aS"They've allowed people to keep plans that were supposed to be illegal because they"
p595
aS"weren't real insurance Kathleen Sebelius told us. They've delayed deadlines over and"
p596
aS"over again. They've done all these things by asserting emergency powers by doing"
p597
aS'administrative fixes through executive fiat, and yeah fair enough, Obamacare is certainly'
p598
aS'an emergency, but all of these changes have had the effect of undermining and'
p599
aS'destabilizing the law that they think is so important. Theyve had to do these things'
p600
aS'even though they know it makes the insurance pools less actuarily sound, because they'
p601
aS"can't face the political backlash. And what happens when Republicans get into office"
p602
aS'and I assume they, too, think Obamacare is an emergency and could be fixed with some'
p603
aS"executive orders. Essentially they've made it so that Republicans can undo two-thirds of"
p604
aS'this law with a stroke of the presidential pen. Obamacare is Now Beyond Rescue. The'
p605
aS'administration has destroyed their own law in order to save it. Thank you.'

aS'the end it worked, and the reason it worked is because we know how to renovate'

p639
aS'in the law, they had to delay this, they had to fix this, the Spanish language website'
p640
aS"didn't work as well as they wanted the first day. You have to ask, are these things that"

p642
aS"a renovation? They said, oh, we didn't quite get the counters we want. Oh, this went a"
p643
aS'little bit over cost. Well, then you have to ask -- to answer that question you have to ask'
p644
aS'what kind of endeavor is Obamacare?'
p645
aS'Is the Obama administration trying to build a moon base? Is the Obama administration'
p646
aS'trying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile Muslim country? No. What'
p647
aS"they're trying to do is build a national health insurance plan. Can you build a national"
p648
aS'health insurance plan? Well, every advanced economy in the world, except the United'
p649
aS'States, has built a national health insurance plan. All of those countries insure all their'
p650
aS'citizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the United States. So'
p651
aS'youre a priori assumption has to be yeah, this is something you can basically do that the'
p652
aS'problems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself, but the'
p653
aS'problems you have any time you go through any major project. So, what our opponents'
p654
aS'have been trying to do for months, and months, and months, actually is paint this'
p655
aS'picture where every time the contractor comes to you and says, "Oh, it turns out they'
p656
aS'don\'t have this color, oh, it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day," it means'
p657
aS'the whole thing is going to collapse on its own.'
p658
aS'But actually, nothing like that is happening at all. And there is no evidence that anything'
p659
aS'like this is happening. The main argument that the opponents have been making the'
p660
aS"entire time is that there is going to be a death spiral. That's the only plausible"
p661
aS'mechanism that they have, that the law will fail. A death spiral is a term that I expected'
p662
aS"them to talk about, because that's what they've been talking about for months. It's"
p663
aS"something they've barely invoked at all. And I think the reason is it's become clear, in"
p664
aS"recent days, that there's no chance of a death spiral in the Obamacare law. A death"
p665
aS'spiral is when you have too many old, sick people who drive up the cost, making the'
p666
aS'premiums more expensive, leading the healthy people to flee, driving up costs more.'
p667
aS'That is theoretically possible, but is not something that can possibly happen in this law.'
p668
aS'In fact, if you want to say, "Is the law succeeding?" you don\'t have to ask the'
p669
aS'administration. You could ask the insurers, right? Because the insurers have recently'
p670
aS"been saying they're very happy with the mix of people -- the mix of people you have in"
p671
aS"the exchanges is sound. It's sustainable. They don't need -- they don't need it to"
p672
aS'change.'
p673
aS"They've got a mix of people that's healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward."
p674
aS"What's more, even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than they"
p675
aS'expect, you had -- the Kaiser Health Foundation ran the numbers and said, "What\'s the'
p676
aS'worst-case scenario?" We don\'t get any increase in young people at all. And they said it'
p677
aS'would be about a 2.4 percent increase in premiums 2.4 percent increase in health'
p678
aS'insurance premiums. If any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a 2.4'
p679
aS'percent increase over your bill last year, you\'d say, "Thank God it\'s only a 2.4 percent'
p680
aS'increase," right? That\'s a rounding error. No one notices 2.4 percent. That couldn\'t'
p681
aS"possibly set off a death spiral. So there's really no plausible mechanism that the law"
p682
aS"could fail. So I think what they're giving you -- instead of what used to be the plausible"
p683
aS"mechanism for which the -- this can fail, they're giving you a mix of wishes and hopes"
p684
aS'and completely debunked facts. They said, "Cost growth leveled after 2010. No. Cost'
p685
aS'growth in 2012 was lower than at any year in 50 years. And in fact -- this is important'
p686
aS'because when the law was passed, cost growth was the main thing they talked about.'
p687
aS'Obamacare was supposed to control costs. And they said, "No, no, it\'s going to make'
p688
aS"costs explode with all this bureaucracy regulation. They're going to go out of control."
p689
aS'What happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimistic'
p690
aS"estimates believed it would be before the law was signed. And so now, they're reduced"
p691
aS'-- instead of saying, "This disaster of cost growth is going to happen," they\'re going to'
p692
aS'say, "This incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence. So, all they\'re'
p693
aS"saying is essentially that this wonderful thing that's happened has nothing to do with"
p694
aS'the gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to the'
p695
aS"lowest level in 50 years. And you can't prove that it's not a coincidence. But you have"
p696
aS"to -- see, this is indicative of the mentality we're dealing with, where it simply moves"
p697
aS'from one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario.'
p698
aS'So you have to wonder, "Why are they simple moving from one disaster scenario to'
p699
aS'another disaster scenario?"'
p700
aS'Actually, I wanted to debunk a couple points they made, because a lot of this is just --'
p701
aS"we've heard from the other side -- are not true. I can't give you links and charts to"
p702
aS"debunk them, but let me say that it's not the case that 5 million policies have been"
p703
aS"canceled. That's a number that was floating about that you can't verify. It's almost"
p704
aS'certainly not true. Many journalists have tried to figure out exactly how many policies'
p705
aS"have been canceled. And they don't have good enough records to know, but they know"
p706
aS"it's not 5 million. And they suspect -- the administration suspects it's closer to one-tenth"
p707
aS"of that figure. They can't actually prove that either, but for various reasons, you don't"
p708
aS"have a good enough count. This -- that's almost certainly nowhere close to 5 million."
p709
aS"And that's a big number that's -- they're citing because they're saying, that -- those are"
p710
aS"the losers. But it's really nowhere close to that. Yet they say -- Megan said we can't --"
p711
aS"we can't say for sure how many -- how -- that there are more insured now than there"
p712
aS"were before. We can't say for sure, because again, this number can't exactly be"
p713
aS"counted. We don't know that 400,000 -- it was 500,000. But we know it's not anywhere"
p714
aS"close to 5 million. And it's a mortal certainty that far more people have health"
p715
aS'insurance now than would have had in absence of the law.'
p716
aS'So why are we having this kind of lurch, from one argument, abandoning these'
p717
aS'arguments when they disappear, and simply coming up with new ones? The truth is,'
p718
aS'they disagree with the goals of the law. And I think you could hear that in their remarks.'
p719
aS'They say, "There\'s less choice. And it\'s true. The government says insurers have to'
p720
aS"provide certain benefits right. They have to provide pregnancy coverage. That's -- and"
p721
aS'maternity care. Those are the most controversial things that are mostly cited, because'
p722
aS'they want people who are male or old to not have to pay for those things. And they'
p723
aS'want people who are young and female and might have to bear children to pay those'
p724
aS"costs themselves, because that's an ideological difference between the two sides. And"
p725
aS"that's fine for them to have an ideological difference between the two sides. But we're"
p726
aS"not here to debate whether this law is a good idea. We're here to debate whether the"
p727
aS"law is actually working, and the truth is the only reason they're desperately trying to"
p728
aS'claim the law is not working is because they oppose national health insurance.'

p755
aS'So on into round two, and round two, as I said, is where the debaters address each'
p756
aS'other directly. The motion is "Obamacare is now beyond rescue." We have two teams'
p757
aS'arguing for and against that. The team arguing for the motion, Scott Gottlieb and'
p758
aS'Megan McArdle, have argued -- in a sense, they are arguing that the law from its'
p759
aS'beginnings has always been beyond rescue, that it reduces competition, it reduces'
p760
aS'choice, it pushes people into Medicaid, a system which does not have good medical'
p761
aS'outcomes, or at least not the kind of medical outcomes that people would aspire to for'
p762
aS"it. And they've described the law as a Rube Goldberg kind of apparatus and that the"
p763
aS'administration only gets away with calling it "successful" in any way by continuously'
p764
aS'moving the goalposts. Team arguing against the motion, Dr. Douglas Kamerow and'
p765
aS'Jonathan Chait, say, "Yeah, the law is not perfect," but they\'re arguing that it\'s working'
p766
aS'in real ways already, that there are more people insured now than there were three'
p767
aS'years ago in the United States, that standards are being forced, and that -- in general,'
p768
aS"that we've come a long way."
p769
aS'And they also argue that the terms of the basic law, the aspirations of the law, that lots'
p770
aS'of countries do it, and that, in fact, it does work. They argue that the opposition from'
p771
aS"their opponents is more ideological, that they just don't actually want the law to"
p772
aS"succeed, a question I'd actually like to put to the side arguing for the motion. Is that the"
p773
aS'case? Would you -- in an ideal world, would Obamacare succeed or would you hate'
p774
aS'that? Scott Gottlieb.'

p2386
aS"know when it would be fixed. We didn't know if it would be fixed. Some people"

p2391
aS'And I think if you look back into the history of libertarian anti-statism in America,'
p2392
aS"there's a long tradition of these kinds of fear mongering predictions, senators who were"
p2393
aS'opposed to child labor laws a few years ago saying that children would refuse to do'
p2394
aS'chores in their household, Ronald Reagan saying, "If we pass Medicare the government'

p2401
aS"day we're going to look back at the kinds of predictions they've been making about"
p2402
aS"Obamacare, and those will go in the time capsule, and they'll look just as silly as the"

p2442
aS'lot of benefits managers are saying basically everyone is going to have to go to light'
