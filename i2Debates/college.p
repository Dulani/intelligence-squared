S"Thank you, and welcome. We're so pleased to be here in Chicago and proud to be a"
p34
aS'partner with the first Chicago Ideas Week. My role in these proceedings is to frame the'
p35
aS"debate, to outline the reasons we felt it was worth having. Tonight's motion is so"
p36
aS'counterintuitive one might wonder why we chose it as a topic. After all, there seems to'
p37
aS'be ample statistical support for the value of a college education. College graduates earn'
p38
aS'about $20,000 a year more than high school graduates, nearly half a million dollars over'
p39
aS'their lifetimes. Some 9.7 percent of high school graduates are currently unemployed'
p40
aS'compared with 4.2 percent of college graduates.'
p41
aS'So going to high school and not college doubles your chance of being unemployed. In a'
p42
aS'rapidly changing global economy, many of the traditionally high-paid jobs in'
p43
aS'manufacturing that high school graduates could get are gone forever. And employers'
p44
aS'are looking for the kind of cognitive skills that we normally associate with college'
p45
aS'graduates. And turning from material considerations, a liberal arts education is likely to'
p46
aS'produce a superior electorate, a more vital civil society, a citizenry with better'
p47
aS'understanding of American ideals and better ability to adapt to changing circumstances.'
p48
aS'And on a more personal level, a Chicago reporter asked me how I, transcending an'
p49
aS'obscure family background through scholarships to Yale and Harvard Law School, could'
p50
aS"possibly entertain tonight's motion."
p51
aS'So what is the counter argument? It is that only a small percentage of high school'
p52
aS'graduates actually have the aptitudes to do well with colleges of reasonable quality.'
p53
aS'The majority of those enrolling in college lack the basic skills and aptitudes to take'
p54
aS'pleasure in the experience or otherwise to succeed. For such students, college becomes'
p55
aS'an extended adolescence and at best a remediation for inadequate high schools. But'
p56
aS'not a grounding of the essentials of cultural intelligence and such basic skills as'
p57
aS'expository writing or quantitative reasoning or scientific method or primary research.'
p58
aS'Might not such students get more from vocationally oriented education of the sort they'
p59
aS'would likely receive in such successful economies as Germany and Switzerland?'
p60
aS'In those countries, by the way, only about 20 percent or so complete four-year degree'
p61
aS'programs compared with double that figure in the U.S. And for the students at the very'
p62
aS'top of the scale, at the most elite colleges, might college prove an impediment to'
p63
aS'creative thinking or a distraction from their entrepreneurial drive? What lessons might'
p64
aS'we take from the extraordinary contributions of such college dropouts as Bill Gates,'
p65
aS'Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs? Well, your role tonight is to listen to the'
p66
aS'arguments, to question the panelists and ultimately to decide which side was more'
p67
aS'persuasive. Whatever you decide, I hope you will come away with the sense that on this'
p68
aS'issue, like so many others that seem at first blush to be one-sided, that there is an'
p69
aS'intellectually respectable position on both sides of the debate. And with that hope, I'
p70
aS'turn the evening over to our moderator John Donvan and this extraordinary panel of'
p71
aS'experts gathered for our first live debate in Chicago.'

p94
aS"verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S. I'm John Donvan from ABC News. We are at"
p95
aS'Venue Six10 at the Spertus Center in Chicago. Too many kids go to college. Two teams'
p96
aS'will argue that proposition from opposite sides, for it and against it. All of our debaters'
p97
aS'come to this from different perspectives, all of them are trying to win you over because'
p98
aS"you, our live audience, will act as the judges. And only one side will win. So let's meet"
p99
aS'our panelist of debaters. The motion being, "Too many kids go to college." The team'
p100
aS'arguing for the motion include tech entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist, Paypal'
p101
aS'cofounder, Peter Thiel.'
p102
aS'His teammate is a political scientist who sees the Bachelor of Arts degree as a source of'
p103
aS'class division. American Enterprise Institute scholar, Charles Murray. Opposing them at'
p104
aS"the facing table and arguing that it's not true that too many kids go to college, one of"
p105
aS"Northwestern University's most transformative leaders, president emeritus, Henry"
p106
aS'Bienen.'
p107
aS'And joining him, an entrepreneur turned academic, he is also a columnist for the'
p108
aS'Washington Post, Vivek Wadhwa.'
p109
aS"So this is a contest. It's a debate. One side will win, and one side will lose. And you, our"
p110
aS'live audience, will hear them debate for three rounds, and then you will choose the'
p111
aS'winner by voting once before the debate and once again after the debate.'
p112
aS"So let's go to the first debate now. If you go to the key pads on your seats, only pay"
p113
aS"attention because on the right hand side is the one that's relevant to you. Pay attention"
p114
aS'only to keys number one, two and three. The others are irrelevant. If you agree with'
p115
aS'the motion that too many kids go to college, if, at this point, you agree with the side --'
p116
aS"this side that's arguing that point of view, push number one. And if you disagree with"
p117
aS"this side, push number two. And if you're undecided, push number three. And if you"
p118
aS'think you made a mistake, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote. So'
p119
aS'remember, we have three rounds of debate. After the third round of debate, we ask'
p120
aS'you to vote again, to tell us who you think presented the best argument. And the team'
p121
aS'that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner. So on to round one,'
p122
aS'opening statements by each debater in turn.'
p123
aS'They are seven minutes each. These statements are uninterrupted. Our motion is "Too'

S'Thank you. Let me actually just start with that question. You know, I went to Stanford'
p174
aS"undergrad, Stanford law school. Throughout the '90s, I had a belief that education was"
p175
aS'absolutely paramount. We should only hire people that went to the best schools. And -'
p176
aS'- and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal. And I use this -'
p177
aS'- and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society. And over'
p178
aS"the last four or five years, I've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of"
p179
aS'different reasons. The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley, that I saw so many'
p180
aS'very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done'
p181
aS'extraordinary well. In some ways, they were also more creative.'
p182
aS'They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing'
p183
aS'people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive but'
p184
aS'more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that'
p185
aS'were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more'
p186
aS'entrepreneurial side. And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years'
p187
aS'because unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously.'
p188
aS'The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously. And so'
p189
aS'the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago. College costs in'
p190
aS'nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980. Even after'
p191
aS"inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent. Costs about four times as much. Inflation"
p192
aS"adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything"
p193
aS'else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a'
p194
aS'number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and'
p195
aS'escalation.'
p196
aS"And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I've"
p197
aS"come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people"
p198
aS'who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked'
p199
aS'career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing'
p200
aS'something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we'
p201
aS"had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles"
p202
aS'is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying'
p203
aS"more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech"
p204
aS"stocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30"
p205
aS"years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible"
p206
aS'psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it.'
p207
aS"And in '99 in Silicon Valley you couldn't question the NASDAQ valuations, and in 2005"
p208
aS'you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in'
p209
aS'the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society. And to'
p210
aS'question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three-'
p211
aS"year-old kids or something like that. And while we're not trying to scare the children"
p212
aS'here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in'
p213
aS'this country. We had two already. They were catastrophically bad. They led to'
p214
aS'enormous misallocation of resources. And when we look at education more carefully'
p215
aS'there are a lot of worrisome signs. Student debts at this point total over a trillion'
p216
aS'dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they'
p217
aS"are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the"
p218
aS'outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000.'
p219
aS"And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000"
p220
aS'people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobs'
p221
aS"available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're"
p222
aS'producing way more for a society that probably already has too many. The median'
p223
aS"wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on"
p224
aS'another quarter million in law school debt typically. Pre-med, only about nine percent'
p225
aS'of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school. The'
p226
aS'other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their'
p227
aS'freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of'
p228
aS'post college to figure that sort of stuff out. If you broaden the ambit more generally,'
p229
aS"there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and"
p230
aS"are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's"
p231
aS'something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work.'
p232
aS'And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can'
p233
aS'also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we'
p234
aS'have as a society. We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create'
p235
aS"more good paying jobs. We don't have enough of either in our society. And while"
p236
aS"education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing. And we want to question this"
p237
aS'notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity. And in fact when'
p238
aS'people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you'
p239
aS'start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic'
p240
aS"approximations that abound. And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit."
p241
aS"Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for. We're not saying that nobody should"
p242
aS"go to college. We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing."
p243
aS"We're not saying everybody should drop out. We're simply saying that too many people"
p244
aS'are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech'
p245
aS"companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech"
p246
aS"companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we"
p247
aS"shouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice. And what we"
p248
aS'are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would'
p249
aS'encourage all of you to think more about your future. Do not think of education as'
p250
aS"something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself."
p251
aS'If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go to'
p252
aS"college even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead"
p253
aS"I'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the"
p254
aS'problems. But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that'
p255
aS'this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, I'
p256
aS'would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school'
p257
aS'and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default'
p258
aS'answer for everything.'
p259
aS'The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an'
p260
aS'absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake? And if these'
p261
aS'people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to'
p262
aS'get a refund?'

p318
aS'Because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is'
p319
aS'fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create. I care deeply about this'
p320
aS'issue. Im an educator, 28 years at Princeton, 14.5 years as Northwesterns president,'

p322
aS'Board of Education, appointed by the mayor for the Chicago Public School System. Sure,'
p323
aS'some dropouts make it big.'
p324
aS'But social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis, not anecdotal'
p325
aS'individual life histories, no matter how compelling. Most people are not Bill Gates or'
p326
aS'Steve Jobs. We should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in'
p327
aS'time as an indication of likely long outcomes. As Damon Runyon once said, The race is'
p328
aS'not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but thats how the smart money'
p329
aS'bets. The argument that too many people are going to college is not new. In his youth,'
p330
aS'Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, argued this in The Overeducated American in'
p331
aS'1976. He was wrong then, and our opponents are wrong now. And by the way, hes'
p332
aS'changed his mind. We now have studies and lots of information. Mr. Rosenkranz'
p333
aS'alluded to some of them, which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more'
p334
aS'years of school, post-secondary, are positively correlated with earning over ones'
p335
aS'lifetime, and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration'
p336
aS'being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained.'
p337
aS'4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed. More than triple that number of high'
p338
aS'school students or high school dropouts are unemployed. This is very compelling.'
p339
aS'Theres a clear wage premium to education. Theres also a social premium to society,'
p340
aS'not just individual. Society benefits through greater productivity, lower crime, better'
p341
aS'health, better citizenship for more educated people. And the wage premium to'
p342
aS'education has been growing since the 1980s, not shrinking. The question to be decided'
p343
aS'is whether its true that too many kids go to college. Fact: In 2010, about 66 percent of'
p344
aS'the United States population between 25 and 30 had some college experience. The rest'
p345
aS'were high school grads or high school dropouts. Its hardly the case that everyone or'
p346
aS'too many are pouring into college.'
p347
aS'We need more, not fewer, college graduates. Going to college in the United States, by'
p348
aS'the way, means very different things. From two-year community colleges, flagship'
p349
aS'public research universities, small denominational colleges, elite privates, and for-'
p350
aS'profits. By the way, at the for-profits, the average age of the students is 28, and these'
p351
aS'are not kids. Many of them are single mothers. Many are minorities. They dont'
p352
aS'choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great'
p353
aS'athletic teams or a climbing wall. They come to improve their careers, their income,'
p354
aS'their life chances, and they do. In his articles, Mr. Murray argues that too many people'
p355
aS'are going to college, and I feel he believes in innate qualities. He uses a language like,'
p356
aS'He does not have it in him. But how does he know this? What measures does he'
p357
aS'have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact? He believes, I'
p358
aS'think, that abilities are fixed.'
p359
aS'Its a highly stratified view of the world and peoples places in it, and I dont share it.'
p360
aS'True, plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready. We know this in'
p361
aS'Chicago. But low college graduation rates and dropout cannot be attributed'
p362
aS"everywhere and completely to individual's intelligence or competence. Even some"
p363
aS'qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight'
p364
aS'years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out. No'
p365
aS"doubt, some people don't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed. But for"
p366
aS'many, their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not'
p367
aS'preparing them. We should not be so ready to consign them to what Mr. Murray may'
p368
aS'feel is their fate. Neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what,'
p369
aS'for many will be low-level jobs. Because for every college degree holder who is a janitor'
p370
aS'or a waitress, there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school'
p371
aS'dropouts.'
p372
aS'Mr. Thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college'
p373
aS'attendance and higher income. But he doubts the direction of causation. That is,'
p374
aS'college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it. In my view,'
p375
aS'whatever the direction of causation, you can learn skills at college and improve your life'
p376
aS'chances. And by the way, we have lots of studies, including studies of twins that Allen'
p377
aS'Kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself'
p378
aS'among all the other variables which count. And college does make a difference. Now,'
p379
aS"high school vocational alternatives are there, but they're not widely regarded as --"
p380
aS"they're widely regarded as second best by the general public. Polls show that most"
p381
aS'Americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college. They support'
p382
aS"alternatives for other people's children. I wonder if those in favor of the proposition"
p383
aS'want their own children or relatives to not go to college.'
p384
aS'Mr. Thiel, Mr. Murray, I know Mr. Thiel has started this fund, and I applaud his'
p385
aS'generosity. It is very generous. Will he fund tens of thousands, millions? All the trend'
p386
aS'lines show a shift in the U.S. economy and its labor force towards more people requiring'
p387
aS'post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education.'
p388
aS"We've hollowed out industrial jobs. The clear way to premium for college graduates is"
p389
aS'growing. It skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. Advanced degree holders did vastly'
p390
aS'better, and their advantage continues to hold up. And by the way, for women, that'
p391
aS'wage premium is even higher than for men. I need to conclude, but I want to conclude'
p392
aS"by saying there are not many alternatives in the U.S. We don't have a vocational system"
p393
aS"like Switzerland or Germany. I'm not against building such a vocational system. I'd like"
p394
aS'to see more tracks that people can go to. But what we really need to do is do better in'
p395
aS'pre-K through 12.'
p396
aS'We cannot accept that too many kids go to college. In summary, those who go beyond'
p397
aS"secondary school are -- not all kids. There are not too many of them. I'm not willing to"
p398
aS"consign them to low-level jobs. We need to do better, and we can't give up on the"
p399
aS'American dream. Thank you.'

S'I think we better get the topic straight. When I agreed to debate on too many kids are'
p461
aS'going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA. I'
p462
aS"didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest."
p463
aS"Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that"
p464
aS"too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't"
p465
aS'have accepted the position on the affirmative. Almost everybody needs more education'
p466
aS"after high school. What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive,"
p467
aS'antediluvian thing called a BA. The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the'
p468
aS'work of the devil.'
p469
aS"Let's go through each of those accusations. First, fraudulent. The BA is supposed to"
p470
aS'signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated'
p471
aS"person. You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more. The number of"
p472
aS"colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not --"
p473
aS"don't exist. But it's much worse than that."
p474
aS"If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know"
p475
aS'anything. If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in'
p476
aS'introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get'
p477
aS'a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam'
p478
aS'scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what?'
p479
aS"They're transmuted into Bs. And why are they transmuted into Bs? Because the story"
p480
aS'they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much'
p481
aS"tuition money as you can. And you've got to retain kids. And in fact, if they want to drop"
p482
aS"out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the"
p483
aS'college. You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about'
p484
aS"applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications"
p485
aS"and sometimes can't read very well."
p486
aS'All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills. I am talking'
p487
aS'about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems.'
p488
aS"And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system"
p489
aS'and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges. Knowing what major a person had'
p490
aS"doesn't tell you very much. Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering,"
p491
aS'okay. But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person'
p492
aS"who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought"
p493
aS"to hire me. It doesn't really mean anything. Now, here is what you do know about a"
p494
aS'person with a BA if you know what school they came from. So if the applicant came'
p495
aS'from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he'
p496
aS'went to college.'
p497
aS'You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record'
p498
aS"or he wouldn't have gotten in. You don't know anything about what Harvard has added."
p499
aS'And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a'
p500
aS'whole bunch of ways. None of this should be news to any of you. The retreat of the'
p501
aS"academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education."
p502
aS'Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just'
p503
aS"12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless. Okay,"
p504
aS'destructive. Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains'
p505
aS"true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one. And the"
p506
aS"problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got"
p507
aS'about 32 percent of adults that have a BA. The employers know how clueless many of'
p508
aS'them are. Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of'
p509
aS'population in terms of their ability.'
p510
aS"So they're being rational. But the problem is this: We have created a kind of self-"
p511
aS'fulfilling prophecy. We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in'
p512
aS'the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy. And so a lot of'
p513
aS'ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and'
p514
aS'accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper. It is'
p515
aS'not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal'
p516
aS'articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes'
p517
aS"and don't study. They aren't there to get an education. They're there to get a piece of"
p518
aS'paper. It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential. It is'
p519
aS"destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they"
p520
aS'know college is not for them.'
p521
aS'It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish. But'
p522
aS"most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture. We have always prided ourselves"
p523
aS'upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human'
p524
aS'dignity. We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that'
p525
aS'says otherwise. Antediluvian. I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have'
p526
aS'a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete. Four'
p527
aS"years is almost always too long. There's hardly any profession that requires four years"
p528
aS'of class work. A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that. The'
p529
aS"rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing. What's the"
p530
aS'rationale for having a library these days? It used to be central.'
p531
aS"Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any"
p532
aS'individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving'
p533
aS"that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to"
p534
aS"millions? Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before. The"
p535
aS'information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an'
p536
aS"education. Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming"
p537
aS'down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined. What we need is'
p538
aS'a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter'
p539
aS'to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where'
p540
aS'they learned it and how long it took them. Thank you.'

aS'I have a totally different perspective on this whole debate. In fact, when I first stepped'
p610
aS"into it, it was ripping Peter Thiel's head off in an article I wrote for telling kids to drop"
p611
aS"out of college because it didn't make sense to me. You know, as an academic for the"
p612
aS"last six or seven years I've been researching what's happening globally. I've been"
p613
aS'researching the impact of globalization on U.S. competitiveness.'
p614
aS"I've been researching American schools versus other schools, and so on, and what"
p615
aS"makes America what it is, our competitiveness, immigration, those topics I've been"
p616
aS'researching. And when I step back from that, my conclusion is that these people in'
p617
aS"America are totally completely out of touch. If you read my writings, you'll see that I've"
p618
aS'been writing very controversial articles, each of them rip into a different aspect of'
p619
aS"American competitiveness because we don't get it. We're sitting here in our own little"
p620
aS"bubble disconnected from the rest of the world. Now, let -- I'm going to give you three"
p621
aS'perspectives on this. First of all, about U.S. education itself, believe it or not, U.S.'
p622
aS'education is by far the best in the world. Everyone is trying to be like us. People from'
p623
aS'abroad stake their life savings, all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in'
p624
aS"sending their kids to America because we've got the best schools. What do they gain"
p625
aS"from our schools? It's not the courses. It's really the knowledge. It's how to learn. You"
p626
aS'gain social skills. You learn how to interact with other people.'
p627
aS'You learn how to deal with failure, make compromises. You learn how to solve'
p628
aS'problems. These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making'
p629
aS'you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out the'
p630
aS'best and the brightest in the world. This is why America is what it is. Now, another'
p631
aS"argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college. Charles has"
p632
aS"written a lot about IQ, IQ tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life."
p633
aS"To me that's complete baloney. My whole life I've faced stereotypes because I happen"
p634
aS'to be a race that may not be very smart. In my youth my people were beggars and'
p635
aS"snake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot CEOs."
p636
aS"In my lifetime I've seen the transformation of how people perceive me. So if I was going"
p637
aS"by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my people"
p638
aS"shouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to be"
p639
aS'successful, therefore, leave us out.'
p640
aS"You'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America. We don't know. I tell"
p641
aS"you if -- I know from my own children that they've gone through gyrations, so trying to"
p642
aS'decide what they want to be when they grow up. When they were young, they had'
p643
aS'some ideas. Now, if I had to decide when my sons were 16 years old, whether they'
p644
aS'would go to school or not based on their aptitude, it would be the worst decision I could'
p645
aS'possibly ever make because Id be wrong. Both of them decided to do completely'
p646
aS'different things than what they were talking about when they were young. Children'
p647
aS'dont know. So who are we? Who are parents to try to figure out whether they should'
p648
aS'get education or not? America is what it is because of our education system. America'
p649
aS'started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. We became the most fiercely'
p650
aS'competitive land in the world because we educated everyone. Now there are a lot of'
p651
aS'people left out as Henry talked about, but the solution to fixing Americas'
p652
aS'competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone. Now we can debate what'
p653
aS'a college is. To me, a community college is a college.'
p654
aS'A college -- you know, Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley'
p655
aS'where everyone thinks -- when they think college, they think Stanford. They think'
p656
aS'Berkeley maybe, so, one level below Stanford, but thats it. And when he talks and'
p657
aS'when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt,'
p658
aS'$250,000 of debt. I know some great people who have gone to community colleges'
p659
aS'who have almost no debt, who worked part time, been able to pay their fees off. Our'
p660
aS'community colleges in this country are also colleges, and they too are better than the'
p661
aS'best -- they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the'
p662
aS'world. I dont know why we keep forgetting that. Now, I also taught, you know, I teach'
p663
aS'at several universities. I was at University, and my students brought up'
p664
aS'Peter Thiel. Hes quite a legend worldwide now. They were talking -- they said,'
p665
aS'Professor, is there really an American investor whos paying children to drop out of'
p666
aS'college? I mean, they were so confused. At the end of it, we talked about it, and they'
p667
aS'said, You know, this is great because were going to eat their lunch.'
p668
aS'This is what they were thinking. They didnt say it. But this is whats happening in the'
p669
aS'world right now. Just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children, the'
p670
aS'rest of the world has learned our trick. India and China are now graduating 1.5 million'
p671
aS'engineers a year. Theyre educating all their people because they know that its going to'
p672

aS'of school and be very successful. Fine. Therere 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in'
p677
aS'America who dont need to go to college. I have researched this systematically. What'
p678
aS'we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the'
p679
aS'same world that Peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a'
p680
aS'Bachelors degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in'
p681
aS'terms of revenue and number of employees.'
p682
aS'In terms of success, thats how much difference education makes. Now, the interesting'
p683
aS'thing is what we also learned was that it doesnt matter what school you graduate from.'
p684
aS'The tech founders in America, the most successful people in America graduated from a'
p685
aS'wide assortment of universities. There are almost as many universities as there were'
p686
aS'entrepreneurs in the research we did. It didnt matter whether you graduated from a'
p687
aS'community college or whether you graduated from Harvard. You could still make it big'
p688
aS'as an entrepreneur. Why? Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to'
p689
aS'learn. Now, moving forward, the Indians and Chinese are going to be eating our'
p690

aS'of the students who are pursuing BAs, they are pursuing what has been described as a'

aS'Wadhwa are arguing that, number one, going to college is part of the American dream,'
p732
aS'that those who go to college do better financially and otherwise than those who do not.'

aS'how many people went to college in the U.S. in the 19th or early 20th century, it was a'
p752
aS'very, very small percentage. And it was -- this is a very recent phenomenon that this is'
p753
aS'seen as an absolute necessity. And I think in many ways I would actually flip it around,'
p754
aS"and I would say, what's gone wrong with the American dream that we have to have"

aS"people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past. People don't need"

aS"you don't need them, many bad jobs. People get stuck with college degrees. But I'd"

aS"investment in your future? I don't think it's a good investment because it's costing too"

aS"they're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they're going to be debt slaves for"

aS'the rest of their lives or for the next 10, 20 years. And so I think the way to think of it is'
p767
