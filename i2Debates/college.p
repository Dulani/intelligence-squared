p231
aS'You know, I went to Stanfordundergrad, Stanford law school.'
p232
aS"Throughout the '90s, I had a belief that education wasabsolutely paramount."
p233
aS'We should only hire people that went to the best schools.'
p234
aS'And -- and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal.'
p235
aS'And I use this -- and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society.'
p236
aS"And overthe last four or five years, I've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number ofdifferent reasons."
p237
aS'The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley, that I saw so manyvery talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still doneextraordinary well.'
p238
aS'In some ways, they were also more creative.They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcingpeople to take better paying jobs that were more munitive butmore boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, thatwere discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the moreentrepreneurial side.'
p239
aS'And this has become a more and more acute issue over the yearsbecause unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously.The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously.'
p240
aS'And sothe choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago.'
p241
aS'College costs innominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980.'
p242
aS"Even afterinflation, it's gone up by 300 percent."
p243
aS'Costs about four times as much.'
p244
aS"Inflationadjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anythingelse in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of anumber of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation andescalation.And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I'vecome to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented peoplewho are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow trackedcareer, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencingsomething of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles wehad in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubblesis characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are payingmore and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was techstocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incrediblepsychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it.And in '99 in Silicon Valley you couldn't question the NASDAQ valuations, and in 2005you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and inthe same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society."
p245
aS'And toquestion the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three-year-old kids or something like that.'
p246
aS"And while we're not trying to scare the childrenhere or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble inthis country."
p247
aS'We had two already.'
p248
aS'They were catastrophically bad.'
p249
aS'They led toenormous misallocation of resources.'
p250
aS'And when we look at education more carefullythere are a lot of worrisome signs.'
p251
aS"Student debts at this point total over a trilliondollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, theyare still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but theoutperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000.And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobsavailable in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we'reproducing way more for a society that probably already has too many."
p252
aS"The medianwage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken onanother quarter million in law school debt typically."
p253
aS'Pre-med, only about nine percentof the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school.'
p254
aS'Theother 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that theirfreshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years ofpost college to figure that sort of stuff out.'
p255
aS"If you broaden the ambit more generally,there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees andare basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there'ssomething like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work.And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it canalso be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems wehave as a society."
p256
aS'We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we createmore good paying jobs.'
p257
aS"We don't have enough of either in our society."
p258
aS"And whileeducation is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing."
p259
aS'And we want to question thisnotion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity.'
p260
aS'And in fact whenpeople say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, youstart ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophicapproximations that abound.'
p261
aS"And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit.Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for."
p262
aS"We're not saying that nobody shouldgo to college."
p263
aS"We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing.We're not saying everybody should drop out."
p264
aS"We're simply saying that too many peopleare going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many techcompanies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no techcompanies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but weshouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice."
p265
aS'And what weare hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that wouldencourage all of you to think more about your future.'
p266
aS"Do not think of education assomething that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself.If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go tocollege even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do insteadI'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all theproblems."
p267
aS'But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer thatthis was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, Iwould have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high schooland a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic defaultanswer for everything.The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is anabsolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake?'

aS'They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive but more boring, and track them into things that were not as interesting or important, that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side.'
p285
aS'And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when I went to college, the cost has gone up tremendously.'
p286
aS'The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously.'
p287
aS'And so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago.'
p288
aS'College costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980.'
p289
aS"Even after inflation, it's gone up by 300 percent."
p290
aS'Costs about four times as much.'
p291
aS"Inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago, it's gone up more than anything else in our society, more than health care, more than housing, more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation."
p292
aS"And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I've come to believe that the problem is much broader, it's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career, but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education, a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s, and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things, number one, runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality hasn't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech stocks, in the 2000s it was housing -- education, I'm not saying it's worse than it was 30 years ago but I don't think it's gotten much better, and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you cannot question it."
p293
aS"And in '99 in Silicon Valley you couldn't question the NASDAQ valuations, and in 2005 you could not question people buying houses, it was strictly taboo and forbidden, and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society."
p294
aS'And to question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three- year-old kids or something like that.'
p295
aS"And while we're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that, we do think that we cannot afford to have a third bubble in this country."
p296
aS'We had two already.'
p297
aS'They were catastrophically bad.'
p298
aS'They led to enormous misallocation of resources.'
p299
aS'And when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs.'
p300
aS"Student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars, and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college, they are still doing pretty well, they're still doing better than they used to, but the outperformance has been going down, and going down since about 2000."
p301
aS"And, you know, the law school context I'm quite familiar with, there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S., there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is, but we're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many."
p302
aS"The median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which isn't that great considering that you've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically."
p303
aS'Pre-med, only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school.'
p304
aS'The other 91 percent are wasting their time, and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out.'
p305
aS"If you broaden the ambit more generally, there's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics, there's something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work."
p306
aS'And so when we say that education is important and paramount, that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society.'
p307
aS'We need to figure out how do we create more jobs, how do we create more good paying jobs.'
p308
aS"We don't have enough of either in our society."
p309
aS"And while education is linked to them, it's not this absolute thing."
p310
aS'And we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity.'
p311
aS'And in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity, you start ignoring all these problematic facts, you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound.'
p312
aS"And that's what we want to sort of push back a little bit."
p313
aS"Let me say one thing that we're not arguing for."
p314
aS"We're not saying that nobody should go to college."
p315
aS"We're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing."
p316
aS"We're not saying everybody should drop out."
p317
aS"We're simply saying that too many people are going to college, just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s, doesn't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses, it doesn't mean we should shut down all the colleges, but we shouldn't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice."
p318
aS'And what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future.'
p319
aS"Do not think of education as something that's an automatic ticket to the future, you need to think about it yourself."
p320
aS"If I had to do something over again, having gone to Stanford, I probably would still go to college even with the higher costs, if I didn't have any great ideas of what to do instead I'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the problems."
p321
aS'But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing, that this was the thing you should do without thinking, I would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything.'
p322
aS'The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity, who is accountable if it is a mistake?'
p323
aS'And if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong, where can they go to get a refund?'

aS'When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA.'
p631
aS"I didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest."
p632
aS"Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative."
p633
aS'Almost everybody needs more education after high school.'
p634
aS"What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive, antediluvian thing called a BA."
p635
aS'The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil.'
p636
aS"Let's go through each of those accusations."
p637
aS'First, fraudulent.'
p638
aS'The BA is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated person.'
p639
aS"You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more."
p640
aS"The number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not -- don't exist."
p641
aS"But it's much worse than that."
p642
aS"If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know anything."
p643
aS'If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what?'
p644
aS"They're transmuted into Bs."
p645
aS'And why are they transmuted into Bs?'
p646
aS'Because the story they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can.'
p647
aS"And you've got to retain kids."
p648
aS"And in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college."
p649
aS"You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well."
p650
aS'All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills.'
p651
aS'I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems.'
p652
aS"And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges."
p653
aS"Knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much."
p654
aS"Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering, okay."
p655
aS"But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me."
p656
aS"It doesn't really mean anything."
p657
aS'Now, here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from.'
p658
aS'So if the applicant came from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college.'
p659
aS"You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in."
p660
aS"You don't know anything about what Harvard has added."
p661
aS'And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways.'

p663
aS"The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education."
p664
aS"Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless."
p665
aS'Okay, destructive.'
p666
aS"Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one."
p667
aS"And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA."
p668
aS'The employers know how clueless many of them are.'
p669
aS'Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability.'
p670
aS"So they're being rational."
p671
aS'But the problem is this: We have created a kind of self- fulfilling prophecy.'
p672
aS'We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy.'
p673
aS'And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper.'
p674
aS"It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study."
p675
aS"They aren't there to get an education."
p676
aS"They're there to get a piece of paper."
p677
aS'It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential.'
p678
aS"It is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them."
p679
aS'It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish.'
p680
aS"But most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture."
p681
aS'We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity.'
p682
aS'We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise.'

p686

aS'The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing.'
p689
aS"What's the rationale for having a library these days?"
p690
aS'It used to be central.'

aS"Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given to millions?"
p692
aS"Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before."
p693
aS'The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education.'
p694
aS"Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined."
p695

p854
aS"It's really the knowledge."

p859

aS'These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out the best and the brightest in the world.'
p861
aS'This is why America is what it is.'
p862
aS"Now, another argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college."

aS'A college -- you know, Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley where everyone thinks -- when they think college, they think Stanford.'

aS'They think Berkeley maybe, so, one level below Stanford, but thats it.'

aS'And when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt, $250,000 of debt.'

aS'This is what they were thinking.'
p897
aS'They didnt say it.'
p898
aS'But this is whats happening in the world right now.'

p900
aS'India and China are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year.'
p901
aS'Theyre educating all their people because they know that its going to make them like America, and theyre going to eat our lunch.'
p902
aS'So if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that, were going to lose out.'
p903
aS'You talk about entrepreneurship, again -- again, I have a lot of respect for Peter Thiel while chatting with him, but, you know, he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and be very successful.'
p904
aS'Fine.'
p905
aS'Therere 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in America who dont need to go to college.'
p906
aS'I have researched this systematically.'
p907
aS'What we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the same world that Peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a Bachelors degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees.'
p908
aS'In terms of success, thats how much difference education makes.'
p909
aS'Now, the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesnt matter what school you graduate from.'
p910
aS'The tech founders in America, the most successful people in America graduated from a wide assortment of universities.'
p911
aS'There are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did.'
p912
aS'It didnt matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from Harvard.'
p913
aS'You could still make it big as an entrepreneur.'
p914
aS'Why?'
p915
aS'Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn.'
p916
aS'Now, moving forward, the Indians and Chinese are going to be eating our childrens lunch, guaranteed.'

p942

p947

p948
aS'Everyone is trying to be like us.'
p949

aS'What do they gainfrom our schools?'
p951
aS"It's not the courses."
p952
aS"It's really the knowledge."
p953
aS"It's how to learn."
p954
aS'Yougain social skills.'
p955
aS'You learn how to interact with other people.You learn how to deal with failure, make compromises.'
p956
aS'You learn how to solveproblems.'
p957
aS'These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of makingyou socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out thebest and the brightest in the world.'
p958
aS'This is why America is what it is.'
p959
aS"Now, anotherargument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college."
p960
aS"Charles haswritten a lot about IQ, IQ tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life.To me that's complete baloney."
p961
aS"My whole life I've faced stereotypes because I happento be a race that may not be very smart."
p962
aS"In my youth my people were beggars andsnake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot CEOs.In my lifetime I've seen the transformation of how people perceive me."
p963
aS"So if I was going [[laughter]] by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my peopleshouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to besuccessful, therefore, leave us out.You'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America."
