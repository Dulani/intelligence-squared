aS'Firms and individualsare largely free to buy the labor technology and raw materials they need to produce theproducts they want in open competition with others and to sell them at whatever pricesthe market will bear.'
p40
aS'If you include government-controlled firms, goods produced in amarket system account for a substantially larger share of Chinas output than they do inAmerica.Capitalism requires capital to invest, and over the past 30 years, China has saved nearlyhalf of its total output and has invested most of those savings in capital assets -- plants,machinery, infrastructure, and the like.'
p41
aS'In contrast, the American savings rates havebeen puny, only recently reaching 6 percent of total production.'
p42
aS'And the promise ofcapitalism is that by allowing individuals and firms the freedom to act, resources will beallocated efficiently and the wealth and consumption of most people in the society willgrow.'
p43
aS'China has done a phenomenal job of keeping that promise.'
p44
aS'Over the past 30years, its economy has grown approximately tenfold while Americas has barelydoubled.'

p428
aS'As was stated, China is a communist nation in nameonly.'
p429
aS"It's not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist."
p430
aS'And unfortunatelyChina kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a badname.'
p431
aS'And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not,you know, "Does China do capitalism better?'
p432
aS'" but it might -- but might be, "DoesAmerica do capitalism worse than China?'
p433
aS'" because neither modern America or Chinadoes capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century.'
p434
aS'But the problemis China is closer to what America used to be than America is today.And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, thegovernment in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels, 3 percent.'
p435
aS'Todaythe American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP.'
p436
aS"If you look atChina, it's about half as much of the GDP spent."
p437
aS'If you look at taxes, which is a realmeasure of freedom, back in America in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had nocorporate income tax, no state income taxes, Americans were truly free in the sensethat they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor.'
p438
aS'If you look at modernAmerica and modern China, taxes are very high.'
p439
aS"They're just a lot higher here than theyare in China."
p440
aS"Individual income taxes, the typical American pays a much higher share ofhis income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payrolltaxes and the employer portion that's passed on, paying much higher income taxes on apersonal level than the typical Chinese worker does."
p441
aS"If you look at corporations, ourcorporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, China's 25, we tax dividends at 15percent, they're at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money thatthe individuals are allowed to keep.You know, the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn,and that's what's freedom, it's keeping the fruits of your labor."
p442
aS'Also, if you look at theregulatory environment in both China and the United States, I would argue that a youngentrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles inhis path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China.The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs inChina, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is abyproduct of those rules and regulations.'
p443
aS"A lot of the things that the government does,if employers don't do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits,not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don't facethat kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China.So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point ofview of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation."
p444
aS'I mean, China is not ascapitalistic as Hong Kong, which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than themainland.'
p445
aS"But if you're going to compare it to the United States, the level of taxation,the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, I mean, America has -- ourgovernment has an enormous debt."
p446
aS'Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP, and thatis if you just count the funded portion of our debt.'
p447
aS"If you look at the off budget items,the unfunded portion of our debt, it's enormous."
p448
aS"The Chinese government doesn't haveanywhere near that kind of liability."
p449
aS'In fact, if you look at China and the United Statesand just compare the results of their economy.'
p450
aS'China is today, the worlds largestcreditor nation.'
p451
aS'America is the worlds biggest debtor nation.'
p452
aS'China has large tradesurpluses.'
p453
aS'America has enormous trade deficits.So if you thought about it as a nation, China has got -- I mean if you thought about thenation as a country, or as a corporation rather, China has a lot of assets on its balancesheet and lots of income, lots of profits.'
p454
aS'America is loaded up with liabilities and werehemorrhaging red ink.'
p455
aS'We have huge losses.'
p456
aS'So if you think that America is morecapitalist than China or China is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is abetter economic system because after all, the Chinese are more successful if you wantto measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade.'
p457
aS'So, and Idont think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the Soviet Union, whichwas a Communist country, the Soviet Union didnt make anything, they didnt produceanything.'
p458
aS'We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves.Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States; they havethis enormous trade surplus.And more importantly, theyre accumulating massive savings.'
p459
aS'If you look at China, theyhave a savings rate of close to 50 percent.'
p460
aS'We have a savings rate, basically negative.'
p461
aS'Infact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security.'
p462
aS'They dont have SocialSecurity in China.'
p463
aS'They dont have a lot of these big government programs that we havein the United States.'
p464
aS'Look at our monetary system.'
p465
aS'We have the Federal Reserve, pricefixing, interest rates at practically zero.'
p466
aS'In all the macroeconomics and balances that wecreate, we micromanage our economy through our tax code.'
p467
aS'Weve got the U.S.government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages inthe United States, so its not up to the free market.'
p468
aS'Credit isnt being allocated by themarket; its being allocated by government.'
p469
aS'Government is deciding who should getmoney and who shouldnt get money and who it should subsidize and who it shouldpenalize.'
p470
aS'It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve.Yes, youve got something similar going on in China, only in China I think its more aboveboard.'
p471
aS'Yes, there is government and you know that governments involved and maybeyou have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the UnitedStates.'
p472
aS'Were just not as above board with it.'
p473
aS'And if you think about the partnershipthat government has with business in the United States, most of the laws andregulations, and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this isthe same with industries all over the United States.'
p474
aS'You have all these regulatory bodiesthat are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to preventsmaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that havecaptured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them.'
p475
aS'And that is a function ofgovernment, and its a combination of big business working with big government tostifle innovation and to stifle capitalism.'
p476
aS'And when you have the U.S. governmenttaking such an enormous share of our GDP and taking such an enormous share of ouroutput in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from WashingtonD.C., were not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the United States.The unfortunate thing is that China is closer.'
p477

p615
aS'Look, the Chinese system is not just capitalist; its state capitalist.'
p616
aS'State capitalism is a system where the state is the principal actor in the economy.'
p617
aS'And it uses markets ultimately for their own political gain.'

aS'Thats not capitalism.'
p628
aS'Thats a problem.'
p629
aS'Ultimately, when weve seen state capitalism work globally, it works until it fails.'
p630
aS'And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and I suspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, but it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff.'
p631
aS'Argentina was state capitalist, looked as good as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran out of cheap land.'
p632
aS'And then they started defaulting.'
p633

aS'And weve never seen steering.'
p640

p658
aS'And yeah, its about quality of life.'
p659
aS'Yeah, its about the environment.'
p660
aS'Yeah, its about opportunities for their kids.'

p707
aS'I dont knoweven where to start on this frankly, having just heard that China needs to bribe the rightbureaucrats--but same in the United States, were not as above board about that...Thats on its face ludicrous, right?'
p708
aS'China is a system where if you want to do well, thehighest levels, 52 percent of the GDP -- 62 percent of the GDP is state-ownedenterprises, absolutely there is no rule of law.'
p709
aS'Theres no transparency.'
p710

p711

p713

p714
aS'It is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective oreven most rapacious form.'
p715
aS'Thats the state doing what it wants to do for the state.Thats the problem.'
p716
aS'You want to talk about state intervention?'
p717
aS'Weve got it.'

aS'Weve gotit in China.'

aS'Look, its unfortunate to me were even debating this.'
p720
aS'Five years ago, wewouldnt.'
p721
aS'It shames me.'
p722
aS'It shames me as an American because there are people outthere that believe that the United States cant do capitalism as well as China.'
p723
aS'There arecountries now that are doing capitalism better than the United States.'
p724
aS'If we werehaving this debate about Canada, we wouldnt have as much of a problem.'
p725
aS'Wewouldnt, right.'
p726
aS'On a lot of fronts -- Im willing -- Im not saying the United States isworse on everything.Im saying that life increasingly, if you look at issues like the deficit for the U.S., if youlook at financial regulations -- Im not going to stand behind all that.'
p727
aS'But I am going togo after China, because ultimately we have a problem.'
p728
aS'Look, the Chinese system is notjust capitalist; its state capitalist.'
p729
aS'State capitalism is a system where the state is theprincipal actor in the economy.'
p730
aS'And it uses markets ultimately for their own politicalgain.'
p731
aS'If it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain, theyll go for it.'
p732
aS'If it turnsout it isnt, theyll go against it.'
p733
aS'And thats true whether were talking about Chinesefirms or whether were talking about Western firms.'
p734
aS'I mean, Facebooks doing a prettygood IPO, but theyre not in China.'
p735
aS'Why?'
p736
aS'China doesnt want Facebook in China.'
p737
aS'Itdmake a lot of money.'
p738
aS'Itd make a lot of money for China.'
p739
aS'Thats not the point, right.Thats not capitalism.'
p740
aS'Thats a problem.'
p741
aS'Ultimately, when weve seen state capitalismwork globally, it works until it fails.And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and Isuspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, butit can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff.'
p742
aS'Argentina was state capitalist, looked asgood as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ranout of cheap land.'
p743
aS'And then they started defaulting.'
p744
aS'Venezuela looked great on cheapoil.'
p745
aS'Not so much anymore, right.'
p746
aS'Chinas looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheaplabor.'
p747
aS'China will ultimately run out of cheap labor.'
p748
aS'So, what we have in China is thisextraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road.'
p749
aS'And that roadhas been straight for 34 years, but coming up theres a big turn in the road.'
p750
aS'And wevenever seen steering.Maybe -- thank you, mom -- maybe -- [[applause]] Maybe they have steering, but we dont know.'
p751
aS'[[laughter]] And the fact is that if you are China, theres one thing youre going to have a very hardtime doing.'
p752
aS'There are no more Zhu Rongjis and Deng Xiaopings in China.'
p753
aS'You donthave strong individual leadership.'
p754
aS'You have leadership by consensus, individuals thatare moving together very incrementally.'
p755
aS'Theyre very cautious.'
p756
aS'They understand theimportance of the stakes they are playing for.'
p757
aS'The one thing that you will not do well isgo after your own intrinsic interests.'
p758
aS'The state-owned enterprises that are providingyou money -- thats where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets moreexpensive.'
p759
aS'Thats where the inefficiency will be when the United States and otherWestern multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off.'
p760
aS'Another problem withChinese state capitalism is it creates enemies, you know.'
p761
aS'There are a lot of folks aroundAsia.'
p762
aS'They see the Chinese economic miracle, but theyre begging the United States tomaintain a presence.Why?'

p939
aS"But there's a reason China is growing fast."
p940
aS'Low income countries tend to grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential.'
p941
aS'Just think of two things.'
p942
aS'Consumption of energy.'
p943
aS'Chinese consumption of energy is about one-fourth of the U.S. consumption.'
p944
aS'So the Chinese, if they consume more energy, they will grow a lot faster.'
p945
aS'The same with steel production.'
p946
aS'China consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average American consumes.'
p947
aS'So if they want to reach American consumption, they need to build a lot of steel plants, and that makes economic growth.'
p948
aS'So first of all, do not judge whether a country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers.'
p949
aS'Second is that when you compare the two countries, the U.S. and China, you have to look at facts.'
p950
aS'This presentation is nothing but man the facts.'

p952
aS'If you look at corporate profits, U.S. companies are far more profitable than Chinese companies.'

aS'And that is to think that we can trust Chinese accounting.'
p954
aS'And then you look at tax collection.'
p955
aS'I have to disagree with Peter.'
p956
aS'He says the Chinese, they collect less taxes than U.S.'
p957
aS'The opposite is true.'
p958
aS'The U.S. government takes about federal/state, about 30 percent of GDP.'
p959
aS'The Chinese government collects 35 percent.'
p960
aS'But thats not the end of the story.'
p961
aS'Because in the U.S., you actually get something back from the government in the form of Social Security, health care, Medicare, Medicaid.'
p962
aS'In China, you get very little back because the bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption, administration.'
p963
aS'If you go to China and get treated to a 20-course meal, you think great, thats Chinese hospitality.'
p964
aS'But dont forget, its being paid for by Chinese taxpayers.'
p965
aS'Not in the USA.'
p966
aS'You do not get that kind of treatment when you go to Washington, D.C. And then you look at whether Chinas growth is using less natural resources.'
p967
aS'And here the U.S. is three times more efficient as China.'
p968
aS'Because for every dollar of GDP produced in China, China has to consume three times more in terms of its natural resources, water, clean air, land.'
p969
aS'The U.S. in other words, is a lot more efficient.'
p970
aS'Then you look at international comparisons, and here were using third-party numbers.'
p971
aS'And here, China does not look nearly as good as the U.S.'
p972
aS'Corruption.'
p973
aS'Theres a NGO based in Berlin called Transparency International.'
p974
aS'It publishes every year, a global index called Corruption Perception index.'
p975
aS'This index, the U.S. is ranked 24th in terms of, as the least corrupt country in the world.'
p976
aS'China is ranked 75.'
p977
aS'So if you think our average politician in Washington is corrupt, wait until you meet a Chinese politician.'
p978
aS'Then you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its efficiency and competitiveness.'
p979
aS'Here, the U.S. is ranked not number one, number five.'
p980
aS'What about China?'
p981
aS'China is number 26.'
p982
aS'So way, way behind the U.S. Then you look at something like innovation ranking.'
p983
aS'The U.S. is number seven; China is 29.'
p984
aS'You look at ease of doing business.'
p985
aS'This is by the World Bank.'
p986
aS'Because, a real capitalist country should be one in which it is very easy to do business.'
p987
aS'Overall ranking for the U.S. is number four in the world.'
p988
aS'China is number 91.'
p989
aS'Then starting a business, U.S. is number 13; China is number 151.'
p990
aS'Getting credit, the U.S. is number four; China is number 67.'
p991
aS'The list goes on and on and I dont want to bore you.'
p992
aS'Finally, I want to imagine, what will the politburo members think about this debate?'
p993
aS'If for some reason, theyve learned that in New York City, theyre debating whether China does capitalism better than the U.S.'
p994
aS'I think their first reaction is not to laugh.'
p995

p996
aS'You stage an Olympics.'

p999
aS'They think the U.S. is falling behind.'
p1000
aS'Then you lend the Americans $2 trillion.'
p1001
aS'They think, China is definitely number one.'
p1002
aS'So, the third thought that would come to their mind is that the Americans have very short memories, because when Sputnik was launched, everybody thought the Soviet Union was to dominate the world.'
p1003
aS'And then in the late 1980s, I think in this city, people should have good memories about who was buying the Rockefeller Center, right.'
p1004
aS'Japan was dominating the headlines.'
p1005
aS'Everybody thought Japan was doing capitalism better than the U.S. Now, look at where Japan is after 20 years.'
p1006
aS'So, I think what were seeing here is not that China does capitalism better than the U.S.; we are experiencing a period of self-doubt.'
p1007
aS'Im sure the real issue is not about China.'
p1008
aS'The real issue is about the U.S.'
