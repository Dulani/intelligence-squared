S'Thank you. Welcome. Its good to have you here. My role in these proceedings is to'
p32
aS'frame the debate. So, "China does capitalism better than America. Capitalism is the'
p33
aS'polar opposite of Communism, so how can Communist China be said to do capitalism'
p34
aS'better than America? Its because China is Communist in name only. In most of the'
p35
aS'ways that matter, the Chinese economy is a model of capitalism. Firms and individuals'
p36
aS'are largely free to buy the labor technology and raw materials they need to produce the'
p37
aS'products they want in open competition with others and to sell them at whatever prices'
p38
aS'the market will bear. If you include government-controlled firms, goods produced in a'
p39
aS'market system account for a substantially larger share of Chinas output than they do in'
p40
aS'America.'
p41
aS'Capitalism requires capital to invest, and over the past 30 years, China has saved nearly'
p42
aS'half of its total output and has invested most of those savings in capital assets -- plants,'
p43
aS'machinery, infrastructure, and the like. In contrast, the American savings rates have'
p44
aS'been puny, only recently reaching 6 percent of total production. And the promise of'
p45
aS'capitalism is that by allowing individuals and firms the freedom to act, resources will be'
p46
aS'allocated efficiently and the wealth and consumption of most people in the society will'
p47
aS'grow. China has done a phenomenal job of keeping that promise. Over the past 30'
p48
aS'years, its economy has grown approximately tenfold while Americas has barely'
p49
aS'doubled. In what respects then does America do capitalism better?'
p50
aS'Clearly, the rule of law is much more developed here. Property rights are more secure,'
p51
aS'and we encourage innovation by protecting intellectual property. As a result, the'
p52
aS'American economy is far more innovative. The Googles and Facebooks and Apples of'
p53
aS'the world are American companies. Nothing comparable has come from China. We'
p54
aS'permit individuals to move freely in search of jobs and opportunities. For hundreds of'
p55
aS'millions of rural Chinese, there is no such freedom. Corruption and abuse of power by'
p56
aS'government officials is far more prevalent in China. And crony capitalism, which is'
p57
aS'certainly an aspect of American life, is absolutely rife in China. As usual, there is a lot to'
p58
aS'be said on both sides. And in the final analysis, this debate is not just about economics'
p59
aS'but about which system, American democratic capitalism or Chinese state capitalism,'
p60
aS'will be the model that developing countries around the world admire and seek to'
p61
aS'emulate.'
p62
aS'We have an outstanding panel of experts tonight, and its my privilege to turn the'
p63
aS'evening over to them and to our moderator John Donvan.'

S"That's all you can come up with? As was stated, China is a communist nation in name"
p303
aS"only. It's not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist. And unfortunately"
p304
aS'China kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad'
p305
aS'name. And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not,'
p306
aS'you know, "Does China do capitalism better?" but it might -- but might be, "Does'
p307
aS'America do capitalism worse than China?" because neither modern America or China'
p308
aS'does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century. But the problem'
p309
aS'is China is closer to what America used to be than America is today.'
p310
aS'And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900, the'
p311
aS'government in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels, 3 percent. Today'
p312
aS'the American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP. If you look at'
p313
aS"China, it's about half as much of the GDP spent. If you look at taxes, which is a real"
p314
aS'measure of freedom, back in America in the 1900s, we had no income taxes, we had no'
p315
aS'corporate income tax, no state income taxes, Americans were truly free in the sense'
p316
aS'that they got to keep the production, the fruits of their labor. If you look at modern'
p317
aS"America and modern China, taxes are very high. They're just a lot higher here than they"
p318
aS'are in China. Individual income taxes, the typical American pays a much higher share of'
p319
aS'his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll'
p320
aS"taxes and the employer portion that's passed on, paying much higher income taxes on a"
p321
aS'personal level than the typical Chinese worker does. If you look at corporations, our'
p322
aS"corporate income tax now is, what, 35 percent, China's 25, we tax dividends at 15"
p323
aS"percent, they're at 10 percent, so a significant difference in the amount of money that"
p324
aS'the individuals are allowed to keep.'
p325
aS'You know, the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn,'
p326
aS"and that's what's freedom, it's keeping the fruits of your labor. Also, if you look at the"
p327
aS'regulatory environment in both China and the United States, I would argue that a young'
p328
aS'entrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles, bigger obstacles in'
p329
aS'his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China.'
p330
aS'The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs in'
p331
aS'China, and not just the rules and regulations, but surviving the litigation that is a'
p332
aS'byproduct of those rules and regulations. A lot of the things that the government does,'
p333
aS"if employers don't do them properly, they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits,"
p334
aS"not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you don't face"
p335
aS'that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China.'
p336
aS'So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation, you look at it from the point of'
p337
aS'view of regulation, sure, both countries have a lot of regulation. I mean, China is not as'
p338
aS'capitalistic as Hong Kong, which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than the'
p339
aS"mainland. But if you're going to compare it to the United States, the level of taxation,"
p340
aS'the level of government spending, if you look at the debt, I mean, America has -- our'
p341
aS'government has an enormous debt. Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP, and that'
p342
aS'is if you just count the funded portion of our debt. If you look at the off budget items,'
p343
aS"the unfunded portion of our debt, it's enormous. The Chinese government doesn't have"
p344
aS'anywhere near that kind of liability. In fact, if you look at China and the United States'
p345
aS'and just compare the results of their economy. China is today, the worlds largest'
p346
aS'creditor nation. America is the worlds biggest debtor nation. China has large trade'
p347
aS'surpluses. America has enormous trade deficits.'
p348
aS'So if you thought about it as a nation, China has got -- I mean if you thought about the'
p349
aS'nation as a country, or as a corporation rather, China has a lot of assets on its balance'
p350
aS'sheet and lots of income, lots of profits. America is loaded up with liabilities and were'
p351
aS'hemorrhaging red ink. We have huge losses. So if you think that America is more'
p352
aS'capitalist than China or China is more socialist, then you must think that socialism is a'
p353
aS'better economic system because after all, the Chinese are more successful if you want'
p354
aS'to measure it by the accumulation of assets, by the positive balance of trade. So, and I'
p355
aS'dont think that there is a way for a country, if you remember the Soviet Union, which'
p356
aS'was a Communist country, the Soviet Union didnt make anything, they didnt produce'
p357
aS'anything. We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves.'
p358
aS'Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States; they have'
p359
aS'this enormous trade surplus.'
p360
aS'And more importantly, theyre accumulating massive savings. If you look at China, they'
p361
aS'have a savings rate of close to 50 percent. We have a savings rate, basically negative. In'
p362
aS'fact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security. They dont have Social'
p363
aS'Security in China. They dont have a lot of these big government programs that we have'
p364
aS'in the United States. Look at our monetary system. We have the Federal Reserve, price'
p365
aS'fixing, interest rates at practically zero. In all the macroeconomics and balances that we'
p366
aS'create, we micromanage our economy through our tax code. Weve got the U.S.'
p367
aS'government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in'
p368
aS'the United States, so its not up to the free market. Credit isnt being allocated by the'
p369
aS'market; its being allocated by government. Government is deciding who should get'
p370
aS'money and who shouldnt get money and who it should subsidize and who it should'
p371
aS'penalize. It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve.'
p372
aS'Yes, youve got something similar going on in China, only in China I think its more above'
p373
aS'board. Yes, there is government and you know that governments involved and maybe'
p374
aS'you have to bribe the right bureaucrat, but the same thing is going on in the United'
p375
aS'States. Were just not as above board with it. And if you think about the partnership'
p376
aS'that government has with business in the United States, most of the laws and'
p377
aS'regulations, and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry, but this is'
p378
aS'the same with industries all over the United States. You have all these regulatory bodies'
p379
aS'that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent'
p380
aS'smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have'
p381
aS'captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them. And that is a function of'

aS'government, and its a combination of big business working with big government to'

S'First of all, Orville said that China is a fickle mistress. And so getting China right is hard.'
p423
aS'And one thing we do all need to admit is that the level of volatility in outcomes in China'
p424
aS'over the next 10 to 20 years is vastly greater than the level of volatility in the United'
p425
aS'States or in Europe or Japan. Can China make it? Can they fundamentally transform'
p426
aS'their economic and political system? A country of 1.3 billion people. We know they'
p427
aS'need to it. The World Bank just made it very clear. The Chinese government admitted it'
p428
aS'themselves. Doesnt mean they can do it, its never been done before. Its a bet. Id'
p429
aS'bet against. But its a bet. If you have to make a bet, you bet on the United States. Lots'
p430
aS'of people do, thats why the U.S. still has the worlds reserve currency. I dont know'
p431
aS'even where to start on this frankly, having just heard that China needs to bribe the right'
p432
aS'bureaucrats--but same in the United States, were not as above board about that...'
p433
aS'Thats on its face ludicrous, right? China is a system where if you want to do well, the'
p434
aS'highest levels, 52 percent of the GDP -- 62 percent of the GDP is state-owned'
p435
aS'enterprises, absolutely there is no rule of law. Theres no transparency. You dont have'
p436
aS'as many regulations in China as the U.S. That is true. Does that mean China does'
p437
aS'capitalism better? No. It means that if youre China and you want to move a village and'
p438
aS'build a road, you can. It is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective or'
p439
aS'even most rapacious form. Thats the state doing what it wants to do for the state.'
p440
aS'Thats the problem. You want to talk about state intervention? Weve got it. Weve got'
p441
aS'it in China. Look, its unfortunate to me were even debating this. Five years ago, we'
p442
aS'wouldnt. It shames me. It shames me as an American because there are people out'
p443
aS'there that believe that the United States cant do capitalism as well as China. There are'
p444
aS'countries now that are doing capitalism better than the United States. If we were'
p445
aS'having this debate about Canada, we wouldnt have as much of a problem. We'
p446
aS'wouldnt, right. On a lot of fronts -- Im willing -- Im not saying the United States is'
p447
aS'worse on everything.'
p448
aS'Im saying that life increasingly, if you look at issues like the deficit for the U.S., if you'
p449
aS'look at financial regulations -- Im not going to stand behind all that. But I am going to'
p450
aS'go after China, because ultimately we have a problem. Look, the Chinese system is not'
p451
aS'just capitalist; its state capitalist. State capitalism is a system where the state is the'
p452
aS'principal actor in the economy. And it uses markets ultimately for their own political'
p453
aS'gain. If it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain, theyll go for it. If it turns'
p454
aS'out it isnt, theyll go against it. And thats true whether were talking about Chinese'
p455
aS'firms or whether were talking about Western firms. I mean, Facebooks doing a pretty'
p456
aS'good IPO, but theyre not in China. Why? China doesnt want Facebook in China. Itd'
p457
aS'make a lot of money. Itd make a lot of money for China. Thats not the point, right.'
p458
aS'Thats not capitalism. Thats a problem. Ultimately, when weve seen state capitalism'
p459
aS'work globally, it works until it fails.'
p460
aS'And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient, and I'
p461
aS'suspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient, and it is in lots of forms, but'
p462
aS'it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff. Argentina was state capitalist, looked as'
p463
aS'good as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran'
p464
aS'out of cheap land. And then they started defaulting. Venezuela looked great on cheap'
p465
aS'oil. Not so much anymore, right. Chinas looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheap'
p466
aS'labor. China will ultimately run out of cheap labor. So, what we have in China is this'
p467
aS'extraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road. And that road'
p468
aS'has been straight for 34 years, but coming up theres a big turn in the road. And weve'
p469
aS'never seen steering.'
p470
aS'Maybe -- thank you, mom -- maybe --'
p471
aS'Maybe they have steering, but we dont know.'
p472
aS'And the fact is that if you are China, theres one thing youre going to have a very hard'
p473
aS'time doing. There are no more Zhu Rongjis and Deng Xiaopings in China. You dont'
p474
aS'have strong individual leadership. You have leadership by consensus, individuals that'
p475
aS'are moving together very incrementally. Theyre very cautious. They understand the'
p476
aS'importance of the stakes they are playing for. The one thing that you will not do well is'
p477
aS'go after your own intrinsic interests. The state-owned enterprises that are providing'
p478
aS'you money -- thats where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets more'
p479
aS'expensive. Thats where the inefficiency will be when the United States and other'
p480
aS'Western multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off. Another problem with'
p481
aS'Chinese state capitalism is it creates enemies, you know. There are a lot of folks around'
p482
aS'Asia. They see the Chinese economic miracle, but theyre begging the United States to'
p483
aS'maintain a presence.'
p484
aS'Why? Because China does capitalism better than the United States? I dont think so.'
p485
aS'We got to watch what people do, not what people say, what they do. Did you see that'
p486
aS'piece in the Wall Street Journal, talked about the disposition of Chinese millionaires,'
p487
aS'how over 50 percent of Chinese millionaires say they prefer to live in the United States'
p488
aS'than China? And yeah, its about quality of life. Yeah, its about the environment. Yeah,'
p489
aS'its about opportunities for their kids. Its also about no rule of law in China and'
p490
aS'worrying about corruption and the sanctity of their assets over the long term. Your'
p491
aS'assets are okay tomorrow. The United States, were over-litigious. China doesnt have'
p492
aS'that problem. You dont have to worry about lawyers in China. You have to worry'
p493
aS'about someone ripping off your stuff or being forced out of the country or not being'
p494
aS'heard from again. Now, maybe Peter believes that those 50-plus percent of Chinese'
p495
aS'millionaires are stupid. Because ultimately, the United States is in decline, and so they'
p496
aS'shouldnt be coming here, in which case, fine, but then Chinas millionaires arent that'
p497
aS'bright. And those are the entrepreneurs, so we shouldnt bet on them either way.'
p498
aS'Youre in a catch-22, sir.'
p499
aS'You know, Im interested in what the Chinese do with their money. I understand that'
p500
aS'the Chinese are saying that they dont like the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, but'
p501
aS'where are they putting their cash? In the U.S. Now, Ron Paul and Peter say they'
p502
aS'shouldnt do that, and then were in big trouble. Okay, well, when are they going to'
p503
aS'stop? Because I dont believe the Chinese are stupid. For me, thats not an interesting'
p504
aS'analytical model. For me, whats interesting is presuming the Chinese understand their'
p505
aS'interests and theyre putting all that money into treasuries because they believe thats'
p506
aS'safe over the long term. We are entering an environment of fear. Were entering an'
p507
aS'environment of volatility. When things get more volatile, we dont just bet on go-go-'
p508
aS'growth any more. We put our money under the mattresses. Central banks do that too.'
p509
aS'And in that environment, the worlds largest economy, also ultimately the most'
p510

S'Well, I find myself in the awkward position, being an American, deeply believing in this'
p541
aS'country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers, to defend a'
p542
aS'Marxist-Leninist economy. And I beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my'
p543
aS'argument and please convince me I am wrong by voting against me at the end of this'
p544
aS'debate.'
p545
aS'I would say that the comparison between capitalism in the United States and China is as'
p546
aS'much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise. And'
p547
aS'there, in a very counterintuitive way, one we hardly have expected, the Chinese'
p548
aS'Communist Party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under'
p549
aS'Leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which I think all of us'
p550
aS'would agree, over the past three decades, has been quite extraordinary -- something'
p551
aS'none of us who were standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square of 1989 when there'
p552
aS'were a million people demonstrating there, thought could ever possibly happen.'
p553
aS'So, I think if we look at America, we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological'
p554
aS'self-doubt at this particular moment. We find a country that has had much of its'
p555
aS'government, many of its leaders besieged by irrationality, religiosity, they dont believe'
p556
aS'in evolution, they dont believe in climate change, we cannot pass a simple measure in'
p557
aS'Congress to extend the national debt, which is not going to not happen. How can a'
p558
aS'government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason, how can it be the'
p559
aS'custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside'
p560
aS'over?'
p561
aS'This is not to say that we dont venerate entrepreneurs, we dont venerate innovation,'
p562
aS'and we dont believe in a free economy. But let me read you just simply what Adam'
p563
aS'Smith had to say, the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism. He said that when'
p564
aS'the security of the whole society is at stake, natural liberty of a few individuals which'
p565
aS'might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments, the'
p566
aS'most free as well as the most despotical. And I think it is precisely here that we have'
p567
aS'failed. And by doing so, we have lent a greater credence to this curious, cryptic, hybrid'
p568
aS'version of Leninist capital, which China has employed, to quite a bit of success, I would'
p569
aS'have to say.'
p570
aS"So let's quickly just look at what we see in China. I spoke of the psychological dimension"
p571
aS'of the problem in this country, and I think everybody in this room feels it. There is a'
p572
aS'sense of I think lassitude. At the same time, greed is quite a force lost in the land.'
p573
aS"There's a great deal of self deception at work. If you look at China, who's running the"
p574
aS"government in China now? They're all engineers. In many ways, the very things that we"
p575
aS'used to impute to China as a great weakness, namely, a over reliance on ideology, are'
p576
aS'now the very things that are hampering our own country, while China, governed by'
p577
aS'engineers and technocrats, tends to look at reason. There are no climate deniers in'
p578
aS'China. I have never spoken to a Chinese who doubted evolution.'
p579
aS'And yet the ranks of the American political houses of Congress are replete with these'
p580
aS"people, and they're making decisions which govern how we live and govern the"
p581
aS'American economy. China also has managed in a way that I think it deserves our'
p582
aS'esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done.'
p583
aS'When a stimulus program needs to be enacted, they look at the facts and they enact it.'
p584
aS'Do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to'
p585
aS'some retrograde period of Stalinist economics? Well, I think the United States could do'
p586
aS"with a good five-year plan. We can't plan for three months ahead."
p587
aS'We have no ability even to execute policy, much less long range policy. If you go to'
p588
aS'Washington, you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy'
p589
aS'documents. Why? Because nobody can do anything with them. I think this ability of'
p590
aS'China to martial facts rationally, to martial its resources and make policy and allocate'
p591
aS'capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own'
p592
aS'country could learn from. I want to read a quick quote from Henny Sender from the'
p593
aS'Financial Times. "The combination of Chinese SOEs and debt from state owned banks is'
p594
aS'a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of China as well as within it." I'
p595
aS"think that's an interesting statement from a paper that's basically a laissez faire"
p596
aS'capitalist paper.'
p597
aS'So finally I would say that we would do well not to assume that China has nothing to'
p598
aS'teach the United States. It may be that this system will not endure in the future. It has'
p599
aS'many structural weaknesses. But to date I would say it has been ascending while our'
p600
aS'own form of capitalism, replete with the weaknesses that you all well know, has been in'
p601
aS'a state of decline. And whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its'
p602
aS'final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come.'

S"I'm not going to speak in Chinese. I think that the impression that China is doing"
p642
aS"capitalism better than the U.S. is understandable. That's because it's a very superficial"
p643
aS'impression. One reason why that impression is widespread is that China has been'
p644
aS"growing fast. But there's a reason China is growing fast. Low income countries tend to"
p645
aS'grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential.'
p646
aS'Just think of two things. Consumption of energy. Chinese consumption of energy is'
p647
aS'about one-fourth of the U.S. consumption.'
p648
aS'So the Chinese, if they consume more energy, they will grow a lot faster. The same with'
p649
aS'steel production. China consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average American'
p650
aS'consumes. So if they want to reach American consumption, they need to build a lot of'
p651
aS'steel plants, and that makes economic growth. So first of all, do not judge whether a'
p652
aS'country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers. Second'
p653
aS'is that when you compare the two countries, the U.S. and China, you have to look at'
p654
aS'facts. This presentation is nothing but man the facts. So what are'
p655
aS'the facts? If you look at corporate profits, U.S. companies are far more profitable than'
p656
aS'Chinese companies. And that is to think that we can trust Chinese accounting.'
p657
aS'And then you look at tax collection. I have to disagree with Peter.'
p658
aS'He says the Chinese, they collect less taxes than U.S. The opposite is true. The U.S.'
p659
aS'government takes about federal/state, about 30 percent of GDP. The Chinese'
p660
aS'government collects 35 percent. But thats not the end of the story. Because in the'
p661
aS'U.S., you actually get something back from the government in the form of Social'
p662
aS'Security, health care, Medicare, Medicaid. In China, you get very little back because the'
p663
aS'bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption, administration. If you'
p664
aS'go to China and get treated to a 20-course meal, you think great, thats Chinese'
p665
aS'hospitality. But dont forget, its being paid for by Chinese taxpayers. Not in the USA.'
p666
aS'You do not get that kind of treatment when you go to Washington, D.C.'
p667
aS'And then you look at whether Chinas growth is using less natural resources.'
p668
aS'And here the U.S. is three times more efficient as China. Because for every dollar of'
p669
aS'GDP produced in China, China has to consume three times more in terms of its natural'
p670
aS'resources, water, clean air, land. The U.S. in other words, is a lot more efficient. Then'
p671
aS'you look at international comparisons, and here were using third-party numbers. And'
p672
aS'here, China does not look nearly as good as the U.S. Corruption. Theres a NGO based'
p673
aS'in Berlin called Transparency International. It publishes every year, a global index called'
p674
aS'Corruption Perception index. This index, the U.S. is ranked 24th in terms of, as the least'
p675
aS'corrupt country in the world. China is ranked 75. So if you think our average politician'
p676
aS'in Washington is corrupt, wait until you meet a Chinese politician.'
p677
aS'Then you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its'
p678
aS'efficiency and competitiveness. Here, the U.S. is ranked not number one, number five.'
p679
aS'What about China? China is number 26. So way, way behind the U.S. Then you look at'
p680
aS'something like innovation ranking. The U.S. is number seven; China is 29. You look at'
p681
aS'ease of doing business. This is by the World Bank. Because, a real capitalist country'
p682
aS'should be one in which it is very easy to do business. Overall ranking for the U.S. is'
p683
aS'number four in the world. China is number 91. Then starting a business, U.S. is number'
p684
aS'13; China is number 151. Getting credit, the U.S. is number four; China is number 67.'
p685
aS'The list goes on and on and I dont want to bore you.'
p686
aS'Finally, I want to imagine, what will the politburo members think about this debate? If'
p687
aS'for some reason, theyve learned that in New York City, theyre debating whether China'
p688

aS'me. We have here two teams of two who are arguing out this motion: "China does'
p731
aS'capitalism better than America. Weve heard the team arguing in support of the'
p732
aS'motion, Peter Schiff and Orville Schell, basically saying that China does capitalism better'
p733
aS'because theres actually more freedom to do things that involved capitalism, that there'
p734
aS'are fewer regulations, that there are lower taxes.'
p735
aS'It is not pure capitalism and theyre not arguing that, but theyre saying that its more'
p736
aS'pure than the U.S. has had in the last 100 years. Chinas amazing growth rate really'
p737
aS'seals the argument for them, but they also make the point that possibly an economy'
p738
aS'operating under the apparatus of what we call a democracy in this country has its'
p739
aS'downside. And they suggest that maybe a little planning is not such a bad thing. The'
p740
aS'team arguing against the motion, Ian Bremmer and Minxin Pei. Theyre making the'
p741
aS'argument that what Chinas doing, even if it could be called capitalism, is something'
p742
aS'thats probably cruising for a crash, that when the government is the biggest player in'
p743
aS'the market, as they argue that it is, point out that it is, this tends to lead to corruption'
p744
aS'and to cronyism and ultimately to exposure of the lack of real innovation.'
p745
aS'They basically are also making something of a hare and hedgehog argument and'
p746
aS'pointing out that China is the hare and its in a good dash right now, but that the U.S. is'
p747
aS'the hedgehog, plodding along steadily and more reliably. So, I want to take a question'
p748
aS'from this sides argument to that side, and thats that argument that what were seeing'
p749
aS'from China, this enormous growth rate, your opponents have pointed out, number one,'
p750
aS'is the result of China coming off a much lower baseline. And when things get really'
p751
aS'volatile, things can really fall apart there. And theyre essentially saying that whats'
p752

p761
aS'capitalism now in China, and its that freedom, its that -- those market forces that are'
p762
aS'responsible for the growth, not that because theyre poor, because there were plenty of'

aS'The Chinese, theyre not making a big bet on the U.S. treasury market because they'
p2198
aS'want to. Its because they think they have to. If they can wave a wand and replace all'
p2199
aS'their treasures with gold, theyd do it. The problem is theyre afraid. Because they'
p2200
aS'know if they try to sell, theyll crush the market. But we are on the verge of this'
p2201
aS'collapse. And its because we abandoned all the principles of capitalism that we once'
p2202
aS'had. And these are the principles that China is now adopting. As I said earlier, whats'
p2203
aS'really more important is the pendulum and the direction in which its swinging. Look at'

aS'where we started from complete capitalism. And China started, they had none of it.'
p2205
aS'Look at how much ground weve surrendered and look at how much the Chinese have'
p2206
aS'gained. Is China perfect? Not at all. They still have a lot of progress to make. But they'
p2207
aS'are making that progress. The problem with us is were still moving in the wrong'
p2208
aS'direction. And were moving in that direction more rapidly. And when we actually have'
p2209
aS'our crisis; when we have a sovereign debt crisis, when the dollar really plunges and we'
p2210
aS'really have to confront the grim reality of our situation, the fact that weve been living'
p2211
aS'beyond our means for generations and it has to come to an end, then we can have this'
