p66
aS'The important role of a bank in our economic system is to lend money to consumers'
p67
aS'who want to spend or to businesses who want to invest. And some of these banks are'
p68
aS'so large, about a dozen of them, that the government has designated them as too big'
p69
aS'to fail, which means that they have an implicit government guarantee. But those banks'
p70
aS'are doing so many things beyond that basic function that the argument would be that'
p71
aS'this is simply a step too far for the government to be guaranteeing all these other'
p72
aS'activities. These big banks are too complex to manage, as we see.'
p73
aS"Run well, et cetera, et cetera. They may be too opaque to regulate. And also it's an"
p74
aS'unfair competitive advantage for them to have this implicit guarantee of the'
p75
aS"government because the banks that don't find it more expensive to fund their"
p76
aS'operations, and therefore more difficult to be competitors.'

p89
aS'these big banks were not the cause of the financial crisis. That was Lehman Brothers.'
p90
aS'That was Bear Stearns. That was AIG. Big banks really had nothing to do with it.'
p91
aS'Moreover, the big banks are better capitalized and in much better shape now than they'
p92
aS'were then. And U.S. banks are in better shape than banks anywhere else in the world.'
p93
aS'In a global economy, you need really big banks to serve global companies and to'
p94
aS'compete with the big banks in other countries.'
p95
aS'And then finally, the question of what kind of regulation. I had a chance to ask Tim'
p96
aS'Geithner a question today about bank regulation. And he said, "You know, it\'s a bit like'
p97
aS'Afghanistan. You have all of these different tribes, all these uneasy exercises of power'
p98
aS'and conflict with each other." And, of course, he\'s talking about the incredible'
p99
aS'complexity of financial regulation in this country. And then if you think about, out of a'
p100
aS"process like that, if you're going to hand out a meat ax to whack these big banks, the"

S'Thank you. Thank you very much. When Simon Johnson and I speak of breaking up the'
p324
aS"big banks, we're speaking of less than a dozen banks that are considered, as you"
p325
aS'mentioned, too big to fail. Let me just give you a statistic, 0.2 percent of all the banks'
p326
aS'in the United States of America control 70 percent of the banking assets of the country.'
p327
aS'One of them mentioned earlier by Bob, JPMorgan, has assets that exceed the total'
p328
aS'assets of 5,400 community banks in this country. Our definition of a bank too big to'
p329
aS'fail is a bank whose bond holders and shareholders and managers and big customers,'
p330
aS'even their oligarchs, believe themselves exempt from the rules and the consequences'
p331
aS"that apply to all others. If they screw up they'll be bailed out by you, the people in this"
p332
aS'audience, the American taxpayers. It happened in 2008, 2010. You know that. And'
p333
aS'then a law called Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress to prevent it from ever happening'
p334
aS'again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than'
p335
aS'ever. They are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of'
p336
aS'profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that'
p337
aS'taxpayers will once again come to their rescue. The mechanics to corral them are more'
p338
aS'politicized than ever.'
p339
aS'And even worse, Dodd-Frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks'
p340
aS'with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would'
p341
aS'take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement. This places'
p342
aS'the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive'
p343
aS"disadvantage. They don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well-"
p344
aS'heeled, Brooklyn accented lobbyists like Paul Saltzman to work the regulators.'
p345
aS'Under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial'
p346
aS'institutions. The acronym for that is SIFIs. Now we, at the Dallas Fed and Simon and I'
p347
aS'would consider the SIFI an acronym for save if failure impending. And actually when'
p348
aS'you think about it, SIFI sounds like a communicable disease.'
p349
aS"Something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed --"
p350
aS'Thank you.'
p351
aS'I was waiting for that response. Indeed it was the TBTF or the SIFIs who were, if not the'
p352
aS'cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our'
p353
aS'economy in 2008-2010. That crisis, we estimate at the Dallas Fed, cost the United States'
p354
aS'over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain. And if you do your numbers,'
p355
aS"you'll know that this is $120,000 per every American household. The SIFIs, the too big"
p356
aS'to fail, are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the American economy. They'
p357
aS'threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this'
p358
aS'broadcast. So yes, Simon Johnson and I are advocates for breaking up the big banks that'
p359
aS'are considered too big to fail. Our proposal is simple.'
p360
aS'We suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking'
p361
aS'commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies. We will let'
p362
aS'them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your'
p363
aS'deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from'
p364
aS'underwriting any of their other businesses. Secondly, require anybody who is'
p365
aS'counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to'
p366
aS'sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails -- if this transaction fails, we will'
p367
aS'never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the United States. And, C, subject all those'
p368
aS"businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not"
p369
aS'protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding'
p370
aS"companies enjoy. For example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin"
p371
aS'requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a'
p372
aS'bond.'
p373
aS"And finally, insist on transparency. As Bob pointed out, there's not much transparency."
p374
aS"There's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called. The CEOs of these businesses know where"
p375
aS"their risks are. If you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by"
p376
aS'looking at their balance sheet. And I would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me'
p377
aS"why what I've just suggested is an unworkable solution. And Mr. Saltzman and others"
p378
aS'are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths. One is that there is'
p379
aS'greater banking concentration in Canada than in the United States, greater'
p380
aS"concentration in France than in the United States. That's great if you like Gordon"
p381
aS"Lightfoot, or if you're French."
p382
aS'Or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration,'
p383
aS"for example computers or telecoms, that's true. But these are companies that are not"
p384
aS'shielded from failure like banks are. They receive no subsidies from the implied'
p385
aS'guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the'
p386

S'Thank you, John. Seven years after the subprime mortgage crisis, one thing is clear.'
p421
aS'Many people made serious mistakes; public officials, regulators and, yes, Simon and'
p422
aS'Richard, large banks. Mistakes that we now know with the benefit of hindsight helped'
p423
aS'bring about the crisis. But in the three years since the passage of the Dodd Frank'
p424
aS'Financial Reform Act, there has been an intense focus on strengthening our banking'
p425
aS'system. There are new rules and supervisory practices that are changing both the'
p426
aS'culture and the structure of large banks in permanent and transformational ways to'
p427
aS'ensure that a crisis like the one we experienced never happens again.'
p428
aS'But my opponents ignore or understate these reforms. Instead, they propose a radical,'
p429
aS'untested, and practically unworkable experiment that would upend the progress we'
p430
aS"have made and create a whole host of new systemic crises. My opponents' proposal"
p431
aS'would forcibly break up the largest big banks by placing an arbitrary cap, a government'
p432
aS"imposed -- the same government that can't seem to get its act together with respect to"
p433
aS'the payment of our debt. This unprecedented abuse of government power attempts to'
p434
aS'address an ill-defined risk with little regard for its practical implications or its'
p435
aS'unintended consequences, simply because they think smaller banks are inherently safer.'
p436
aS'That is their underlying assumption. And they are selling you this solution as a risk-free'
p437
aS'proposition without any cost to society. Yes, we can have all the benefits of large banks,'
p438
aS"but we don't need the large banks."
p439
aS"I'm afraid, Simon and Richard, you just can't have it both ways. Their solution is naive"
p440
aS'and nostalgic. Yes, we all yearn for a simpler world. I get it. But when America and the'
p441
aS'world become less interconnected and simpler, when large and small companies'
p442
aS'become less global and stop being the mainstay of production, consumer innovation,'
p443
aS"and choice, then let's have this debate. Look, the strengths of our banking system is its"
p444
aS'diversity. We need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions. And yes, within that mosaic,'
p445
aS'some banks are large, quite large. But some of these banks are large for a simple'
p446
aS'reason. They mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve. They are'
p447
aS'scaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services.'
p448
aS'Large banks provide a unique set of services. Global distribution channels, innovative'
p449
aS'technologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope and'
p450
aS'scale at cheaper prices for American consumers.'
p451
aS'Some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points.'
p452
aS'Some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment for'
p453
aS'our global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems. And large banks'
p454
aS'spend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure from'
p455
aS'dangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay. And some benefits'
p456
aS"are indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like the"
p457
aS'breadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operational'
p458
aS'support and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, trade'
p459
aS'finance, global cash management and other risk management tools. Look, several'
p460
aS"realities will be debated tonight, realities which I submit can't reasonably be refuted,"
p461
aS'although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so.'
p462
aS"First, we do have to put things in perspective. Some of America's banks are indeed"
p463
aS'large. But we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the world'
p464
aS'economy that we live in. The size of the American banking system is proportional to the'
p465
aS'economy that it serves. Our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basically'
p466
aS"the equivalent of South Africa's. In addition, as Richard mentioned -- I know he was"
p467
aS'appealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree of'
p468
aS'concentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries. The'
p469
aS'largest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most other'
p470
aS'industries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals'
p471
aS"and wireless telecom. Second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is that"
p472
aS'smaller banks are somehow safer and less complex.'
p473
aS'That is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history. Banking crises'
p474
aS'are caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you have'
p475
aS"what's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many people"
p476
aS'buying the same overvalued asset. And when that asset bubble bursts, you have a'
p477
aS'systemic crisis. My point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds,'
p478
aS'can be a source of systemic risk. They have been, and unfortunately, they will be.'
p479
aS'Breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis. And also, they would eliminate'
p480
aS'the stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times of'
p481
aS"inevitable crises. And third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during the"
p482
aS"course of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law that"
p483
aS'prohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates too big to fail.'
p484
aS'And there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatory'
p485
aS'reforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system. To ignore or understate these'
p486
aS"transformational changes is disingenuous. There isn't a single aspect of a bank's"
p487
aS"business that hasn't undergone -- been untouched, undergone reform or been"
p488
aS'untouched by regulatory reform. Banks have twice as much capital as they had before'
p489
aS'the crisis. Liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation. Bankruptcy road'
p490
aS'maps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and less complex.'
p491
aS'And we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved without'
p492
aS'taxpayer support. To suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong. They'
p493
aS'are in place. They are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and the'
p494
aS'impact of that failure if and when it does occur.'
p495
aS'The answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bring'
p496
aS'to our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatory'
p497
aS'framework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the next'
p498
aS'crisis is coming from.'

S'Thank you very much. And thank you, Paul and Doug, for being willing to come out and'
p555
aS"argue the big banks' corner this evening. This debate is long overdue. Now, Richard"
p556
aS'Fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking'
p557
aS"up the big banks. And, now, you should take note of what he says. He's the president"
p558
aS"of the Dallas Fed. He's a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets. He's"
p559
aS'also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements'
p560
aS"he makes, wouldn't want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner. My"
p561
aS"job today is to tell you the things that Richard Fisher can't tell you --"
p562
aS"-- because he's too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat. And a lot of these things are"
p563
aS'about politics, and I want to cover these precisely by responding to what Paul Saltzman'
p564
aS'has just said on three main dimensions. I want to talk about the magic -- supposed'
p565
aS'magic of banking.'
p566
aS'I want to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the world. And I want to talk'
p567
aS'about Dodd-Frank, the legislation; the miracle that Mr. Saltzman says has fixed all our'
p568
aS'problems. Now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it? Have you'
p569
aS'seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in customer'
p570
aS'service; the reduction in fees; the better access to credit for all Americans?'
p571
aS'No, no, you have not. You have not.'
p572
aS'And the really --'
p573
aS"-- the really interesting point -- and I'm afraid the sleight of hand, and it's a masterful"
p574
aS'sleight of hand -- in what Mr. Saltzman said is the history. When did the banks in the'
p575
aS"United States become so big? It wasn't 50 years ago. It wasn't 30 years ago. It's mostly"
p576
aS'in the last 15 years.'
p577
aS'Mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the United States had total assets around 15 percent,'
p578
aS"1-5 percent of U.S. GDP. They're now over 60 percent of GDP, combined. They're"
p579
aS'bigger now than they were before the crisis. This is a recent development. All --'
p580
aS'everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the'
p581
aS"magic if there were any magic for you. There isn't. There's magic, all right, there's"
p582
aS'magic in compensation. If you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck. You'
p583
aS"understand what that's about. There is no magic of size for the consumer, for the"
p584
aS'broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector.'
p585
aS"Let's talk about numbers. Let's talk about -- let me talk about JPMorgan Chase. I don't"
p586
aS"see Jamie Dimon the room. He could speak for himself if he is here. We haven't --"
p587
aS'nobody said anything about the numbers, the size. What is the balance sheet -- total'
p588
aS'balance sheet measured properly?'
p589
aS"Include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards. It's a $4"
p590
aS"trillion bank. It's about a quarter the size of the U.S. economy. I'm comparing the"
p591
aS"balance sheet with our annual GDP. That's a big bank."
p592
aS"If JPMorgan were on the verge of failure today, a Wednesday, it's an awkward day for"
p593
aS'banks, though -- I think one of the big lessons actually from the Clearing House'
p594
aS'simulation was "Don\'t fail on a Tuesday."'
p595
aS"It's a long way from Tuesday to the weekend. We need to get to the weekend. Do the"
p596
aS"bailout. Right? It's a Wednesday. It's Wednesday, it's an awkward day, I understand."
p597
aS"It's an awkward day. JPMorgan, $4 trillion is going down. It's a hypothetical. Please"
p598
aS"don't rush to tweet that. It's hypothetical. JPMorgan is about to fail. Who here thinks"
p599
aS'that the president, secretary to the treasury, chairman of the Federal Reserve would let'
p600
aS'them go? Let them fail? Take the hit?'
p601
aS'Go through bankruptcy? Does anyone think JPMorgan could fail just like every other'
p602
aS'business outside of big banks could fail in America? Could JPMorgan fail? Anyone want'
p603
aS'to raise their hand? Paul, you can raise your hand if you want.'
p604
aS'Anyway, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was a $1.1 trillion bank when'
p605
aS"it failed. I'm sorry, was rescued by liquidity loans. I always get those two things mixed"
p606
aS'up.'
p607
aS'In September 2008, $1.1 trillion bank. That was up from $250 billion in the mid-1990s'
p608
aS'when it was one of the best banks in the world, when it provided really good service to'
p609
aS'individuals and corporate customers. One of the best banks in the world. It became a'
p610
aS'lot bigger. It became $1.1 trillion. Anyone think Goldman Sachs could fail. No. I see no'
p611
aS'hands. One hand. Good luck to you, sir.'
p612
aS'There is a short seller in every New York audience.'
p613
aS"Dodd-Frank, Mr. Saltzman says, Dodd-Frank has solved this problem. Now, I'm a"
p614
aS'supporter of Dodd-Frank. I think this is important legislation. We had to get some of'
p615
aS'those reforms done. I worked to help the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,'
p616
aS'with their implementation of some of the plans for how you manage the collapse of'
p617
aS"these banks. Yes, I'm a member of the systemic advisory committee for the FDIC. It's a"
p618
aS'great, fun job. I can assure you. We have terrific parties.'
p619
aS"And, you know, maybe, maybe it'll work. Maybe the single point of entry, the"
p620
aS"recapitalization of the holding company, maybe they'll be enough capital. Maybe the"
p621
aS'Federal Reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes'
p622
aS'the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who'
p623
aS'should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the'
p624
aS'rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on'
p625
aS'everyone who lost a job.'
p626
aS'Eight million jobs lost, $15 trillion in output. Dennis Kelleher from Better Markets in the'
p627
aS'second row has the same numbers from his independent assessment. This is a calamity.'
p628
aS'Maybe we could avert that danger. Maybe Dodd-Frank will work and all these pieces'
p629
aS'will come together. I would not bet on that. I do not advise you to bet on it. I advise'
p630
aS"you not to take risk out of the world. You can't do that. We have no magic bullets."
p631
aS'There are no panaceas, but as a matter of responsible action, as a matter of dealing with'
p632
aS'the problems that confront you, as a matter of reducing the risks that we will face, I'

p661
aS'from my prepared notes here, from the sleight of hand comment. My -- the sleight of'
p662
aS'hand I noticed is they seem to either not be making the same proposal or they seem not'
p663
aS'to be clear on what the proposal is. My understanding was this was about breaking up'
p664
aS'the big banks, which I think most of us here, certainly Paul and I assumed, was to break'
p665
aS'them into pieces, many pieces, not -- to bring them down below a certain size level, not'
p666
aS'to do what sounds like a variant of Glass-Steagall.'
p667
aS"Simon himself didn't describe what he thinks should be done. He described what he"
p668
aS"doesn't like about the current situation. I'm sure later they'll have a chance to explain"
p669
aS'what they actually mean and if they both mean the same thing. Taking this the way I'
p670
aS'think we were supposed to, I strongly believe it would be a big mistake to forcibly break'
p671
aS'up the largest American banks. I oppose breaking them up for three main reasons.'
p672
aS'First, as Paul has pointed out, we need some very large complex banks in America to'
p673
aS'cost effectively help our businesses and families deal with a large, complex world.'
p674
aS'Without them, loans and other services will be more expensive and harder to get.'
p675
aS'Second, breaking up the big banks is unlikely to make us safer, despite the assertions of'
p676
aS'Richard and Simon.'
p677
aS'Third, the process of breaking the banks up would almost certainly cut bank lending for'
p678
aS'a number of years at a time when our economy needs more lending, not less. Starting'
p679
aS'with the role of big banks, I think Paul explained quite well. What we need in America is'
p680
aS'an ecosystem of finance in which there are many different types of organizations that'
p681
aS'are thriving; big banks, small banks, insurance companies, many other types of'
p682
aS'participants. Among those I submit that we do need some very large banks, primarily to'
p683
aS'serve our largest companies, and even middle sized companies, that need a very wide'
p684
aS'range of financial services, need them in many locations, including overseas, and need'
p685
aS"them to be provided at a scale that allows it to be cost effective so they're not"
p686
aS'excessively priced.'
p687
aS'This means, when you add this up, we do need some that are quite large. And I would'
p688
aS'think if they have a criterion, would cross the criterion that they -- my opponents would'
p689
aS"feel -- meant they should be broken up. And this isn't just my opinion. The Business"
p690
aS'Roundtable did a survey of CEOs of major U.S. companies, and they very strongly'
p691
aS'supported the need for banks of this nature. Now, Richard has his Federal Reserve Bank'
p692
aS"in Dallas, which does some nice research for him. But I'm sorry, Richard, I happen to be"
p693
aS'more impressed by research papers from two other Federal Reserve banks in St. Louis'
p694
aS'and in Philadelphia, that have shown quite considerable benefits of this kind of size and'
p695
aS'scope to quite large levels, that these provide many benefits to society to allow the'
p696
aS'services to be provided at a reasonable cost without which loans and other services'
p697
aS'would become more expensive.'
p698
aS"I also wouldn't want to see us tie our hands in international competition. Now, let me"
p699
aS"go to my point on no increase in safety, because I don't actually believe that what"
p700
aS"they're describing would make us safer, even though perhaps in that Churchillian"
p701
aS'approach, it sounds agreeable to do this, to break up the big banks -- we all seem to'
p702
aS"hate bankers -- but it's not actually the right way to go. Now, think about why it -- what"
p703
aS"would be different. Let's say ten years ago, if we had broken up the big banks into 20"
p704
aS"pieces each, I don't think much would have been different in the crisis that we had. It"
p705
aS"would have been severe, it would have happened, and the character wouldn't have"
p706
aS'been that much different, because these smaller banks that they were broken up into'
p707
aS'would all have gone the same way, that is, they all would have overinvested in'
p708
aS'mortgages, both residential and commercial.'
p709
aS'Now, why do I say that? One, because at the time, almost everybody thought this was'
p710
aS'smart business. So almost all the players in the financial sector were doing it. Secondly,'
p711
aS'you can look at what small and medium sized banks did. The ones who actually existed'
p712
aS'that are supposed by safer, they took on tremendous risk and got hurt quite badly.'
p713
aS"They were just smaller, so they didn't, each one of them, make the headlines. Smaller"
p714
aS'size was no protection from risky and ultimately stupid decisions. Richard and Simon'
p715
aS"imply that smaller banks will take less risk. I don't see it. I don't see it from the"
p716
aS"incentive structure, and I don't see it from how they actually operated. Put another"
p717
aS'way, breaking up the big banks would not have affected any of the principal factors that'
p718
aS'analysts tend to argue caused the financial crisis.'
p719
aS"They wouldn't have affected excessive investment in all types of mortgages, reduced"
p720
aS'standards for those mortgages, government pressure and encouragement to make risky'
p721
aS'mortgage loans, lacks regulation, poor practices at the rating agencies, a bad bonus'
p722
aS'culture, excessive risk taking by some individuals and the incentives that existed to'
p723
aS"create dodgy securitizations. So I don't see why we'd expect it to be safer. Now, you"
p724
aS"might say, well, we wouldn't have to do a rescue as taxpayers if these were smaller"
p725
aS'banks. But we saw, in the savings and loan crisis -- -- that we had to do that. If I had'
p726
aS'more time, I would talk more about this. But you may be surprised that Paul Krugman,'
p727
aS'no friend of the banks, agrees with us. He said, "Breaking up big banks wouldn\'t really'
p728
aS"solve our problems, because it's perfectly possible to have a financial crisis that mainly"
p729
aS'takes the form of a run on smaller banks."'
p730
aS"In fact, that's precisely what happened in the 1930s. And if I had more time, I'd give you"
p731
aS'the rest of the quote. I can do that later if you want.'
p732
aS'But let me move on to the conclusion here. Keep in mind, Richard and Simon are selling'
p733
aS'you a theory. We have no actual experience of breaking up the big banks in this way in'
p734
aS'advanced economies. They cannot promise success. And I personally believe it will do'
p735
aS"considerable harm. The economy will be less efficient, credit more expensive. We'll be"
p736
aS"less competitive globally, and I don't see an increase in overall safety. Thank you."

p761
aS'two arguing for and against the motion, "Break up the Big Banks." Arguing for breaking'
p762
aS"up the big banks, Richard Fisher and Simon Johnson who are arguing that we're in"
p763
aS'uncharted territory in terms of the size of the small number of banks that control the'
p764
aS"assets of an enormous amounts of money that they didn't have 15 years ago; that the"
p765
aS'government protections that allow them to operate without fear of failure, without'
p766
aS'bailout represents a moral hazard; the fact that they are shielded from failure is a moral'
p767
aS'hazard that needs to be remedied. The team arguing against the motion, Doug Elliott'
p768
aS'and Paul Saltzman argue that the bigness of the banks is not the key issue here, that in'
p769
aS'the financial crisis we all went through a few years ago, there were many, many factors'
p770
aS'involved.'
p771
aS'And big banks, while they made mistakes, were only part of that problem, that breaking'
p772
aS'up the banks, these big banks would be a dangerous and unworkable experiment, and'
p773
aS'that basically big business needs big banks. And if we want to be global, we have to'

aS"That's, in fact, the core of their argument is that there are banks that are too big to"

p2771
aS'economy in which we live.'
p2772
aS"Unlike any era before, we live in a global economy. It's clear that our economy requires"
p2773
aS'these international banks to support customers. The only question is whether America'
p2774
aS"will sit on the sidelines or be part of that. Today, just four of the world's largest 25"
p2775
aS'banks are American banks. To break them up and reduce that number to zero'
p2776
aS"jeopardizes America's leadership in the world and America's global leadership. We need"
p2777
aS'solutions that move the financial system forward, not backward. I ask that you keep in'
p2778
aS"mind that we can't roll back the clock. I know it's natural after the kind of disaster that"
p2779
aS"we faced and the turmoil that we've all experienced to yearn for simpler, less complex"
p2780
aS'times, but the American economy that was once served exclusively by small banks just'
p2781
aS"no longer exists. The good old days weren't that good. The S&L crisis, the Great"
p2782
aS'Depression, all were caused by systemic risks associated with smaller banks.'
p2783
aS"Rolling back the clock to restructure the banking system isn't realistic, and it simply"
p2784
aS"wouldn't make us safer. I ask you to support Dodd-Frank, the macro-prudential reforms"
p2785
aS'that are making it less likely for banks to fail. In closing, I know it feels good, but I'

aS"question. Let me repeat what Paul said. The overall objectives you've described,"

p2839
aS"First is I'm still a little unclear exactly what it is and how it relates to the actual thing we"
p2840
aS"were supposed to debate, and for me that's an important point, but beyond that --"
p2841
aS'-- beyond that, I do believe that from the years of experience I had working in the'
p2842
aS'industry that the customers really have seen major advantages. A lot of the growth has'
p2843
aS'been customer driven, and I do want to say, Richard, early on you were describing'
p2844
aS'bankers who were deliberately creating excessively large firms for the sake of being'
p2845
aS'excessively large, opaque firms for the sake of maximizing the subsidies. I worked in'
p2846
aS'M&A in finance working with financial institutions. I never once in the 20 years ever'
p2847
aS'talked to anybody who, even in private conversations, had any of those things as their'

aS'objectives.'
p2849
aS'Now I can understand if you want to make the argument that the incentive structure'
p2850
aS'pushes things that way, but I would strongly urge backing away from language that both'
p2851
aS'of you at times have used that argues that the bankers are deliberately trying to create'
p2852
aS"their firms in such a way that they get these subsidies. I think I'll leave it there. I'd urge"

aS'Northern Securities. A very large railroad company in the northwest part of the United'

aS'States.'
p2876
aS'It was one of the first actions of its kind. It was extremely controversial. A lot of people'
p2877
aS"in the mainstream didn't know what Roosevelt was doing. There were plenty of"
p2878
aS'arguments made that these monopolies were modern, they were efficient. They would'
p2879
aS'benefit the American economy. J.P. Morgan, the original J.P. Morgan, the man, came to'
p2880
aS'the White House in February 1902. And he said to Roosevelt and to his attorney'
p2881
aS'general, "If we\'ve done anything wrong, send your man to see my man, and we\'ll fix it'
p2882
aS'up." And Roosevelt and his attorney general, thank goodness, said no. We don\'t want'
p2883
aS"to fix it up. We want to stop it. This, in Roosevelt's mind, was an excessive"
p2884
aS'concentration of power. It was dangerous to the democracy. They took that case all the'
p2885
aS'way to the Supreme Court.'
p2886
aS'They won it 4 to 3. And out of that came a lot more precedents, antitrust cases, more'
p2887
aS'legislation and, I would submit, the really important change was a shift in the consensus,'
p2888
aS"people like you in New York in 1902 didn't know what Roosevelt was doing or why it"
p2889
aS"made sense. They thought, many of them, it'd be bad for business. In 1911, when the"

aS'government moved to break up Standard Oil, there were very few defenders of huge'
