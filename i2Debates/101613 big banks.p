p439
aS'It happened in 2008, 2010.'
p440
aS'You know that.'
p441
aS'And then a law called Dodd-Frank was passed by Congress to prevent it from ever happening again, and yet today these banks are bigger and the power more concentrated than ever.'
p442
aS'They are just as likely, they may even be more likely to take great risks in search of profits protected by the assumption that failure is an unlikely outcome and that taxpayers will once again come to their rescue.'
p443
aS'The mechanics to corral them are more politicized than ever.'
p444
aS'And even worse, Dodd-Frank, the legislation we just referred to, shackled smaller banks with over 13,000 pages of rules and regulations that as of last year we estimated would take 24,180,156 hours every single year to comply with and to implement.'
p445
aS'This places the smaller banks that wish to compete with the big banks at a tremendous competitive disadvantage.'
p446
aS"They don't have the resources to hire lawyers and handsome, well- heeled, Brooklyn accented lobbyists like Paul Saltzman to work the regulators."
p447
aS'Under the law, the big banks are now designated as systemically important financial institutions.'
p448
aS'The acronym for that is SIFIs.'
p449
aS'Now we, at the Dallas Fed and Simon and I would consider the SIFI an acronym for save if failure impending.'
p450
aS'And actually when you think about it, SIFI sounds like a communicable disease.'
p451
aS"Something that's transmitted by risky behavior and indeed -- Thank you."
p452
aS'I was waiting for that response.'
p453
aS'Indeed it was the TBTF or the SIFIs who were, if not the cause of, they were the spreaders of the economic virus that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008-2010.'
p454
aS'That crisis, we estimate at the Dallas Fed, cost the United States over $15 trillion in output, output we have yet to regain.'
p455
aS"And if you do your numbers, you'll know that this is $120,000 per every American household."
p456
aS'The SIFIs, the too big to fail, are a dagger pointed directly at the heart of the American economy.'
p457
aS'They threaten the well-being of everybody in in audience and everybody listening to this broadcast.'
p458
aS'So yes, Simon Johnson and I are advocates for breaking up the big banks that are considered too big to fail.'
p459
aS'Our proposal is simple.'
p460
aS'We suggest that we limit any and all government guarantees to deposit-taking commercial banking operations of these large bank holding companies.'
p461
aS'We will let them operate their other businesses, but first prevent them by law from using your deposits and the governed guarantees for the safety of those guarantees from underwriting any of their other businesses.'
p462
aS'Secondly, require anybody who is counterparty to their other business, which contracts with them on a risk transaction to sign a simple declaration that if this declaration fails -- if this transaction fails, we will never, ever be bailed out by the taxpayers of the United States.'
p463
aS"And, C, subject all those businesses to the regulations that such businesses are subject to when they're not protected by the banking laws that we currently have, that these big bank holding companies enjoy."
p464
aS"For example, on derivatives, make sure they're subject to margin requirements, just like individuals are when they borrow money to buy a stock or a bond."
p465
aS'And finally, insist on transparency.'
p466
aS"As Bob pointed out, there's not much transparency."
p467
aS"There's a lot of opaqueness, as it's called."
p468
aS'The CEOs of these businesses know where their risks are.'
p469
aS"If you're a sophisticated analyst, there's no way to determine that by looking at their balance sheet."
p470
aS"And I would actually defy our noble opponents to tell me why what I've just suggested is an unworkable solution."
p471
aS'And Mr. Saltzman and others are very fond of pointing out what they consider to be myths.'
p472
aS'One is that there is greater banking concentration in Canada than in the United States, greater concentration in France than in the United States.'
p473
aS"That's great if you like Gordon Lightfoot, or if you're French."
p474
aS"Or they will point out that there are other industries that have a greater concentration, for example computers or telecoms, that's true."
p475
aS'But these are companies that are not shielded from failure like banks are.'
p476
aS'They receive no subsidies from the implied guarantees that the government currently provides them, currently provides the bankers to shield them from failure.'
p477
aS'Winston Churchill once said that in finance everything that is agreeable is unsound, and everything that is sound is disagreeable.'
p478
aS'I know that what Simon Johnson and I propose is disagreeable to the highly paid lobbyists and spokesmen of the too big to fail big banks.'
p479
aS'But it is the sound thing to do.'
p480
aS'The big banks, in summary, have taken what I call the immoral high ground.'
p481
aS'Government policy has led them there, and it has enshrined them.'
p482
aS'We need to correct this perversion of American capitalism.'
p483
aS"It may not be the French thing to do, but it's the American thing to do, and I think we should do so."

p575
aS'Yes, we all yearn for a simpler world.'
p576
aS'I get it.'
p577

p578
aS'Look, the strengths of our banking system is itsdiversity.'
p579
aS'We need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions.'
p580
aS'And yes, within that mosaic,some banks are large, quite large.'
p581
aS'But some of these banks are large for a simplereason.'
p582
aS'They mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve.'
p583
aS'They arescaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services.Large banks provide a unique set of services.'
p584
aS'Global distribution channels, innovativetechnologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope andscale at cheaper prices for American consumers.Some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points.Some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment forour global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems.'
p585
aS'And large banksspend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure fromdangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay.'
p586
aS"And some benefitsare indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like thebreadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operationalsupport and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, tradefinance, global cash management and other risk management tools."
p587
aS"Look, severalrealities will be debated tonight, realities which I submit can't reasonably be refuted,although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so.First, we do have to put things in perspective."
p588
aS"Some of America's banks are indeedlarge."
p589
aS'But we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the worldeconomy that we live in.'
p590
aS'The size of the American banking system is proportional to theeconomy that it serves.'
p591
aS"Our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basicallythe equivalent of South Africa's."
p592
aS'In addition, as Richard mentioned -- I know he wasappealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree ofconcentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries.'
p593
aS'Thelargest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most otherindustries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticalsand wireless telecom.'
p594
aS"Second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is thatsmaller banks are somehow safer and less complex.That is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history."
p595
aS"Banking crisesare caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you havewhat's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many peoplebuying the same overvalued asset."
p596
aS'And when that asset bubble bursts, you have asystemic crisis.'
p597
aS'My point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds,can be a source of systemic risk.'
p598
aS'They have been, and unfortunately, they will be.Breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis.'
p599
aS'And also, they would eliminatethe stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times ofinevitable crises.'
p600
aS"And third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during thecourse of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law thatprohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates too big to fail.And there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatoryreforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system."
p601
aS'To ignore or understate thesetransformational changes is disingenuous.'
p602
aS"There isn't a single aspect of a bank'sbusiness that hasn't undergone -- been untouched, undergone reform or beenuntouched by regulatory reform."

aS'Banks have twice as much capital as they had beforethe crisis.'
p604
aS'Liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation.'
p605
aS'Bankruptcy roadmaps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and less complex.And we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved withouttaxpayer support.'
p606
aS'To suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong.'
p607
aS'Theyare in place.'
p608
aS'They are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and theimpact of that failure if and when it does occur.The answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bringto our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatoryframework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the nextcrisis is coming from.'

aS"But when America and the world become less interconnected and simpler, when large and small companies become less global and stop being the mainstay of production, consumer innovation, and choice, then let's have this debate."
p633
aS'Look, the strengths of our banking system is its diversity.'
p634
aS'We need banks of all sizes, shapes and functions.'
p635
aS'And yes, within that mosaic, some banks are large, quite large.'
p636
aS'But some of these banks are large for a simple reason.'
p637
aS'They mirror the size and the scope of the economy that they serve.'
p638
aS'They are scaled to serve the customers and the companies that voluntarily use their services.'
p639
aS'Large banks provide a unique set of services.'
p640
aS'Global distribution channels, innovative technologies that only they can produce because of the economies of size, scope and scale at cheaper prices for American consumers.'
p641
aS'Some of these benefits are visible, like mobile payment technologies and reward points.'
p642
aS'Some are very much behind the scenes like fraud protection and massive investment for our global infrastructure, clearance, settlement and payment systems.'
p643
aS'And large banks spend tens of billions of dollars protecting this critical market infrastructure from dangerous cyber-attacks that small banks could not afford to pay.'
p644
aS"And some benefits are indeed difficult to quantify, but that doesn't make them any less valuable, like the breadth of services that they provide to smaller banks as correspondents as operational support and corporations large and small that allow for multicurrency channels, trade finance, global cash management and other risk management tools."
p645
aS"Look, several realities will be debated tonight, realities which I submit can't reasonably be refuted, although my worthy opponents certainly will attempt to do so."
p646
aS'First, we do have to put things in perspective.'
p647
aS"Some of America's banks are indeed large."
p648
aS'But we have to view them relative to the size of our economy and the world economy that we live in.'
p649
aS'The size of the American banking system is proportional to the economy that it serves.'
p650
aS"Our banking system as a percentage of our economy is basically the equivalent of South Africa's."
p651
aS'In addition, as Richard mentioned -- I know he was appealing to isolationist tendencies there, but the fact of the matter is the degree of concentration in our banking system is in fact less than most developed countries.'
p652
aS'The largest banks, as a percentage of industry revenue, are in fact less than most other industries with fixed costs, including auto manufacturing computers, pharmaceuticals and wireless telecom.'
p653
aS"Second, the underlying premise of my opponents' theory is that smaller banks are somehow safer and less complex."
p654
aS'That is a faulty assumption that is simply belied by the facts of history.'
p655
aS"Banking crises are caused by one thing: when too many people buy an overinflated asset, you have what's called a common shock, a common shock associated with too many people buying the same overvalued asset."
p656
aS'And when that asset bubble bursts, you have a systemic crisis.'
p657
aS'My point is, smaller institutions, whether they are banks or hedge funds, can be a source of systemic risk.'
p658
aS'They have been, and unfortunately, they will be.'
p659
aS'Breaking up the banks will not prevent a future crisis.'
p660
aS'And also, they would eliminate the stabilizing impact that large and well diversified banks have during times of inevitable crises.'
p661
aS"And third, and perhaps an area that we'd love to mix it up during the course of the debate, new laws are in place that weren't in place, including the law that prohibits taxpayer bailouts and eliminates too big to fail."
p662
aS'And there has been tremendous progress in the pace and substance of regulatory reforms to mitigate the risks to our banking system.'
p663
aS'To ignore or understate these transformational changes is disingenuous.'
p664
aS"There isn't a single aspect of a bank's business that hasn't undergone -- been untouched, undergone reform or been untouched by regulatory reform."
p665
aS'Banks have twice as much capital as they had before the crisis.'
p666
aS'Liquidity gaps are closed even in advance of regulation.'
p667
aS'Bankruptcy road maps, through living wills are in place that make organizations simpler and less complex.'
p668
aS'And we have a new bankruptcy process that requires banks to be resolved without taxpayer support.'
p669
aS'To suggest that these changes are illusory is just simply wrong.'
p670
aS'They are in place.'
p671
aS'They are effectively limiting both the likelihood the large banks fail and the impact of that failure if and when it does occur.'
p672
aS'The answer presented by these risks is not to ignore the benefits that large banks bring to our society, but to continue to focus on improving the macro-prudential regulatory framework, to periodically assess their effectiveness, and to think about where the next crisis is coming from.'

p737
aS'This debate is long overdue.'
p738
aS'Now, Richard Fisher has laid out for you the case, the economic case, the technical case for breaking up the big banks.'
p739
aS'And, now, you should take note of what he says.'
p740
aS"He's the president of the Dallas Fed."
p741
aS"He's a man with a great deal of experience in financial markets."
p742
aS"He's also a man who has to be, you understand, somewhat careful about certain statements he makes, wouldn't want to move the dollar or anything in a precipitous manner."
p743
aS"My job today is to tell you the things that Richard Fisher can't tell you -- -- because he's too nice a guy and too much of a diplomat."
p744
aS'And a lot of these things are about politics, and I want to cover these precisely by responding to what Paul Saltzman has just said on three main dimensions.'
p745
aS'I want to talk about the magic -- supposed magic of banking.'
p746
aS'I want to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the world.'
p747
aS'And I want to talk about Dodd-Frank, the legislation; the miracle that Mr. Saltzman says has fixed all our problems.'
p748
aS'Now, on the first one, on the magic of big banks, have you felt it?'
p749
aS'Have you seen around you as the banks became bigger the great improvement in customer service; the reduction in fees; the better access to credit for all Americans?'
p750
aS'No, no, you have not.'
p751
aS'You have not.'
p752
aS"And the really -- -- the really interesting point -- and I'm afraid the sleight of hand, and it's a masterful sleight of hand -- in what Mr. Saltzman said is the history."
p753
aS'When did the banks in the United States become so big?'
p754
aS"It wasn't 50 years ago."
p755
aS"It wasn't 30 years ago."
p756
aS"It's mostly in the last 15 years."
p757
aS'Mid-1990s, the largest six banks in the United States had total assets around 15 percent, 1-5 percent of U.S. GDP.'
p758
aS"They're now over 60 percent of GDP, combined."
p759
aS"They're bigger now than they were before the crisis."
p760
aS'This is a recent development.'
p761
aS'All -- everyone in this room, everyone listening and watching at home should have felt the magic if there were any magic for you.'
p762
aS"There isn't."
p763
aS"There's magic, all right, there's magic in compensation."
p764
aS'If you run a bigger bank, you get a bigger paycheck.'
p765
aS"You understand what that's about."
p766
aS'There is no magic of size for the consumer, for the broader economy, for the nonfinancial sector.'
p767
aS"Let's talk about numbers."
p768
aS"Let's talk about -- let me talk about JPMorgan Chase."
p769
aS"I don't see Jamie Dimon the room."
p770
aS'He could speak for himself if he is here.'
p771
aS"We haven't -- nobody said anything about the numbers, the size."
p772
aS'What is the balance sheet -- total balance sheet measured properly?'
p773
aS'Include all the derivative exposure using international accounting standards.'
p774
aS"It's a $4 trillion bank."
p775
aS"It's about a quarter the size of the U.S. economy."
p776
aS"I'm comparing the balance sheet with our annual GDP."
p777
aS"That's a big bank."
p778
aS'If JPMorgan were on the verge of failure today, a Wednesday, it\'s an awkward day for banks, though -- I think one of the big lessons actually from the Clearing House simulation was "Don\'t fail on a Tuesday.'

aS'Maybe the Federal Reserve will insist on preparing these banks properly so when the day comes the damage is more to the management who are responsible and to the creditors who should be on the hook, and to their shareholders who took the risk rather than on the rest of us, rather than on the economy, rather than on the taxpayer, rather than on everyone who lost a job.'

p962
aS'My -- the sleight ofhand I noticed is they seem to either not be making the same proposal or they seem notto be clear on what the proposal is.'
p963
aS"My understanding was this was about breaking upthe big banks, which I think most of us here, certainly Paul and I assumed, was to breakthem into pieces, many pieces, not -- to bring them down below a certain size level, notto do what sounds like a variant of Glass-Steagall.Simon himself didn't describe what he thinks should be done."
p964
aS"He described what hedoesn't like about the current situation."
p965
aS"I'm sure later they'll have a chance to explainwhat they actually mean and if they both mean the same thing."
p966
aS'Taking this the way Ithink we were supposed to, I strongly believe it would be a big mistake to forcibly breakup the largest American banks.'
p967
aS'I oppose breaking them up for three main reasons.First, as Paul has pointed out, we need some very large complex banks in America tocost effectively help our businesses and families deal with a large, complex world.Without them, loans and other services will be more expensive and harder to get.Second, breaking up the big banks is unlikely to make us safer, despite the assertions ofRichard and Simon.Third, the process of breaking the banks up would almost certainly cut bank lending fora number of years at a time when our economy needs more lending, not less.'
p968
aS'Startingwith the role of big banks, I think Paul explained quite well.'
p969
aS'What we need in America isan ecosystem of finance in which there are many different types of organizations thatare thriving; big banks, small banks, insurance companies, many other types ofparticipants.'
p970
aS"Among those I submit that we do need some very large banks, primarily toserve our largest companies, and even middle sized companies, that need a very widerange of financial services, need them in many locations, including overseas, and needthem to be provided at a scale that allows it to be cost effective so they're notexcessively priced.This means, when you add this up, we do need some that are quite large."
p971
aS'And I wouldthink if they have a criterion, would cross the criterion that they -- my opponents wouldfeel -- meant they should be broken up.'
p972
aS"And this isn't just my opinion."
p973
aS'The BusinessRoundtable did a survey of CEOs of major U.S. companies, and they very stronglysupported the need for banks of this nature.'
p974
aS'Now, Richard has his Federal Reserve Bankin Dallas, which does some nice research for him.'
p975
aS"But I'm sorry, Richard, I happen to bemore impressed by research papers from two other Federal Reserve banks in St. Louisand in Philadelphia, that have shown quite considerable benefits of this kind of size andscope to quite large levels, that these provide many benefits to society to allow theservices to be provided at a reasonable cost without which loans and other serviceswould become more expensive.I also wouldn't want to see us tie our hands in international competition."
p976
aS"Now, let mego to my point on no increase in safety, because I don't actually believe that whatthey're describing would make us safer, even though perhaps in that Churchillianapproach, it sounds agreeable to do this, to break up the big banks -- we all seem tohate bankers -- but it's not actually the right way to go."
p977
aS'Now, think about why it -- whatwould be different.'
p978
aS"Let's say ten years ago, if we had broken up the big banks into 20pieces each, I don't think much would have been different in the crisis that we had."
p979
aS"Itwould have been severe, it would have happened, and the character wouldn't havebeen that much different, because these smaller banks that they were broken up intowould all have gone the same way, that is, they all would have overinvested inmortgages, both residential and commercial.Now, why do I say that?"
p980
aS'One, because at the time, almost everybody thought this wassmart business.'
p981
aS'So almost all the players in the financial sector were doing it.'
p982
aS'Secondly,you can look at what small and medium sized banks did.'
p983
aS"The ones who actually existedthat are supposed by safer, they took on tremendous risk and got hurt quite badly.They were just smaller, so they didn't, each one of them, make the headlines."
p984
aS'Smallersize was no protection from risky and ultimately stupid decisions.'
p985
aS'Richard and Simonimply that smaller banks will take less risk.'
p986
aS"I don't see it."
p987
aS"I don't see it from theincentive structure, and I don't see it from how they actually operated."
p988
aS"Put anotherway, breaking up the big banks would not have affected any of the principal factors thatanalysts tend to argue caused the financial crisis.They wouldn't have affected excessive investment in all types of mortgages, reducedstandards for those mortgages, government pressure and encouragement to make riskymortgage loans, lacks regulation, poor practices at the rating agencies, a bad bonusculture, excessive risk taking by some individuals and the incentives that existed tocreate dodgy securitizations."
p989
aS"So I don't see why we'd expect it to be safer."
p990
aS"Now, youmight say, well, we wouldn't have to do a rescue as taxpayers if these were smallerbanks."
p991
aS'But we saw, in the savings and loan crisis -- -- that we had to do that.'

aS'If I hadmore time, I would talk more about this.'

aS'But you may be surprised that Paul Krugman,no friend of the banks, agrees with us.'
