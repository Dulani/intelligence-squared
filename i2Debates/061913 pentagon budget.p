S'Thank you, John.'
p438
aS"And behalf of my partner, Tom Donnelly, I'd also like to thank compliment our worthy adversaries, without whom we could not have a debate here tonight."
p439
aS'Tom and I, in terms of this proposition, believe that further cuts in our defenses will encourage our adversaries, and at the same time, increase the risks to our security, our economic well-being, and the security and economic well-being of our allies and partners around the world.'
p440
aS"In terms of the overall perspective -- but let's take a look at the big view."
p441
aS'At the end of the Cold War, 20 years ago, we were spending, on average, 6 percent of our GDP every year on our defenses.'
p442
aS'Six percent.'
p443
aS'Okay?'
p444
aS"In the span of 20 years, this year, we're down to three percent of our GDP being spent on defense."
p445
aS'So we have cut in half the amount of our national wealth that we have devoted to our defenses, okay?'
p446
aS"I don't think you can find another major part of the federal budget where you have this kind of cut."
p447
aS"So, that's point number one."
p448
aS'Point number two is if you look at the defense budget, you see several, I think, important things.'
p449
aS'One is 30 days ago this year, we decided -- we made a social choice, to adopt a volunteer military.'
p450
aS'And we never really fully paid the price of that choice until after 9/11, when we engaged in a protracted conflict in Afghanistan and then in Iraq.'
p451
aS"In order to recruit and retain sufficient members of -- service members to conduct those operations, we've had to increase personnel spending by over 50 percent, after inflation, since 9/11."
p452
aS"So that's a dramatic increase."
p453
aS'On top of that, the Obama Administration has set forth a revised defense plan which looks to cut nearly half a trillion dollars out of our defenses over the next 10 years.'
p454
aS'So what do you get?'
p455
aS'You get a shrinking defense pie, number one.'
p456
aS'Number two, within that shrinking pie, you get an expanded slice for personnel costs.'
p457
aS'What does that mean?'
p458
aS"That means in the coming years, we're going to see a lot less funding for training, a lot less funding for maintaining our equipment, and a lot less money for replacing all the worn out equipment."
p459
aS"I've been to this movie before."
p460
aS'This is the equation for a hollow military.'
p461
aS'This is the equation for a military that gradually loses its effectiveness and capability.'
p462
aS'Now, how will our enemies react to this?'
p463
aS'Is this a gift to them?'
p464
aS"I don't know."
p465
aS"I'm not -- I'm not privy to their thoughts."
p466
aS'What I can tell you is that the silence is deafening.'
p467
aS"And as Napoleon once said, When your enemy is in the middle of making a great mistake, don't interrupt them."
p468
aS'And again -- so you have this particular situation.'
p469
aS'Now, some people say, Well, gee.'
p470
aS"We're pulling out of Afghanistan."
p471
aS"We're out of Iraq."
p472
aS"Let's reduce defense spending."
p473
aS'After all, the threat is diminishing.'
p474
aS'Well, first of all, our operations in those conflicts were funded by something called OCOB, the Overseas Contingency Operation Budget.'
p475
aS'And those budgets are coming down and will go down to zero.'
p476
aS'But the base defense budget --- typically, when you draw down that budget, that is when the threat is declining.'
p477
aS"And as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we're in a situation right now where the threat is not declining."
p478
aS"He had a pretty good short list, but there's a longer list we can go through."
p479
aS'John mentioned that we brought together four think tanks, from the moderate liberal to the moderate conservative, a few weeks ago to look at the sequestration cuts.'
p480
aS"And these are cuts -- let's -- hey, let's cut another half trillion dollars out of defense over the next decade."
p481
aS"Despite the fact that there's a fair part of the political spectrum that was covered, there are two conclusions that the four think tanks agreed upon: The first is that cuts of the magnitude that are discussed and put forth in sequestration will be a disaster in terms of our military readiness and capability."
p482
aS'Second, there is a belief -- again all four think tanks -- belief that the dangers to our security, the dangers to our economic well-being are increasing over time.'
p483
aS"We've cut our budget since the end of World War II in the past, it's been when the threat's been declining, not when the threat's been increasing."
p484
aS'So to sum up, those who advocate further cuts to our defenses as a way to put the fear of God into our enemies, kind of remind me of what the duke of Wellington once said about his own troops.'
p485
aS'He said, "I don\'t know if they scare the enemies, but by God, these people scare the hell out of me.'

p564
aS"That's one of my more impressive achievements."
p565
aS'I think if we cut the Pentagon budget to zero, sure, that would be a gift.'
p566
aS'But the cuts that are on offer in our political system are a different story.'
p567
aS"The president right now wants to spend roughly $550 billion on defense, including -- that's national defense, budget function 050."
p568
aS"That doesn't include the wars."
p569
aS"Under sequestration, under the cap that we have in place for this coming fiscal year, that'd have to come down about 50 billion."
p570
aS"And over the decade, we'd spend 4.8 trillion on defense instead of 5.3 trillion."
p571
aS"We'd still account for over 40 percent of global military spending and spend more than we did at most points during the Cold War in real terms."
p572
aS"GDP measures -- the percentage of GDP measures what percentage of wealth we're spending."
p573
aS"But, of course, our economy's been growing that whole time."
p574
aS"We spend -- we're seven times wealthier than we were in 1950 or something like that."
p575
aS"So if that amount of spending is a gift to our enemies, it's sort of a crappy first night of Hanukkah type gift, like sweat socks or toothpaste."
p576
aS'I think our enemies are too far behind for it to matter much.'
p577
aS"They're sort of small potatoes, historically speaking, especially when you consider our wealth, our technological prowess, and our geographic advantage; these oceans around us and our weak and peaceful neighbors."
p578
aS'Our biggest threat right now, according to pretty much everyone, is a scattered and increasingly pathetic remnant of the al-Qaeda terrorist movement thats failed to do much since 2001 except scare us into terrorizing ourselves.'
p579
aS"And even if you don't buy that take, you ought to recognize that aggressive counterterrorism operations with drones, with special operations forces, intelligence galore requires only a tiny fraction of our military budget."
p580
aS"And our state enemies, North Korea, Iran, Syria, they're brutal regimes that pose little threat here."
p581
aS'They lack the capacity to conquer their neighbors, let alone come over here and harm us.'
p582
aS"Russia, if you want to consider that an enemy, of course, has a lot of nuclear weapons, but with a dwindling population, a rusty conventional military dependent on an economy that's about equal to the Iberian Peninsula's, its days of threatening Western Europe are long gone, whatever we do."
p583
aS'Now, China is a bigger issue.'
p584
aS"I'm sure it will come up a bunch here."
p585
aS'But they spend about a third of what we do on defense, on the military.'
p586
aS'And most of that goes to ground forces that are largely irrelevant to a naval and air war that we might have with them if we had any war.'
p587
aS'We have 11 carriers.'
p588
aS'They have one that they practice on.'
p589
aS'Their much heralded anti-ship, ballistic missile capability which is supposed to be a threat to our ships, at the moment remains quite vulnerable to various countermeasures that we have.'
p590
aS'And I think maintaining that edge is not a problem of absolute resources.'
p591
aS"More important, China's a trading partner, not a real enemy, that we have no good reason to threaten unless were eager to fight a war over disputed Pacific rocks which we're not."
p592
aS"I think we should hedge against China's rise not by surrounding it with our forces, which likely encourages its military buildup, but by staying rich and avoiding debt and keeping a technological edge to allow a buildup later if need be."
p593
aS"I think the real question, when it comes to military spending is what's best not for our enemies, or worse for our enemies, but what's best for us."
p594
aS'And I think what we want is the cheapest possible military that can defend our shores, that can keep trade routes open in times of duress.'
p595
aS'And fulfill the balancing function, that long guided British and then U.S. military policy for a long time.'
p596
aS'It is to prevent a big rival from emerging overseas that can conquer our friends and threaten us.'
p597
aS'And I think we can do that quite easily with very little overseas military presence right now.'
p598
aS'What the other side wants from our military is global dominance, which I think is not really possible.'
p599
aS"They'll say that current or greater spending is necessary to our military strategy which is primacy, which is to be a sort of globe girdling policeman."
p600
aS'And that strategy is necessary to global stability.'
p601
aS'And I think both parts of that statement are wrong.'
p602
aS'First, we could do essentially what we do in the world now in terms of our alliances, naval patrols, bases, at a substantially cheaper cost.'
p603
aS'I think you could trim at least 50 billion off the defense budget and do all the stuff we do now.'
p604
aS"I can't explain the details of how you get there, but a good place to start, if you're interested, is Dr. Krepinevich's Foreign Affairs article from I think it was February this year that says we'll shift a bunch of money out of the army into the Navy."
p605
aS"I think that's a good idea."
p606
aS'I think you could also look at the joint letter that those -- a number of think tanks signed on to that had a bunch of efficiency savings, including another round and personnel cost reform.'
p607
aS"We're not destined to spend what we do right now on personnel."
p608
aS'And both my opponents signed that letter.'
p609
aS"Second, global peace and trade I think would be fine if we adopted a more of a restrained strategy, and we'd be safer for it by staying out of avoidable trouble."
p610
aS'You know, the -- this argument sort of reinterprets the Cold War.'
p611
aS'We didnt get into the Cold War to make global stability or secure international system.'
p612
aS'We were defending Europe against communism.'
p613
aS'We were defending some of our Asian allies against communism.'
p614
aS'And then our allies got rich.'
p615
aS"And we invented a new rationale for what we're doing."
p616
aS'And so the new story is we agree to defend them, and they agree to let us.'
p617
aS'But I think our allies now have the capacity to defend themselves, and we ought to let them do that.'
p618
aS"And I think what we'll see that happens is a stable balance of power in Asia."
p619
aS"And in Europe, there's basically no threats, so that's not a problem."
p620
aS"But we'll see a stable balance of power."

p633
aS'I think if we cut the Pentagon budget to zero, sure, that would be a gift.But the cuts that are on offer in our political system are a different story.'
p634
aS"The presidentright now wants to spend roughly $550 billion on defense, including -- that's nationaldefense, budget function 050."
p635
aS"That doesn't include the wars."
p636
aS"Under sequestration,under the cap that we have in place for this coming fiscal year, that'd have to comedown about 50 billion."
p637
aS"And over the decade, we'd spend 4.8 trillion on defense insteadof 5.3 trillion."
p638
aS"We'd still account for over 40 percent of global military spending andspend more than we did at most points during the Cold War in real terms."
p639
aS"GDPmeasures -- the percentage of GDP measures what percentage of wealth we'respending."
p640
aS"But, of course, our economy's been growing that whole time."
p641
aS"We spend --we're seven times wealthier than we were in 1950 or something like that."
p642
aS"So if thatamount of spending is a gift to our enemies, it's sort of a crappy first night of Hanukkahtype gift, like sweat socks or toothpaste.I think our enemies are too far behind for it to matter much."
p643
aS"They're sort of small [[laughter]] potatoes, historically speaking, especially when you consider our wealth, ourtechnological prowess, and our geographic advantage; these oceans around us and ourweak and peaceful neighbors."
p644
aS'Our biggest threat right now, according to pretty mucheveryone, is a scattered and increasingly pathetic remnant of the al-Qaeda terroristmovement thats failed to do much since 2001 except scare us into terrorizing ourselves.'
p645
aS"And even if you don't buy that take, you ought to recognize that aggressivecounterterrorism operations with drones, with special operations forces, intelligencegalore requires only a tiny fraction of our military budget."
p646
aS"And our state enemies, NorthKorea, Iran, Syria, they're brutal regimes that pose little threat here."
p647
aS'They lack thecapacity to conquer their neighbors, let alone come over here and harm us.'
p648
aS"Russia, ifyou want to consider that an enemy, of course, has a lot of nuclear weapons, but with adwindling population, a rusty conventional military dependent on an economy that'sabout equal to the Iberian Peninsula's, its days of threatening Western Europe are longgone, whatever we do.Now, China is a bigger issue."
p649
aS"I'm sure it will come up a bunch here."
p650
aS'But they spendabout a third of what we do on defense, on the military.'
p651
aS'And most of that goes toground forces that are largely irrelevant to a naval and air war that we might have withthem if we had any war.'
p652
aS'We have 11 carriers.'
p653
aS'They have one that they practice on.'
p654
aS'Their much heralded anti-ship, ballistic missile capability which is supposed to be athreat to our ships, at the moment remains quite vulnerable to variouscountermeasures that we have.'
p655
aS'And I think maintaining that edge is not a problem ofabsolute resources.'
p656
aS"More important, China's a trading partner, not a real enemy, thatwe have no good reason to threaten unless were eager to fight a war over disputedPacific rocks which we're not."
p657
aS"I think we should hedge against China's rise not bysurrounding it with our forces, which likely encourages its military buildup, but bystaying rich and avoiding debt and keeping a technological edge to allow a buildup laterif need be.I think the real question, when it comes to military spending is what's best not for ourenemies, or worse for our enemies, but what's best for us."
p658
aS'And I think what we want isthe cheapest possible military that can defend our shores, that can keep trade routesopen in times of duress.'
p659
aS'And fulfill the balancing function, that long guided British andthen U.S. military policy for a long time.'
p660
aS'It is to prevent a big rival from emergingoverseas that can conquer our friends and threaten us.'
p661
aS'And I think we can do that quiteeasily with very little overseas military presence right now.'
p662
aS'What the other side wantsfrom our military is global dominance, which I think is not really possible.'
p663
aS"They'll saythat current or greater spending is necessary to our military strategy which is primacy,which is to be a sort of globe girdling policeman.And that strategy is necessary to global stability."
p664
aS'And I think both parts of thatstatement are wrong.'
p665
aS'First, we could do essentially what we do in the world now interms of our alliances, naval patrols, bases, at a substantially cheaper cost.'
p666
aS'I think youcould trim at least 50 billion off the defense budget and do all the stuff we do now.'
p667
aS"Ican't explain the details of how you get there, but a good place to start, if you'reinterested, is Dr. Krepinevich's Foreign Affairs article from I think it was February thisyear that says we'll shift a bunch of money out of the army into the Navy."
p668
aS"I think that'sa good idea."
p669
aS'I think you could also look at the joint letter that those -- a number of thinktanks signed on to that had a bunch of efficiency savings, including another round and personnel cost reform.'
p670
aS"We're not destined to spend what wedo right now on personnel."
p671
aS'And both my opponents signed that letter.'
p672
aS"Second, globalpeace and trade I think would be fine if we adopted a more of a restrained strategy, andwe'd be safer for it by staying out of avoidable trouble.You know, the -- this argument sort of reinterprets the Cold War."
p673
aS'We didnt get into theCold War to make global stability or secure international system.'
p674
aS'We were defendingEurope against communism.'
p675
aS'We were defending some of our Asian allies againstcommunism.'
p676
aS'And then our allies got rich.'
p677
aS"And we invented a new rationale for whatwe're doing."
p678
aS'And so the new story is we agree to defend them, and they agree to let us.'
p679
aS'But I think our allies now have the capacity to defend themselves, and we ought to letthem do that.'
p680
aS"And I think what we'll see that happens is a stable balance of power inAsia."
p681
aS"And in Europe, there's basically no threats, so that's not a problem."
p682
aS"But we'll see astable balance of power."
p683
aS"And as for trade, trade routes, we don't really defend themnow."
p684
aS"There's very little military protection of them."

p761

p762
aS'The smartest soldier of all time said that everything in war is simple, but the simple things are difficult.'
p763
aS"And this debate is a perfect example of why that's true."
p764
aS"We're really talking about three things and how they relate to one another."
p765
aS'We talk about money and budgets.'
p766
aS"And you've already heard a fog of numbers being thrown out and slices of pies being alluded to."
p767
aS"It's a lot of money that we're talking about."
p768
aS'But I would ask you to consider defense spending in a different way, as not just a cost proposition but a value proposition.'
p769
aS"Are we getting a return on our investment that's worth it as taxpayers and Americans?"
p770

p771
aS"Andy says for 3 cents out of our dollar, whether we're getting the global dominance that Ben suggested or merely treading water, we have a remarkably peaceful world."
p772

p773
aS'And personally, I would like to keep it that way.'
p774
aS"That's something that I can't quite put a price tag on."
p775
aS"And what we're spending now is certainly affordable."
p776
aS'So ask yourselves, is it worth the money we spend?'
p777
aS"That's the way I would ask you guys to consider the proposition."
p778
aS'Second part is even more unpleasant, the idea that we have enemies in the world.'
p779
aS"We don't like to think that as Americans."
p780
aS'You know, we wish everybody loved us and we try to love them, but it is a dangerous world.'
p781

p782
aS"We're going to have a discussion about that."
p783
aS"Reasonable people can differ over who's the biggest threat and what the size of the danger is, but, again, do you want to take a risk with this?"

p785
aS"They're not all enemies."
p786
aS"There're people who are sitting on the fence one way or the other."
p787
aS"I would prefer to live in a world where we have fewer enemies and the ones that might be enemies don't want to mess with us."
p788
aS"And, again, I think that's a great value proposition."
p789
aS"The final part of the proposition is whether it's a gift to our enemies or not."
p790
aS'As Andy said, "We don\'t know whether it\'s a gift, but it is already, we can tell, a dangerous temptation," as we see in the Middle East today.'
p791
aS"As we have come home from Iraq and we're about to depart from Afghanistan, we see in Syria a war that's metastasizing, it's like the Iraq civil war that we saw in 2006, only on steroids, much more so."
p792
aS'So is that a gift to our enemies?'

aS"I don't know."
p794
aS"It's not a gift."
p795
aS'Going to war is never a gift.'
p796
aS'Our withdrawal from the world after World War I was not a gift to Germany and Japan but it was a dangerous temptation to Adolf Hitler and to the Imperial Japanese.'
p797
aS'World War II was a gift to nobody but it was a necessary thing to do and a temptation to evil people in the world, and there are evil people in the world.'
p798
aS'So well work through all these questions.'
p799
aS'I like it that we have allies.'
p800
aS'They provide the battlefield.'
p801
aS"That -- you can't put a price tag on that."
p802
aS"It's better to fight over there than it is here at home."
p803
aS"So having America be powerful as well as be engaged in the world out there in the world has created a world that's more prosperous, that's safer, and for Americans possibly the most important point is freer than it has ever been in human history."

(lp898
S'So I agree with everything Tom Donnelly just said, and I think you can still agree with Ben and me that cutting defense spending is not a gift to our enemies without compromising anything Tom just said.'
p899
aS"And let me try and walk you through why I think that's so."
p900
aS'First, as most of you probably know, 31 cents of every dollar the United States government spends, it borrows.'
p901
aS'We may only spend 3 percent of it on defense, but 31 percent of it, we have to borrow.'
p902
aS"Our national debt, the extent to which our spending is outpacing our revenue, that's the gift to America's enemies."
p903
aS'We actually really need to bring our spending into alignment with our revenue, and the defense budget has doubled since 2001.'
p904
aS'The sequestration, the means by which we are further reducing it is damaging, but the reduction in the top line, the overall level of spending is manageable while maintaining a strong national defense, while retaining allies, while retaining the value proposition, and while frightening our enemies.'
p905
aS'The United States constitutes -- our own defense budget is 40 percent of global defense spending.'
p906
aS'40 percent, all by itself.'
p907
aS"There are 21 aircraft carriers in the fleets of the world's navies."
p908
aS'Eleven of those are in our navy.'
p909
aS'American dominance in the military realm is overwhelming.'
p910
aS'Of all the places you could cut spending -- in fact, the margin for error in national defense is enormous.'
p911
aS'As Tom said, the value proposition that the American military provides: we can do things that other militaries cannot do and that drives our enemies to radical, asymmetric strategies.'
p912
aS'It drives them to terrorism.'
p913
aS'It drives them to cyber warfare.'
p914
aS"It drives them to things -- because they know they couldn't actually fight the American army and defeat it."
p915
aS"It drives them to strategies of trying to erode our national will to fight the war, because if we fight it, we're going to win it."
p916
aS'In regard to the threat from China: China is rising.'
p917
aS"And we're smart to hedge against a rising China."
p918
aS'But I would encourage you to remember that one of the most important strategic variables, one of the most important advantages you can have, is time.'
p919
aS'And we actually have a lot of time to figure out how to deal with a rising China.'
p920
aS'And our -- the American military is one of many means for managing that rise and one in which we have a strong advantage.'
p921
aS"A second thing I'd like to ask you to consider is -- I agree with Tom about the value proposition."
p922
aS'The American military is extraordinarily good at what it does.'
p923
aS'That does not mean that the money that we spend on our defense we spend well.'
p924
aS'Right?'
p925
aS"The Defense Department, in truth, actually doesn't know if we have enough money to spend on American defense, because they actually cannot pass an audit that every American business has to pass."
p926
aS"They already told Congress they won't be able to pass an audit until 2017."
p927
aS'Given that the budget has doubled in the last 10 years, and DOD cannot account for the money, that suggests to me that there are reasonable places in the budget from which we could wring greater effectiveness in our spending.'
p928
aS'The American military is terrific at the effectiveness of war-fighting.'
p929
aS"We're not cost effective."
p930
aS"We're not particularly efficient at how we do it."
p931
aS'And I would offer you the testimony of General Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that if we forced ourselves to think, we could probably do this with less resources.'
p932

S'So I agree with everything Tom Donnelly just said, and I think you can still agree withBen and me that cutting defense spending is not a gift to our enemies withoutcompromising anything Tom just said.'
p952
aS"And let me try and walk you through why I thinkthat's so."
p953
aS'First, as most of you probably know, 31 cents of every dollar the United Statesgovernment spends, it borrows.'
p954
aS'We may only spend 3 percent of it on defense, but 31percent of it, we have to borrow.'
p955
aS"Our national debt, the extent to which our spending isoutpacing our revenue, that's the gift to America's enemies."
p956
aS'We actually really need tobring our spending into alignment with our revenue, and the defense budget hasdoubled since 2001.'
p957
aS'The sequestration, the means by which we are further reducing itis damaging, but the reduction in the top line, the overall level of spending ismanageable while maintaining a strong national defense, while retaining allies, whileretaining the value proposition, and while frightening our enemies.The United States constitutes -- our own defense budget is 40 percent of global defensespending.'
p958
aS'40 percent, all by itself.'
p959
aS"There are 21 aircraft carriers in the fleets of theworld's navies."
p960
aS'Eleven of those are in our navy.'
p961
aS'American dominance in the militaryrealm is overwhelming.'
p962
aS'Of all the places you could cut spending -- in fact, the margin forerror in national defense is enormous.'
p963
aS'As Tom said, the value proposition that theAmerican military provides: we can do things that other militaries cannot do and thatdrives our enemies to radical, asymmetric strategies.It drives them to terrorism.'
p964
aS'It drives them to cyber warfare.'
p965
aS"It drives them to things --because they know they couldn't actually fight the American army and defeat it."
p966
aS"Itdrives them to strategies of trying to erode our national will to fight the war, because ifwe fight it, we're going to win it.In regard to the threat from China: China is rising."
p967
aS"And we're smart to hedge against arising China."
p968
aS'But I would encourage you to remember that one of the most importantstrategic variables, one of the most important advantages you can have, is time.'
p969
aS'Andwe actually have a lot of time to figure out how to deal with a rising China.'
p970
aS"And our --the American military is one of many means for managing that rise and one in which wehave a strong advantage.A second thing I'd like to ask you to consider is -- I agree with Tom about the valueproposition.The American military is extraordinarily good at what it does."
p971
aS'That does not mean thatthe money that we spend on our defense we spend well.'
p972
aS'Right?'
p973
aS"The DefenseDepartment, in truth, actually doesn't know if we have enough money to spend onAmerican defense, because they actually cannot pass an audit that every Americanbusiness has to pass."
p974
aS"They already told Congress they won't be able to pass an audituntil 2017."
p975
aS'Given that the budget has doubled in the last 10 years, and DOD cannotaccount for the money, that suggests to me that there are reasonable places in thebudget from which we could wring greater effectiveness in our spending.'
p976
aS'The Americanmilitary is terrific at the effectiveness of war-fighting.'
p977
aS"We're not cost effective."
p978
aS"We'renot particularly efficient at how we do it.And I would offer you the testimony of General Dempsey, the chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, who said that if we forced ourselves to think, we could probably do thiswith less resources."
p979
aS'He also said that because budgets have essentially beenunconstrained for the last 10 years, the American military has gotten into a lot of badhabits.'
p980
aS"As Admiral Mullen, General Dempsey's predecessor, said, we have raised ageneration of military leaders who don't know how to budget because they've neverhad to do it.Let me just point out to you some of the cost-drivers or how expensive Americandefense is."
