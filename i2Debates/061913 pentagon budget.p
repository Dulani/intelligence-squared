p313
aS'compliment our worthy adversaries, without whom we could not have a debate here'
p314
aS'tonight.'
p315
aS'Tom and I, in terms of this proposition, believe that further cuts in our defenses will'
p316
aS'encourage our adversaries, and at the same time, increase the risks to our security, our'
p317
aS'economic well-being, and the security and economic well-being of our allies and'
p318
aS"partners around the world. In terms of the overall perspective -- but let's take a look at"
p319
aS'the big view. At the end of the Cold War, 20 years ago, we were spending, on average, 6'
p320
aS'percent of our GDP every year on our defenses. Six percent. Okay?'
p321
aS"In the span of 20 years, this year, we're down to three percent of our GDP being spent"
p322
aS'on defense. So we have cut in half the amount of our national wealth that we have'
p323
aS"devoted to our defenses, okay? I don't think you can find another major part of the"
p324
aS"federal budget where you have this kind of cut. So, that's point number one."
p325
aS'Point number two is if you look at the defense budget, you see several, I think,'
p326
aS'important things. One is 30 days ago this year, we decided -- we made a social choice,'
p327
aS'to adopt a volunteer military. And we never really fully paid the price of that choice'
p328
aS'until after 9/11, when we engaged in a protracted conflict in Afghanistan and then in'
p329
aS'Iraq. In order to recruit and retain sufficient members of -- service members to conduct'
p330
aS"those operations, we've had to increase personnel spending by over 50 percent, after"
p331
aS'inflation, since 9/11.'
p332
aS"So that's a dramatic increase. On top of that, the Obama Administration has set forth a"
p333
aS'revised defense plan which looks to cut nearly half a trillion dollars out of our defenses'
p334
aS'over the next 10 years. So what do you get? You get a shrinking defense pie, number'
p335
aS'one. Number two, within that shrinking pie, you get an expanded slice for personnel'
p336
aS"costs. What does that mean? That means in the coming years, we're going to see a lot"
p337
aS'less funding for training, a lot less funding for maintaining our equipment, and a lot less'
p338
aS"money for replacing all the worn out equipment. I've been to this movie before. This is"
p339
aS'the equation for a hollow military. This is the equation for a military that gradually loses'
p340
aS'its effectiveness and capability.'
p341
aS"Now, how will our enemies react to this? Is this a gift to them? I don't know. I'm not --"
p342
aS"I'm not privy to their thoughts. What I can tell you is that the silence is deafening. And"
p343
aS'as Napoleon once said, When your enemy is in the middle of making a great mistake,'
p344
aS"don't interrupt them. And again -- so you have this particular situation. Now, some"
p345
aS"people say, Well, gee. We're pulling out of Afghanistan. We're out of Iraq. Let's"
p346
aS'reduce defense spending. After all, the threat is diminishing. Well, first of all, our'
p347
aS'operations in those conflicts were funded by something called OCOB, the Overseas'
p348
aS'Contingency Operation Budget. And those budgets are coming down and will go down'
p349
aS'to zero. But the base defense budget --- typically, when you draw down that budget,'
p350
aS"that is when the threat is declining. And as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we're in a"
p351
aS'situation right now where the threat is not declining.'
p352
aS"He had a pretty good short list, but there's a longer list we can go through. John"
p353
aS'mentioned that we brought together four think tanks, from the moderate liberal to the'
p354
aS'moderate conservative, a few weeks ago to look at the sequestration cuts. And these'
p355
aS"are cuts -- let's -- hey, let's cut another half trillion dollars out of defense over the next"
p356
aS"decade. Despite the fact that there's a fair part of the political spectrum that was"
p357
aS'covered, there are two conclusions that the four think tanks agreed upon: The first is'
p358
aS'that cuts of the magnitude that are discussed and put forth in sequestration will be a'
p359
aS'disaster in terms of our military readiness and capability. Second, there is a belief --'
p360
aS'again all four think tanks -- belief that the dangers to our security, the dangers to our'
p361
aS'economic well-being are increasing over time.'
p362
aS"We've cut our budget since the end of World War II in the past, it's been when the"
p363
aS"threat's been declining, not when the threat's been increasing. So to sum up, those who"
p364

p393
aS'But the cuts that are on offer in our political system are a different story. The president'
p394
aS"right now wants to spend roughly $550 billion on defense, including -- that's national"
p395
aS"defense, budget function 050. That doesn't include the wars. Under sequestration,"
p396
aS"under the cap that we have in place for this coming fiscal year, that'd have to come"
p397
aS"down about 50 billion. And over the decade, we'd spend 4.8 trillion on defense instead"
p398
aS"of 5.3 trillion. We'd still account for over 40 percent of global military spending and"
p399
aS'spend more than we did at most points during the Cold War in real terms. GDP'
p400
aS"measures -- the percentage of GDP measures what percentage of wealth we're"
p401
aS"spending. But, of course, our economy's been growing that whole time. We spend --"
p402
aS"we're seven times wealthier than we were in 1950 or something like that. So if that"
p403
aS"amount of spending is a gift to our enemies, it's sort of a crappy first night of Hanukkah"
p404
aS'type gift, like sweat socks or toothpaste.'
p405
aS"I think our enemies are too far behind for it to matter much. They're sort of small"
p406
aS'potatoes, historically speaking, especially when you consider our wealth, our'
p407
aS'technological prowess, and our geographic advantage; these oceans around us and our'
p408
aS'weak and peaceful neighbors. Our biggest threat right now, according to pretty much'
p409
aS'everyone, is a scattered and increasingly pathetic remnant of the al-Qaeda terrorist'
p410
aS'movement thats failed to do much since 2001 except scare us into terrorizing ourselves.'
p411
aS" And even if you don't buy that take, you ought to recognize that aggressive"
p412
aS'counterterrorism operations with drones, with special operations forces, intelligence'
p413
aS'galore requires only a tiny fraction of our military budget. And our state enemies, North'
p414
aS"Korea, Iran, Syria, they're brutal regimes that pose little threat here. They lack the"
p415
aS'capacity to conquer their neighbors, let alone come over here and harm us. Russia, if'
p416
aS'you want to consider that an enemy, of course, has a lot of nuclear weapons, but with a'
p417
aS"dwindling population, a rusty conventional military dependent on an economy that's"
p418
aS"about equal to the Iberian Peninsula's, its days of threatening Western Europe are long"
p419
aS'gone, whatever we do.'
p420
aS"Now, China is a bigger issue. I'm sure it will come up a bunch here. But they spend"
p421
aS'about a third of what we do on defense, on the military. And most of that goes to'
p422
aS'ground forces that are largely irrelevant to a naval and air war that we might have with'
p423
aS'them if we had any war. We have 11 carriers. They have one that they practice on.'
p424
aS' Their much heralded anti-ship, ballistic missile capability which is supposed to be a'
p425
aS'threat to our ships, at the moment remains quite vulnerable to various'
p426
aS'countermeasures that we have. And I think maintaining that edge is not a problem of'
p427
aS"absolute resources. More important, China's a trading partner, not a real enemy, that"
p428
aS'we have no good reason to threaten unless were eager to fight a war over disputed'
p429
aS"Pacific rocks which we're not. I think we should hedge against China's rise not by"
p430
aS'surrounding it with our forces, which likely encourages its military buildup, but by'
p431
aS'staying rich and avoiding debt and keeping a technological edge to allow a buildup later'
p432
aS'if need be.'
p433
aS"I think the real question, when it comes to military spending is what's best not for our"
p434
aS"enemies, or worse for our enemies, but what's best for us. And I think what we want is"
p435
aS'the cheapest possible military that can defend our shores, that can keep trade routes'
p436
aS'open in times of duress. And fulfill the balancing function, that long guided British and'
p437
aS'then U.S. military policy for a long time. It is to prevent a big rival from emerging'
p438
aS'overseas that can conquer our friends and threaten us. And I think we can do that quite'
p439
aS'easily with very little overseas military presence right now. What the other side wants'
p440
aS"from our military is global dominance, which I think is not really possible. They'll say"
p441
aS'that current or greater spending is necessary to our military strategy which is primacy,'
p442
aS'which is to be a sort of globe girdling policeman.'
p443
aS'And that strategy is necessary to global stability. And I think both parts of that'
p444
aS'statement are wrong. First, we could do essentially what we do in the world now in'
p445
aS'terms of our alliances, naval patrols, bases, at a substantially cheaper cost. I think you'
p446
aS'could trim at least 50 billion off the defense budget and do all the stuff we do now. I'
p447
aS"can't explain the details of how you get there, but a good place to start, if you're"
p448
aS"interested, is Dr. Krepinevich's Foreign Affairs article from I think it was February this"
p449
aS"year that says we'll shift a bunch of money out of the army into the Navy. I think that's"
p450
aS'a good idea. I think you could also look at the joint letter that those -- a number of think'
p451
aS'tanks signed on to that had a bunch of efficiency savings, including another'
p452
aS" round and personnel cost reform. We're not destined to spend what we"
p453
aS'do right now on personnel. And both my opponents signed that letter. Second, global'
p454
aS'peace and trade I think would be fine if we adopted a more of a restrained strategy, and'
p455
aS"we'd be safer for it by staying out of avoidable trouble."
p456
aS'You know, the -- this argument sort of reinterprets the Cold War. We didnt get into the'
p457
aS'Cold War to make global stability or secure international system. We were defending'
p458
aS'Europe against communism. We were defending some of our Asian allies against'
p459
aS'communism. And then our allies got rich. And we invented a new rationale for what'
p460
aS"we're doing. And so the new story is we agree to defend them, and they agree to let us."
p461
aS' But I think our allies now have the capacity to defend themselves, and we ought to let'
p462
aS"them do that. And I think what we'll see that happens is a stable balance of power in"
p463
aS"Asia. And in Europe, there's basically no threats, so that's not a problem. But we'll see a"
p464
aS"stable balance of power. And as for trade, trade routes, we don't really defend them"
p465
aS"now. There's very little military protection of them."

p520
aS'coming in here and talking about defense budgets is perhaps not the way I would spend'
p521
aS'my afternoon if I had a choice.'
p522
aS'The smartest soldier of all time said that everything in war is simple, but the simple'
p523
aS"things are difficult. And this debate is a perfect example of why that's true. We're really"
p524
aS'talking about three things and how they relate to one another. We talk about money'
p525
aS"and budgets. And you've already heard a fog of numbers being thrown out and slices of"
p526
aS"pies being alluded to. It's a lot of money that we're talking about. But I would ask you"
p527
aS'to consider defense spending in a different way, as not just a cost proposition but a'
p528
aS"value proposition. Are we getting a return on our investment that's worth it as"
p529
aS'taxpayers and Americans? I would say absolutely. Andy says for 3 cents out of our'
p530
aS"dollar, whether we're getting the global dominance that Ben suggested or merely"
p531
aS'treading water, we have a remarkably peaceful world.'
p532
aS"There hasn't been a great power war since the end of World War II. And personally, I"
p533
aS"would like to keep it that way. That's something that I can't quite put a price tag on."
p534
aS" And what we're spending now is certainly affordable. So ask yourselves, is it worth the"
p535
aS"money we spend? That's the way I would ask you guys to consider the proposition."
p536
aS'Second part is even more unpleasant, the idea that we have enemies in the world. We'
p537
aS"don't like to think that as Americans. You know, we wish everybody loved us and we try"
p538
aS'to love them, but it is a dangerous world. Ben sort of downplayed all the threats that'
p539
aS"are out there. We're going to have a discussion about that. Reasonable people can"
p540
aS"differ over who's the biggest threat and what the size of the danger is, but, again, do"
p541
aS"you want to take a risk with this? If we're much stronger than our enemies, is that a bad"
p542
aS"thing? They're not all enemies. There're people who are sitting on the fence one way"
p543
aS'or the other.'
p544
aS'I would prefer to live in a world where we have fewer enemies and the ones that might'
p545
aS"be enemies don't want to mess with us. And, again, I think that's a great value"
p546
aS"proposition. The final part of the proposition is whether it's a gift to our enemies or not."
p547
aS' As Andy said, "We don\'t know whether it\'s a gift, but it is already, we can tell, a'
p548
aS'dangerous temptation," as we see in the Middle East today. As we have come home'
p549
aS"from Iraq and we're about to depart from Afghanistan, we see in Syria a war that's"
p550
aS"metastasizing, it's like the Iraq civil war that we saw in 2006, only on steroids, much"
p551
aS"more so. So is that a gift to our enemies? I don't know. It's not a gift. Going to war is"
p552
aS'never a gift. Our withdrawal from the world after World War I was not a gift to'
p553
aS'Germany and Japan but it was a dangerous temptation to Adolf Hitler and to the'
p554
aS'Imperial Japanese.'
p555
aS' World War II was a gift to nobody but it was a necessary thing to do and a temptation'
p556
aS'to evil people in the world, and there are evil people in the world. So well work'
p557
aS'through all these questions. I like it that we have allies. They provide the battlefield.'
p558
aS" That -- you can't put a price tag on that. It's better to fight over there than it is here at"
p559
aS'home. So having America be powerful as well as be engaged in the world out there in'
p560
aS"the world has created a world that's more prosperous, that's safer, and for Americans"
p561
aS'possibly the most important point is freer than it has ever been in human history. We'
p562
aS"should not give that up. You don't win prizes in war for being the guy who does it in the"
p563
aS"cheapest way. There are no style points. The outcome is what matters, and that's what"
p564
aS'we should be focusing on when we weigh this proposition. Is it a gift to our enemies?'
p565
aS' No.'
p566
aS"That is a temptation to them, it's a risk for our friends, and it could be a real danger to"
p567
aS'us. We send very few Americans -- we have -- the world is so peaceful, and our military'
p568
aS'is so good that it only takes less than 1 percent of us to maintain the peace. I think'
p569
aS"that's worth a priceless investment, almost. Vote for us."

S'So I agree with everything Tom Donnelly just said, and I think you can still agree with'
p597
aS'Ben and me that cutting defense spending is not a gift to our enemies without'
p598
aS'compromising anything Tom just said. And let me try and walk you through why I think'
p599
aS"that's so. First, as most of you probably know, 31 cents of every dollar the United States"
p600
aS'government spends, it borrows. We may only spend 3 percent of it on defense, but 31'
p601
aS'percent of it, we have to borrow. Our national debt, the extent to which our spending is'
p602
aS"outpacing our revenue, that's the gift to America's enemies. We actually really need to"
p603
aS'bring our spending into alignment with our revenue, and the defense budget has'
p604
aS'doubled since 2001. The sequestration, the means by which we are further reducing it'
p605
aS'is damaging, but the reduction in the top line, the overall level of spending is'
p606
aS'manageable while maintaining a strong national defense, while retaining allies, while'
p607
aS'retaining the value proposition, and while frightening our enemies.'
p608
aS'The United States constitutes -- our own defense budget is 40 percent of global defense'
p609
aS'spending. 40 percent, all by itself. There are 21 aircraft carriers in the fleets of the'
p610
aS"world's navies. Eleven of those are in our navy. American dominance in the military"
p611
aS'realm is overwhelming. Of all the places you could cut spending -- in fact, the margin for'
p612
aS'error in national defense is enormous. As Tom said, the value proposition that the'
p613
aS'American military provides: we can do things that other militaries cannot do and that'
p614
aS'drives our enemies to radical, asymmetric strategies.'
p615
aS'It drives them to terrorism. It drives them to cyber warfare. It drives them to things --'
p616
aS"because they know they couldn't actually fight the American army and defeat it. It"
p617
aS'drives them to strategies of trying to erode our national will to fight the war, because if'
p618
aS"we fight it, we're going to win it."
p619
aS"In regard to the threat from China: China is rising. And we're smart to hedge against a"
p620
aS'rising China. But I would encourage you to remember that one of the most important'
p621
aS'strategic variables, one of the most important advantages you can have, is time. And'
p622
aS'we actually have a lot of time to figure out how to deal with a rising China. And our --'
p623
aS'the American military is one of many means for managing that rise and one in which we'
p624
aS'have a strong advantage.'
p625
aS"A second thing I'd like to ask you to consider is -- I agree with Tom about the value"
p626
aS'proposition.'
p627
aS'The American military is extraordinarily good at what it does. That does not mean that'
p628
aS'the money that we spend on our defense we spend well. Right? The Defense'
p629
aS"Department, in truth, actually doesn't know if we have enough money to spend on"
p630
aS'American defense, because they actually cannot pass an audit that every American'
p631
aS"business has to pass. They already told Congress they won't be able to pass an audit"
p632
aS'until 2017. Given that the budget has doubled in the last 10 years, and DOD cannot'
p633
aS'account for the money, that suggests to me that there are reasonable places in the'
p634
aS'budget from which we could wring greater effectiveness in our spending. The American'
p635
aS"military is terrific at the effectiveness of war-fighting. We're not cost effective. We're"
p636
aS'not particularly efficient at how we do it.'
p637
aS'And I would offer you the testimony of General Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint'
p638
aS'Chiefs of Staff, who said that if we forced ourselves to think, we could probably do this'
p639
aS'with less resources. He also said that because budgets have essentially been'
p640
aS'unconstrained for the last 10 years, the American military has gotten into a lot of bad'
p641
aS"habits. As Admiral Mullen, General Dempsey's predecessor, said, we have raised a"
p642
aS"generation of military leaders who don't know how to budget because they've never"
p643
aS'had to do it.'
p644
aS'Let me just point out to you some of the cost-drivers or how expensive American'
p645
aS'defense is. GAO determined the last year that we wasted $74 billion in the year 2012'
p646
aS'because of the procurement process, because of what Senator McCain has described as'
p647
aS'the political -- as the military industrial Congressional complex.'
p648
aS"The Pentagon's determined we have 20 percent more bases and facilities than we need"
p649
aS'and Congress will not permit them to close them. The military -- the Pentagon has tried'
p650
aS'to ramp down the expansion of the personnel account -- military raises, housing,'
p651
aS"funding, pensions -- and Congress won't do it. So even the Pentagon understands the"
p652
aS'resources to be saved here. In fact, the position that we are in is that we have the'
p653
aS"world's finest military and that all-volunteer force is becoming unaffordable. We have"
p654
aS'to better constrain the costs of our defense. And even within national security, there'
p655
aS'are things that need money even more than the American military, right? If you look at'
p656
aS'why were are not more decisively winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the wars we'
p657
aS"have fought in the last 10 years, the reason is we're underfunding diplomacy,"
p658
aS'development, other things we need to spend our money on.'
