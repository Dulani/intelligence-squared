aS'And we can talkabout the relative advantages.'

aS"But I think it's important also to address the issue Kaelmentioned of the strike on Sunday.It's important to know that that strike killed the individual who publicly admitted tokidnapping Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of the United States Army who was still the onlyAmerican service person who is incarcerated in Afghanistan today."
p674
aS'Now, it may be thatothers were also injured and/or killed in this event.'
p675
aS'But I would argue that Afghanistanis a declared combat zone, ladies and gentlemen.'
p676
aS'And under the rules of armed conflict,that this individual was a legitimate target and clearly a combatant.'
p677
aS'And he will kidnapno more American servicemen.But let me go back to a bit more balanced discussion.'
p678
aS'What I want to do tonight -- and Isubmit, ladies and gentlemen, that the employment of U.S. strike-capable systems is aviable and a rational response to a vexing battlefield problem, one that must becalibrated, used with care, synced withpolicy.'
p679
aS'But nonetheless, one that allows us topursue our objectives in a fashion that minimizes loss of life for friendly forces andmaximizes the opportunity to avoid needless casualties of friendlies; in other words,collateral damage.Simply remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, permit more considered and more accurateand, as a result, more proportionate application of lethal force than any othercomparable weapon system.'
p680
aS'Because they can spend longer time over the target thanequivalent manned aircraft, they give their operators the time to maximize the certaintybut not necessarily achieve absolute certainty that they are engaging the right enemycombatants and that they have the time and the means to confirm the presence ofnoncombatants in the presence of the intended target.'
p681
aS'Thoughtful observers like ourpartners tonight have mentioned a number of criticisms.'
p682
aS"Let me talk quickly about acouple of them.One is that the absence of physical risk to the operator encourages our politicalleadership to use remote systems more often than they would if they had to putAmerican troops in harm's way."
p683
aS'I would counter by asking whether those who use thisargument would prefer for the American military to absorb casualties just for thepurpose of making war less numbing to the political leadership.'
p684
aS"In addition -- that's atactical level -- is the ability of remote systems to maintain surveillance of target areaswith remote operators carefully and deliberately evaluating potential targets against thecriteria that allows them to shoot, that makes this system so discriminating andeffective.Soldiers and airmen under fire on the ground I think you would agree, Kael, are far morelikely to shoot back at the sources of fire aimed against them, with greater danger tononcombatants than are remote operators whose safety and lives are not at immediaterisk."
p685
aS"There's also a concern that nonstate or state actors will use these technologiesagainst us in a more crude and indiscriminate fashion than do we."
p686
aS'And well, they might.But the reality is is that this technology is proliferating, and not because we chose to useit.'
p687
aS'It is a fact of technology advancing.'
p688
aS'And our lead was and remains significant.So, let me go to a quick summary of some data.'
p689
aS'This goes back to 2011 in Afghanistanduring the surge period.'
p690
aS'There are about 150,000 Air Force flights in Afghanistan in2011.'
p691
aS'Sadly, about 3,000 of those flights were medical evacuation sorties of ourwounded, and our dead.'
p692
aS'Compare that total to 25,000 close air support sorties andsupport of ground forces, your Marines, of which 1,400 had at least one weaponrelease.'
p693
aS'So what this means is, is out of 25,000 sorties, 1,400 actually released aweapon.'
p694
aS'There were many sorties that flew with no weapon release at all.'
p695
aS"That's whata professional Air Force does."
p696
aS'Ready, finger on the trigger, but extremely careful anddeliberate about applying lethal force in practice and in principle.333 of those 400 weapon releases were by remote systems.'
p697
aS'Now, I ask you, were thosereleases -- the three quarters of the releases -- from manned aircraft somehow morepractical, less immoral, less unfair than those 25 percent that were released byunmanned aircraft?'

S"The first thing I think to make clear is that unfortunately drones -- which is -- it's aweapon, it's a tool, it's a tactic -- has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is howforeign governments and countries where drones are being used see it."
p770
aS'All the good ofU.S.'
p771
aS'foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, etcetera, all are demolished when at the same time the U.S. uses drones.'
p772
aS'So in factdrones are undermining U.S. foreign policy.'
p773
aS'They become the only symbol of foreignpolicy which people abroad remember when they are -- when those countries inparticular are targeted.'
p774
aS'And some of the countries like Yemen, like Pakistan are in factallies of the United States and drones are being used against allies, naturally that isinfuriating the population even more.Secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the muchmore sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the U.S. in the last few years, wherethe whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive,development, et cetera.'
p775
aS'Again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy beingundermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, andthey do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda.'
p776
aS"The otherquestion which I think has to be agitating the minds of many Americans is how legal isthis?How legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not atwar, with which nothing has been disclosed, there's no transparency involved, nobody isinformed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again,taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the U.S."
p777
aS'The lack of transparencyis not helped by the fact that the CIA has been mostly involved in using drones,especially in Pakistan.'
p778
aS"If -- and certainly there's a move now to move some of thesedrone attacks to the defense department, but -- and that could increase transparency,but at the moment the CIA's running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosenor whether killing these individuals are justified or not."
p779
aS"Now, what all this is leading to isan enormous buildup of hatred for the United States, and that is not just affectingpeople in the target countries but people all over the Muslim world in particular.It's quite shocking to see the figures in Pakistan."
p780
aS'One poll puts 74 percent of Pakistanisnow hate the U.S. more than India, and remember, Pakistan has fought three warsagainst India, and India is the proverbial enemy.'
p781
aS'Another poll that I just read recently inChicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent.'
p782
aS"And here, as I sit, we're talking about a so-called ally of the United States.Now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set."
p783
aS'What happenswhen another country will start using drones?'
p784
aS'First of all, what happens if a Europeancountry, or Russia, or a so-called ally of the United States uses drones?'
p785
aS'What is the U.S.strategy going to be?'
p786
aS'How is that going to affect U.S. foreign policy?'
p787
aS'Are you going toslap that country down?'

aS'Are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, "No,only we have the right to kill people in other countries.'
p789
aS"You don't have that right."
p790
aS'"Even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the United States uses drones?What happens if North Korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill South Koreans?'
p791
aS'Whathappens if Al-Qaeda itself develops drones?'
p792
aS'What happens if any -- if the Syrians or anyof the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones?'
p793
aS'So, what will be the U.S.policy then?'
p794
aS'Are you going to go and bomb those countries?'
p795
aS'What is the U.S. strategypolicy going to be?'
p796
aS"There's a complete vacuum here."
p797
aS"There's no thought being given tothis."

aS'But this could happen tomorrow.'
p799
aS'Drones now are everywhere.'
p800
aS'Drones are beingused for all sorts of other, peaceful projects.'
p801
aS'And any of those drones can be bought onthe market and they could be converted into drones that kill people.'
p802
aS'And I think thatthe idea that somehow, the U.S. is going to have a monopoly over this instrumentforever is very short-sighted.I think the other thing that is -- that I must answer, the issue of civilian casualties.'
p803
aS'Thereis, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signaturestrikes.'
p804
aS'That is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in agroup of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, dronesare used -- can be used to kill that militant.'
p805
aS'But of course, they kill everyone else in thetruck, too.'
p806
aS'Women, children, men, civilians.'
p807
aS'Now, the last drone strike, actually, onSunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilianswere killed.'
p808
aS'And President Karzai just complained to the Americans.'
p809
aS'And they werekilled by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of thesepeople.I think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that.'
p810
aS'So, the fact is -- I mean, theissue of civilian casualties is very controversial.'
p811
aS'The Americans do not tell us what -- youknow, how many civilians have been killed.'
p812
aS'But estimates from other groups put thecasualties in Pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000.'
p813
aS"I mean, that's the levelof inaccuracy that we have, because we really don't know."
p814
aS'These areas are inaccessibleor -- and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, thedrone firer, that kind of information is available.'
p815
aS'And lastly, I think we have tounderstand how drones have been a recruiting poster for Al-Qaeda and global jihad.Even local groups -- local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with Al-Qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad -- if they have been droned, they become globaljihadists.They want to strike back at America.'
p816

S'Gen. Schwartz addressed the use of drones in a battlefield area with U.S. troops deployed.'
p920
aS"I'm going to talk about the more controversial program, in which we use drones in areas in which we do not have our troops in action."
p921
aS'And Pakistan, of course, is the primary example that comes to mind.'
p922
aS'In fact, probably our motion tonight, "U.S. drone program is fatally flawed," is shorthand for "the American drones in Pakistan have been a failure.'
p923
aS'" And you\'ve heard from Mr. Rashid some of the objections to that.'
p924
aS'I would tell you that there in fact is no independent drone program.'
p925
aS'The drones are part of a wider strategy which is dedicated to ending the threat from al-Qaeda, a threat with which this city is very, very familiar.'
p926
aS'The policy of the drones, a tactic to an end, are to take care of the hard core leaders and fighters who are not persuadable, who are not going to change their demonstrated and committed intention to kill as many Americans as they can before they -- before they can accomplish that.'
p927
aS'The -- a conflict between a country, the United States, and a non- state group like al-Qaeda, is allowed under international humanitarian law.'
p928
aS"And that's what we are involved in."
p929
aS'It began here almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago tomorrow.'
p930
aS"It has continued with al-Qaeda's affiliates."
p931
aS'Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sent a bomber to try to kill a bunch of Americans in an airplane over Detroit.'
p932
aS'TTP, Tehrik-i- Taliban in Pakistan, sent Faisal Shahzad a few blocks south of here to Times Square to kill a bunch of innocent Americans if he could.'
p933
aS'We are at war with this group.'
p934
aS'And the leadership of these organizations holed up in places like northwest Pakistan and Yemen, places where the governments of our allies, as Mr. Rashid said, do not control their territory.'
p935
aS"It's worse in Pakistan."
p936
aS'They not only do not control their territory.'
p937
aS'They give permission to the United States to take action where they cannot, and then they blame us for doing it, which accounts for a great deal of the sentiment in Pakistan when a dissembling hypocritical policy of Pakistani politicians allows them to blame us for actions which they themselves permit.'
p938
aS'But they could stop us from doing it any time.'
p939
aS'And the government in Yemen, by way of contrast, openly cooperates with us and tells its people that it does.'
p940
aS'Now, the drones have been successful.'
p941
aS'We have killed most of the people who planned, who directed, and then who gloated over the felling of the Twin Towers, the attack on the Pentagon and the aborted attack that ended in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.'
p942
aS'And we have done that not only with drones, but by armed raids, as we saw in Pakistan, by a lot of cooperation with other countries and a lot of hard intelligence.'
p943
aS'So drones have played a key role in a successful, but I would argue first phase, of our overall campaign against al-Qaeda.'
p944
aS'But what about the next phase?'
p945
aS'I think the role of drones in the next phase should be much different, not because the program has been a failure, but because the situation has changed, and the drones and other tactics have been successes.'
p946
aS'Now the job is to reduce al-Qaeda from a small-scale threat, which is where it now is, to a nuisance.'
p947
aS'And to do that, we have to undercut support for al-Qaeda.'
p948
aS"We have to make sure that Muslim mothers and fathers don't think it's a good idea to send their sons and daughters to strap on suicide vests and to kill innocent people around the world."
p949
aS'Al-Qaeda is doing a wonderful job against itself.'
p950
aS'It has killed far more Pakistanis, far more Muslims than it has Americans and Europeans.'
p951
aS'But we need to help it further along.'
p952
aS'And we must do that by becoming even more selective, even more discriminating, even more careful in our use of weapons like drones in the future.'
p953
aS'And the great bulk of our efforts must be dedicated to helping countries like Pakistan, like Yemen, like Mali, like the southern Philippines, like Somalia, like Libya, like Afghanistan, to make their lives better for their people so that they do not support those who attack the United States and their own governments and others.'
p954
aS'And this means that we need to continue to work with them.'
p955
aS'We need to train their security forces to do their jobs to provide security, to do it humanely, respecting the rights of the people.'
p956
aS'More than that, we need to help them provide economic opportunity, security, dignity, in the words of the Arab Spring.'
p957
aS'There will be a role for drones in that next phase of this -- of this long-term combat against al-Qaeda.'
p958
aS'But it will be a more limited, more discriminating role.'
p959
aS'And the policy in the past certainly has not been a failure, and it must adapt to be a success in the future.'
p960
aS"And it's only through a campaign like this, ladies and gentlemen, that I believe that we can turn al-Qaeda into just one more in a long line of terrorist groups that flared up, guttered, and then died, which is where it belongs."
