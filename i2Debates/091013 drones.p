p380
aS'they become fatal to? I will argue, and Ahmed will argue as well they became fatal to'
p381
aS'civilians, more than a few. And they became fatal, I believe, to all of us. In Afghanistan,'
p382
aS'in early 2009, marine general Larry Nicholson and I were in a place called Tagaz, which is'
p383
aS'basically the southern reaches of our area of operation.'
p384
aS'We met a bunch of Marines who were alone and unafraid at the edge of the American'
p385
aS'military empire, overstretched. We all know the story. The next day, in the same'
p386
aS'location, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killed two marines and killed a corpsman. If'
p387
aS'anyone wanted revenge, I did. If anyone wanted revenge, General Larry Nicholson did.'
p388
aS'If anyone wanted revenge, the United States Marine Corps did. Within a few days, we'
p389
aS'identified some suspicious looking guys who were near the area from above. Two drone'
p390
aS'strikes landed a couple hellfire missiles. One of the men was killed right away. The'
p391
aS'other one was split in two. And we all watched as he tried to drag himself into the hole'
p392
aS"from the first strike. He couldn't hide. He bled out. He died. Was it a good guy?"
p393
aS'Absolutely not. But was he found out to be directly tied to the attack? No. That'
p394
aS"happens more than we'd like to admit. The next example is based on a New York Times"
p395
aS'article that just came out on Sunday. You may have read it, but I wanted to be as topical'
p396
aS'and as recent as I could.'
p397
aS'Reportedly 14 Afghans were killed. So I asked a friend of mine, who lives in Kunar, what'
p398
aS'he was hearing. And he quoted a villager who said this: "May Allah give me power for'
p399
aS'one day to use a single drone on the American people so that the American politicians'
p400
aS'understand how much it pains when a missile comes from the sky and kills your relatives'
p401
aS'in front of your eyes, and you can\'t revenge them any more." I\'ve got another quote,'
p402
aS"but I don't have time to get there. In closing, I found a very convincing op-ed by a very"
p403
aS'senior former member of our government, highly experienced, wrote it brilliantly,'
p404
aS'brilliant perspective. And it was titled, "Drones alone are not the answer. And it was a'
p405
aS'New York Times op-ed that came out on August 14th, 2011. He said, "the important'
p406
aS'question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce'
p407
aS"al-Qaeda's capabilities. They will not. And I am pleased that he is on stage with us. It's"
p408
aS'Admiral Blair. And I look forward to hearing more comments based on the argument he'
p409
aS"made in the New York Times. So I'm out of time, but thank you."

S'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and our fellow debaters. On behalf of Admiral'
p436
aS"Blair, it's a privilege to be here to address with you a very, very important topic. And,"
p437
aS"Kael, I would argue that I'm representing the troops in the field tonight. And we can talk"
p438
aS"about the relative advantages. But I think it's important also to address the issue Kael"
p439
aS'mentioned of the strike on Sunday.'
p440
aS"It's important to know that that strike killed the individual who publicly admitted to"
p441
aS'kidnapping Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl of the United States Army who was still the only'
p442
aS'American service person who is incarcerated in Afghanistan today. Now, it may be that'
p443
aS'others were also injured and/or killed in this event. But I would argue that Afghanistan'
p444
aS'is a declared combat zone, ladies and gentlemen. And under the rules of armed conflict,'
p445
aS'that this individual was a legitimate target and clearly a combatant. And he will kidnap'
p446
aS'no more American servicemen.'
p447
aS'But let me go back to a bit more balanced discussion. What I want to do tonight -- and I'
p448
aS'submit, ladies and gentlemen, that the employment of U.S. strike-capable systems is a'
p449
aS'viable and a rational response to a vexing battlefield problem, one that must be'
p450
aS'calibrated, used with care, synced withpolicy. But nonetheless, one that allows us to'
p451
aS'pursue our objectives in a fashion that minimizes loss of life for friendly forces and'
p452
aS'maximizes the opportunity to avoid needless casualties of friendlies; in other words,'
p453
aS'collateral damage.'
p454
aS'Simply remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, permit more considered and more accurate'
p455
aS'and, as a result, more proportionate application of lethal force than any other'
p456
aS'comparable weapon system. Because they can spend longer time over the target than'
p457
aS'equivalent manned aircraft, they give their operators the time to maximize the certainty'
p458
aS'but not necessarily achieve absolute certainty that they are engaging the right enemy'
p459
aS'combatants and that they have the time and the means to confirm the presence of'
p460
aS'noncombatants in the presence of the intended target. Thoughtful observers like our'
p461
aS'partners tonight have mentioned a number of criticisms. Let me talk quickly about a'
p462
aS'couple of them.'
p463
aS'One is that the absence of physical risk to the operator encourages our political'
p464
aS'leadership to use remote systems more often than they would if they had to put'
p465
aS"American troops in harm's way. I would counter by asking whether those who use this"
p466
aS'argument would prefer for the American military to absorb casualties just for the'
p467
aS"purpose of making war less numbing to the political leadership. In addition -- that's a"
p468
aS'tactical level -- is the ability of remote systems to maintain surveillance of target areas'
p469
aS'with remote operators carefully and deliberately evaluating potential targets against the'
p470
aS'criteria that allows them to shoot, that makes this system so discriminating and'
p471
aS'effective.'
p472
aS'Soldiers and airmen under fire on the ground I think you would agree, Kael, are far more'
p473
aS'likely to shoot back at the sources of fire aimed against them, with greater danger to'
p474
aS'noncombatants than are remote operators whose safety and lives are not at immediate'
p475
aS"risk. There's also a concern that nonstate or state actors will use these technologies"
p476
aS'against us in a more crude and indiscriminate fashion than do we. And well, they might.'
p477
aS'But the reality is is that this technology is proliferating, and not because we chose to use'
p478
aS'it. It is a fact of technology advancing. And our lead was and remains significant.'
p479
aS'So, let me go to a quick summary of some data. This goes back to 2011 in Afghanistan'
p480
aS'during the surge period. There are about 150,000 Air Force flights in Afghanistan in'
p481
aS'2011. Sadly, about 3,000 of those flights were medical evacuation sorties of our'
p482
aS'wounded, and our dead. Compare that total to 25,000 close air support sorties and'
p483
aS'support of ground forces, your Marines, of which 1,400 had at least one weapon'
p484
aS'release. So what this means is, is out of 25,000 sorties, 1,400 actually released a'
p485
aS"weapon. There were many sorties that flew with no weapon release at all. That's what"
p486
aS'a professional Air Force does. Ready, finger on the trigger, but extremely careful and'
p487
aS'deliberate about applying lethal force in practice and in principle.'
p488
aS'333 of those 400 weapon releases were by remote systems. Now, I ask you, were those'
p489
aS'releases -- the three quarters of the releases -- from manned aircraft somehow more'
p490
aS'practical, less immoral, less unfair than those 25 percent that were released by'
p491
aS'unmanned aircraft? I think not.'

S"The first thing I think to make clear is that unfortunately drones -- which is -- it's a"
p522
aS"weapon, it's a tool, it's a tactic -- has almost become a strategy in itself, and this is how"
p523
aS'foreign governments and countries where drones are being used see it. All the good of'
p524
aS'U.S. foreign policy, aid, foreign aid, training of security forces, bank loans, et cetera, et'
p525
aS'cetera, all are demolished when at the same time the U.S. uses drones. So in fact'
p526
aS'drones are undermining U.S. foreign policy. They become the only symbol of foreign'
p527
aS'policy which people abroad remember when they are -- when those countries in'
p528
aS'particular are targeted. And some of the countries like Yemen, like Pakistan are in fact'
p529
aS'allies of the United States and drones are being used against allies, naturally that is'
p530
aS'infuriating the population even more.'
p531
aS'Secondly, how badly have drones affected the counterterrorism strategy, the much'
p532
aS'more sophisticated strategy that has emerged from the U.S. in the last few years, where'
p533
aS'the whole strategy is made to protect population, to provide economic incentive,'
p534
aS'development, et cetera. Again, here we see the counterterrorism strategy being'
p535
aS'undermined completely by drones because the people are very scared of them, and'
p536
aS'they do take out civilian targets just as much as they take out al-Qaeda. The other'
p537
aS'question which I think has to be agitating the minds of many Americans is how legal is'
p538
aS'this?'
p539
aS'How legal is it to bomb and kill individuals in another country with which you are not at'
p540
aS"war, with which nothing has been disclosed, there's no transparency involved, nobody is"
p541
aS'informed as to why and how these people are being killed, and often this is, again,'
p542
aS'taking place in countries, you know, that are allies of the U.S. The lack of transparency'
p543
aS'is not helped by the fact that the CIA has been mostly involved in using drones,'
p544
aS"especially in Pakistan. If -- and certainly there's a move now to move some of these"
p545
aS'drone attacks to the defense department, but -- and that could increase transparency,'
p546
aS"but at the moment the CIA's running it and nobody knows how these targets are chosen"
p547
aS'or whether killing these individuals are justified or not. Now, what all this is leading to is'
p548
aS'an enormous buildup of hatred for the United States, and that is not just affecting'
p549
aS'people in the target countries but people all over the Muslim world in particular.'
p550
aS"It's quite shocking to see the figures in Pakistan. One poll puts 74 percent of Pakistanis"
p551
aS'now hate the U.S. more than India, and remember, Pakistan has fought three wars'
p552
aS'against India, and India is the proverbial enemy. Another poll that I just read recently in'
p553
aS"Chicago, yesterday, put it at 94 percent. And here, as I sit, we're talking about a so-"
p554
aS'called ally of the United States.'
p555
aS'Now, what should also be worrying is the precedent that is being set. What happens'
p556
aS'when another country will start using drones? First of all, what happens if a European'
p557
aS'country, or Russia, or a so-called ally of the United States uses drones? What is the U.S.'
p558
aS'strategy going to be? How is that going to affect U.S. foreign policy? Are you going to'
p559
aS'slap that country down? Are you going to tell that country to behave itself and say, "No,'
p560
aS'only we have the right to kill people in other countries. You don\'t have that right."'
p561
aS'Even more dangerous, what happens when an enemy of the United States uses drones?'
p562
aS'What happens if North Korea, tomorrow, uses drones to kill South Koreans? What'
p563
aS'happens if Al-Qaeda itself develops drones? What happens if any -- if the Syrians or any'
p564
aS'of the problematic regimes, dictatorships, start using drones? So, what will be the U.S.'
p565
aS'policy then? Are you going to go and bomb those countries? What is the U.S. strategy'
p566
aS"policy going to be? There's a complete vacuum here. There's no thought being given to"
p567
aS'this. But this could happen tomorrow. Drones now are everywhere. Drones are being'
p568
aS'used for all sorts of other, peaceful projects. And any of those drones can be bought on'
p569
aS'the market and they could be converted into drones that kill people. And I think that'
p570
aS'the idea that somehow, the U.S. is going to have a monopoly over this instrument'
p571
aS'forever is very short-sighted.'
p572
aS'I think the other thing that is -- that I must answer, the issue of civilian casualties. There'
p573
aS'is, for example, a drone strategy now, where drones fire what are called signature'
p574
aS'strikes. That is if a bunch of militants are seen or one or two militants are seen in a'
p575
aS'group of civilians, or sitting in a bus or sitting in a truck, or something like that, drones'
p576
aS'are used -- can be used to kill that militant. But of course, they kill everyone else in the'
p577
aS'truck, too. Women, children, men, civilians. Now, the last drone strike, actually, on'
p578
aS'Sunday, was not the one that the general mentioned, but was one in which 16 civilians'
p579
aS'were killed. And President Karzai just complained to the Americans. And they were'
p580
aS'killed by a drone, because there were a couple of militant guys in the midst of these'
p581
aS'people.'
p582
aS'I think they were in a bus or a truck or something like that. So, the fact is -- I mean, the'
p583
aS'issue of civilian casualties is very controversial. The Americans do not tell us what -- you'
p584
aS'know, how many civilians have been killed. But estimates from other groups put the'
p585
aS"casualties in Pakistan alone somewhere between 500 and 1,000. I mean, that's the level"
p586
aS"of inaccuracy that we have, because we really don't know. These areas are inaccessible"
p587
aS'or -- and the people who would know, certainly, by watching the video screen, the'
p588
aS'drone firer, that kind of information is available. And lastly, I think we have to'
p589
aS'understand how drones have been a recruiting poster for Al-Qaeda and global jihad.'
p590
aS'Even local groups -- local militant groups in countries which have nothing to do with Al-'
p591
aS'Qaeda, nothing to do with global jihad -- if they have been droned, they become global'
p592
aS'jihadists.'
p593
aS'They want to strike back at America. They want to kill Americans. And that is really'
p594
aS'what is very dangerous, that more and more groups who are really fighting local wars'
p595
aS'and conflicts are becoming militarized and wanting to strike back at the United States'
p596
aS'and those other countries.'

p632
aS'drones in areas in which we do not have our troops in action. And Pakistan, of course, is'
p633
aS'the primary example that comes to mind. In fact, probably our motion tonight, "U.S.'
p634
aS'drone program is fatally flawed," is shorthand for "the American drones in Pakistan have'
p635
aS'been a failure." And you\'ve heard from Mr. Rashid some of the objections to that.'
p636
aS'I would tell you that there in fact is no independent drone program. The drones are part'
p637
aS'of a wider strategy which is dedicated to ending the threat from al-Qaeda, a threat with'
p638
aS'which this city is very, very familiar.'
p639
aS'The policy of the drones, a tactic to an end, are to take care of the hard core leaders and'
p640
aS'fighters who are not persuadable, who are not going to change their demonstrated and'
p641
aS'committed intention to kill as many Americans as they can before they -- before they'
p642
aS'can accomplish that. The -- a conflict between a country, the United States, and a non-'
p643
aS"state group like al-Qaeda, is allowed under international humanitarian law. And that's"
p644
aS'what we are involved in. It began here almost 12 years ago, 12 years ago tomorrow. It'
p645
aS"has continued with al-Qaeda's affiliates. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sent a"
p646
aS'bomber to try to kill a bunch of Americans in an airplane over Detroit. TTP, Tehrik-i-'
p647
aS'Taliban in Pakistan, sent Faisal Shahzad a few blocks south of here to Times Square to'
p648
aS'kill a bunch of innocent Americans if he could. We are at war with this group. And the'
p649
aS'leadership of these organizations holed up in places like northwest Pakistan and Yemen,'
p650
aS'places where the governments of our allies, as Mr. Rashid said, do not control their'
p651
aS'territory.'
p652
aS"It's worse in Pakistan. They not only do not control their territory. They give permission"
p653
aS'to the United States to take action where they cannot, and then they blame us for doing'
p654
aS'it, which accounts for a great deal of the sentiment in Pakistan when a dissembling'
p655
aS'hypocritical policy of Pakistani politicians allows them to blame us for actions which'
p656
aS'they themselves permit. But they could stop us from doing it any time. And the'
p657
aS'government in Yemen, by way of contrast, openly cooperates with us and tells its'
p658
aS'people that it does.'
p659
aS'Now, the drones have been successful. We have killed most of the people who planned,'
p660
aS'who directed, and then who gloated over the felling of the Twin Towers, the attack on'
p661
aS'the Pentagon and the aborted attack that ended in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.'
p662
aS'And we have done that not only with drones, but by armed raids, as we saw in Pakistan,'
p663
aS'by a lot of cooperation with other countries and a lot of hard intelligence. So drones'
p664
aS'have played a key role in a successful, but I would argue first phase, of our overall'
p665
aS'campaign against al-Qaeda. But what about the next phase? I think the role of drones'
p666
aS'in the next phase should be much different, not because the program has been a failure,'
p667
aS'but because the situation has changed, and the drones and other tactics have been'
p668
aS'successes. Now the job is to reduce al-Qaeda from a small-scale threat, which is where'
p669
aS'it now is, to a nuisance. And to do that, we have to undercut support for al-Qaeda. We'
p670
aS"have to make sure that Muslim mothers and fathers don't think it's a good idea to send"
p671
aS'their sons and daughters to strap on suicide vests and to kill innocent people around the'
p672
aS'world. Al-Qaeda is doing a wonderful job against itself. It has killed far more Pakistanis,'
p673
aS'far more Muslims than it has Americans and Europeans. But we need to help it further'
p674
aS'along.'
p675
aS'And we must do that by becoming even more selective, even more discriminating, even'
p676
aS'more careful in our use of weapons like drones in the future. And the great bulk of our'
p677
aS'efforts must be dedicated to helping countries like Pakistan, like Yemen, like Mali, like'
p678
aS'the southern Philippines, like Somalia, like Libya, like Afghanistan, to make their lives'
p679
aS'better for their people so that they do not support those who attack the United States'
p680
aS'and their own governments and others. And this means that we need to continue to'
