S'Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Paul Butler, and I'
p267
aS"represent the people. When I was a prosecutor, that's how I would start my opening"
p268
aS'statements. I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and'
p269
aS"tonight I'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure."
p270
aS'Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and'
p271
aS"made us all less free. And he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look"
p272
aS'like. Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine? Nick will tell you about'
p273
aS'the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs. As a'
p274
aS"prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren't making a dent in"
p275
aS'the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe. I was prosecuting a'
p276
aS'lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses. Locking up these young people'
p277
aS'with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing'
p278
aS'school for criminals. When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really'
p279
aS'good bad guys. If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of'
p280
aS'treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer.'
p281
aS"Maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was"
p282
aS"getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that. No"
p283
aS'country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs.'
p284
aS'The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world.'
p285
aS" We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. It"
p286
aS"costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs"
p287
aS'now as it always has been.'
p288
aS'What about drug addicts? It turns out that the small percentage of people who use'
p289
aS'drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than'
p290
aS"punishment for those people. Most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a"
p291
aS"meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might"
p292
aS'be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right?'
p293
aS'If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health'
p294
aS'problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence. But is the answer to'
p295
aS'make using alcohol a crime? Of course not. We tried that during Prohibition and it just'
p296
aS'did not work. All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for'
p297
aS"other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we"
p298
aS"don't stop anybody now from using drugs."
p299
aS"So I'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and"
p300
aS"also, my life experience. Ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on"
p301
aS'drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real. Like most Americans, I have'
p302
aS"used illegal drugs. I wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school"
p303
aS'in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed. The'
p304
aS'first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went'
p305
aS'to college.'
p306
aS"And then at Harvard, where I went to law school. I'm glad I never got caught when I"
p307
aS"smoked pot, and I'm also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for"
p308
aS'any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana. My opponents are honorable'
p309
aS'men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach. As you listen to'
p310
aS"the good doctor Theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind. He has actually"
p311
aS'prescribed heroin to addicts. He did it because he knows that addicts need to be'
p312
aS'treated, not punished. As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is'
p313
aS"a medical issue, not a crime. And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he's a"
p314
aS'wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan. And I wonder'
p315
aS'what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and'
p316
aS'said she was using cocaine.'
p317
aS'Would he really say, "Wait a minute, honey," and whisper to his wife, "Quick, dial 911,'
p318
aS'tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked'
p319
aS'up." Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends.'
p320
aS'So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our'
p321
aS'children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans. We call it a war on drugs'
p322
aS"but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked."
p323
aS' Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession,'
p324
aS"50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino. That's not who really uses drugs. The"
p325
aS"National Institute of Health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any"
p326
aS"other group. They're about 12 percent of drug users."
p327
aS'What about sellers? Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race.'
p328
aS' White kids in Scarsdale, they dont have to go to the hood to buy. They get their weed'
p329
aS'and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale. But who gets locked up'
p330
aS'for drug crimes? Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime,'
p331
aS"60 percent of people who do the time. And that's selective prosecution, and it's"
p332
aS'devastated the African-American community. We have one black president and one'
p333
aS'million black people in prison. The book "The New Jim Crow" tells us that because of'
p334
aS'the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision'
p335
aS'now than there were slaves in 1850. Think about the catastrophic effect that has on'
p336
aS'families. In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing'
p337
aS'time on the outside.'
p338
aS'So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to'
p339
aS'not punish people for using drugs. The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this'
p340
aS'is just a nice rhetorical debate. The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they'
p341
aS'will never be touched by the criminal justice system. The odds for African-American'
p342
aS'children are very different. And that just seems profoundly unfair. My friends, as a'
p343
aS"civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick. We shouldn't put anybody"
p344
aS"in a cage based on what they put in their mouths. There's a better way. It's to legalize"
p345
aS'drugs.'

aS'and cons of the war on drugs. But, quote, "I personally, in my administration, position is'
p380
aS'that legalization is not the answer," end quote. That was President Barack Obama. I'
p381
aS'happen to agree with President Barack Obama.'
p382
aS'I agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce our'
p383
aS'laws. I agree that we need to have a robust debate about incarceration policies and'
p384
aS"what we are doing in our fight against illegal drugs and how much we're devoting to"
p385
aS'rehabilitation. All of those issues are appropriate to be on the table. So there needs to'
p386
aS'be changes. Paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement.'
p387
aS"That's why I have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powder"
p388
aS"cocaine disparity that impacts racially across America. We've reduced that disparity."
p389
aS" We've made a correction to the system. We need to reduce our incarceration rates."
p390
aS" That's why I'm engaged on the Right on Crime initiative and initiatives that encourage"
p391
aS'our state legislatures to look at incarceration policies. And in Texas and in Arkansas and'
p392
aS'in South Carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both to'
p393
aS'save money, but also to reexamine our policies.'
p394
aS"I believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration. That's why I've been a"
p395
aS'supporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that it'
p396
aS'can be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across America. So why --'
p397
aS'why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer? Perhaps he'
p398
aS'understood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that drug'
p399
aS'use has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country. Did he want to preside --'
p400
aS'and I know people -- I see some skeptical looks when I say that. That is in your program.'
p401
aS' That is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years,'
p402
aS'drug use has been cut in half in our country. And we have a president that says he does'
p403
aS'not want to see it go up on his watch.'
p404
aS'Could it be that he does not believe that the United States ought to break its treaty'
p405
aS"obligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe? And that is"
p406
aS'reason enough to vote against the proposition. Or perhaps he was thinking about his'
p407
aS'own daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them to'
p408
aS'be engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in -- whenever we continue to'
p409
aS'have it illegal in our country? And so the president made that decision both personally,'
p410
aS"he said, and with his administration. Let's look at the argument that's been presented."
p411
aS" And first, I would say I've been introduced as a former administrator of the DEA. That is"
p412
aS"absolutely true. I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that's"
p413
aS'prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of'
p414
aS'traffickers.'
p415
aS'And my experience is just the opposite of Paul. In fact, when I went into a store recently'
p416
aS'to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "You put me in prison." I'
p417
aS'thought I was going to be thrown out of the place. But he looked at me, and he said, "I'
p418
aS'wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down the'
p419
aS'wrong path of addiction. I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it'
p420
aS'turned me around." And today he owns his own business. And so I\'ve had a totally'
p421
aS'different experience as former federal prosecutor. They say the current model of'
p422
aS'prohibition is not working. Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does'
p423
aS'not pass muster in close examination. In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years.'
p424
aS'Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed,'
p425
aS'what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty'
p426
aS'today? Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop'
p427
aS'fighting hunger? Of course not.'
p428
aS'Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology. I believe it is an'
p429
aS'effort to save lives. It is our youth. It is our families, it is our communities at stake.'
p430
aS'How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community? Is it by legalization or is it by'
p431
aS"our present method of saying, let's improve the system. Let's make it better. But let's"
p432
aS"don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything"
p433
aS'legal. Secondly, they talk about harm. If you believe that addictive and mind-altering'
p434
aS'drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that'
p435
aS'they are harmful, then ask this question.'
p436
aS'If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs?'
p437
aS"Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate. But if"
p438
aS"you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease"
p439
aS'usage? Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics today'
p440
aS'than you do people who are drug addicts. But did ending prohibition on alcohol'
p441
aS'increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America? And if you'
p442
aS'increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it? They cannot'
p443
aS'show -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and over'
p444
aS'history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go'
p445
aS"down. That has not been the experience in the Netherlands. It's not been the"
p446
aS"experience in the United Kingdom. It's not been the experience in Alaska. It has not"
p447
aS'been the experience in Canada. Usage has gone up.'
p448
aS'And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family. Well, if my'
p449
aS'children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they'
p450
aS'getting those drugs? What is the availability? How can we shut that down? And as a'
p451
aS'parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability,'
p452
aS'increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as'
p453
aS'acceptable in our society as alcohol. That creates a problem as a parent in my mind.'

p516
aS'I do want to point out in all fairness that being among the foremost libertarians in'
p517
aS"America means that myself and my coauthor, you know, that's basically it."
p518
aS"So, you know, you've heard from a self described soldier in the drug war. You've heard"
p519
aS'from a general, a commander, former Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in'
p520
aS"the drug war. You'll hear from a medic in the drug war. I present myself simply as a"
p521
aS'conscientious objector in the war on drugs.'
p522
aS'Let me explain a bit of why I think we should legalize drugs. And the first -- I want to'
p523
aS"make two large points. First is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you"
p524
aS"know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by"
p525
aS'Christmas. This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he\'s saying, "Look,'
p526
aS"you know, it's been working pretty well these past 30 years. Drug use is down. If we get"
p527
aS'rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up." So I want to talk about that. And then I'
p528
aS'want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you. And, first and'
p529
aS'foremost, I want to make this statement. And half of you in this audience, if you are'
p530
aS'representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference.'
p531
aS'You know, using drugs is not immoral. It is not addictive for 99 percent of people. And'
p532
aS"there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it. Look, any program -- it's"
p533
aS"not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's"
p534
aS"kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people. Any program that has"
p535
aS'such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under'
p536
aS'scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions. As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of'
p537
aS'the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which'
p538
aS'looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was'
p539
aS'American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John'
p540
aS'mentioned at the beginning of the program.'
p541
aS'And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo'
p542
aS'for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of'
p543
aS"thousands of people a year in jail are justified. Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you'll"
p544
aS'remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a'
p545
aS"war it doesn't like -- Mark Perry, an economist at AEI, has pointed out that between"
p546
aS'1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for'
p547
aS'inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat. In other words, we have become'
p548
aS"the world's largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes. The only"
p549
aS'other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or'
p550
aS'declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going'
p551
aS'forward.'
p552
aS'Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and'
p553
aS'minds. A recent Rasmussen poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8'
p554
aS"percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs."
p555
aS'A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled'
p556
aS'Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition'
p557
aS"exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate. It doesn't make"
p558
aS'things better, it makes everything worse. Despite attempts to control -- to stem the'
p559
aS'supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation'
p560
aS'adjusted price goes down. As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize'
p561
aS'marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of'
p562
aS'concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders'
p563
aS'while they have to let rapists and murderers out. The Rand Corporation and other think'
p564
aS"tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards"
p565
aS'drugs and use rate.'
p566
aS'So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates. In'
p567
aS"places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates. It's not clear what's"
p568
aS'going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and'
p569
aS'addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more'
p570
aS'willing to come forward before they developed problems.'
p571
aS"So, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the"
p572
aS'failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors,'
p573
aS'also known as the loyal opposition here.'
p574
aS'Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an'
p575
aS"unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America's longest war. I want to make"
p576
aS'a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the'
p577
aS'broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies. And here is'
p578
aS"where I go into the meth round, because I'm running out of time."
p579
aS'This should be recognized. Pharmacological freedom should be recognized as a basic'
p580
aS'right. Over the past several decades, we have become a drug-taking culture, and we all'
p581
aS'believe in what DuPont used to advertise as "better living through chemistry." We take'
p582
aS'drugs to change our cholesterol levels, to change our work habits, to change our moods.'
p583
aS'None of this is going away, nor should it. We do all sorts of things to make ourselves'
p584
aS'look and feel better. To the extent that we might be able to use drugs that are currently'
p585
aS'arbitrarily deemed illicit, not just illegal, but illicit, by the government, the better. Ladies'
p586
aS"and gentlemen, if we don't have the right, literally, to change our mind through our"
p587
aS'personal choices, what rights do we have that are worth a damn? Now, drug'
p588
aS"legalization is not a scary prospect. It's not the radical change that its champions claim"
p589
aS"not its opponents fear. And let me -- as I'm winding down, how many of you have tried"
p590
aS'an illegal drug? Raise your hand.'
p591
aS'Anybody carrying?'
p592

(lp656
S"Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms"
p657
aS'that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their'
p658
aS'illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go'
p659
aS'down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or , or'
p660
aS"methamphetamine, or heroine, or LSD, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms"
p661
aS'would be eliminated and very much reduced. And, incidentally, Portugal has not'
p662
aS'legalized drugs, and no country has. Anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from'
p663
aS'illegality. In this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning'
p664
aS'as from homicide. Those people -- opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs'
p665
aS'obtained perfectly legally. About 15,000 a year die of these drugs. But the supply and'
p666
aS'demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years. And it was all nice'
p667
aS'and above board.'
p668
aS'There are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as I said, created'
p669
aS'perfectly legally. And this is all within a decade, more or less a decade. Now, I suppose'
p670
aS'that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised'
p671
aS'over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is. And if only the drugs were'
p672
aS'really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all'
p673
aS"would be well. Well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that"
p674
aS'proposition. This example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous'
p675
aS'demand. Another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called'
p676
aS'buprenorphine which is used very widely in France in the treatment of heroin addicts.'
p677
aS" And it's diverted to Georgia. That's the ex-Soviet Union republic of Georgia."
p678
aS'According to the Lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the'
p679
aS'population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from France, which again shows quite'
p680
aS'apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the'
p681
aS'first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous'
p682
aS'demand. Our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally'
p683
aS'available in -- to the Georgians, none of this would have happened. In Scotland, as a'
p684
aS'whole, and in Dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone,'
p685
aS'first developed to help the late Hermann Goering to get through the war without'
p686
aS'withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin. And this drug is used in supposed'
p687
aS'treatment of heroin addiction. So the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal'
p688
aS'drug.'
p689
aS"So it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality. We've seen that"
p690
aS'even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in'
p691
aS'drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal'
p692
aS'to deaths from that trade. And that demand was created very, very quickly.'
p693
aS"It's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality"
p694
aS'of drugs. And again, this is not so. In the prison in which I worked, I discovered that the'
p695
aS'heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed -- they had committed'
p696
aS'between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took heroin. Therefore, it will be more'
p697

p737
aS'freedom thing that grownups have the right to put what they want in their own bodies'
p738
aS'as they do with the drug called alcohol. A lesson in history that criminalizing a drug is'
p739
aS'actually going to backfire. But beyond that, they say that the war on drugs, the'
p740
aS'embodiment of drugs as illegal costs in too many ways without a resulting drop in crime'
p741
aS'significantly, and that it disproportionately hits the African-American community in'
p742
aS'terms of people getting locked up behind bars simply for possession of drugs. The team'
p743

aS'cannot say that the war on drugs has failed, not when drug use among Americans has'

aS'to prescription drugs, for example, which are legal. But their use is mired in crime and'

S'Well, ladies and gentlemen, first, let me just remind you that Amsterdam is by far the'
p2265
aS'most violent city in Western Europe, with a murder rate between 2.5 and 3 times higher'
p2266
aS'than that of Paris, for example. And the mayor of Amsterdam recently said that he'
p2267
aS'wanted to reinstate the coffee houses because he had this idea that the one and a half'
p2268
aS'people who go there to take cannabis every year, they would go rampaging through the'
p2269
aS"streets if they couldn't get it. I don't think anyone would have said that about smokers,"
p2270
aS"for example, who couldn't smoke in bars."
p2271
aS"So this suggests that there's a big difference here, a cultural difference. To give you an"
p2272
aS'idea of the -- the Utopianism that is behind this motion, let me tell you that the head of'
p2273
aS'the drug agency of the United Nations once said that the drugs trade was corrupting'
p2274
aS'West Africa. Now, if you can believe that, you can believe anything, because when I'
p2275
aS'arrived in Lagos Airport, the first time I arrived in Lagos Airport, the customs officer said,'
p2276
aS'have you brought any presents? I said, I don\'t know anybody in Nigeria. He said, "For'
p2277
aS'me." And I soon got the general view. Crime is not caused by the illegality of drugs, nor'
p2278
aS'is there illegality that causes the problems to which they give rise. If you vote for this'
p2279
aS"motion, you're saying that the British were the heroes of the opium wars because they"
p2280
aS'opened to the Chinese the freedom to take opium.'
p2281
aS'And which they then did on a famous or notoriously large scale. And they stopped'
p2282
aS'actually when Mao Tse-Tung threatened to shoot them. If you believe that the British'
p2283
aS'were liberating the Chinese, then you will vote for this motion. But remember that'
