aS"I put a lot of people in prison; I was a soldier in the war on drugs, and tonight I'm going to give you a soldier's perspective on why that war is a colossal failure."
p381
aS'Later, Nick will talk about how the war on drugs has compromised our democracy and made us all less free.'
p382
aS"And he'll also talk about what legal regulation of drugs would look like."
p383
aS'Will you be able to go into Whole Foods and buy cocaine?'
p384
aS'Nick will tell you about the experiences of countries all over the world that have safely legalized drugs.'
p385
aS"As a prosecutor, I learned that as many people as I locked up, we weren't making a dent in the drug trade; we were actually making neighborhoods less safe."
p386
aS'I was prosecuting a lot of 19- and 20-year-olds for nonviolent drug offenses.'
p387
aS'Locking up these young people with a bunch of hardcore rapists and murderers was like sending them to finishing school for criminals.'
p388
aS'When these kids came home, they had learned how to be really good bad guys.'
p389
aS'If we legalize drugs, we will stop the counter-productive practice of treating kids the same that we treat violent criminals, and we would all be safer.'
p390
aS"Maybe my work as a prosecutor would've been worth the enormous social cost if it was getting drugs off the street, but we all know the war on drugs doesn't do that."
p391
aS'No country has ever found a way to prevent people from using drugs.'
p392
aS'The United States locks up more people than any country in the history of the world.'
p393
aS"We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners."
p394
aS"It costs us billions of dollars that we just cannot afford, and it's just as easy to get drugs now as it always has been."
p395
aS'What about drug addicts?'
p396
aS'It turns out that the small percentage of people who use drugs who become addicts, we know that treatment is a more effective solution than punishment for those people.'
p397
aS"Most of us are lucky, we don't have a crack head or a meth addict in our family, but everybody's got an alcoholic in the family; tobacco might be a close second, but I think we all agree that alcohol is probably the worst drug, right?"
p398
aS'If you think of it in terms of dysfunctional families, laws, economic productivity, health problems, the people who commit crimes under the influence.'
p399
aS'But is the answer to make using alcohol a crime?'
p400
aS'Of course not.'
p401
aS'We tried that during Prohibition and it just did not work.'
p402
aS"All we did was create this illegal, violent market for liquor just like for other drugs now, and we didn't stop anybody who wanted to, from drinking, just like we don't stop anybody now from using drugs."
p403
aS"So I'm speaking based on my research as a law professor, my work as a prosecutor, and also, my life experience."
p404
aS"Ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot of hypocrisy in the war on drugs, but I want to respect you enough to keep it real."
p405
aS'Like most Americans, I have used illegal drugs.'
p406
aS"I wasn't introduced to them at my all-black public elementary school in Chicago, and at my Catholic high school, a lot more kids drink than smoke weed."
p407
aS'The first time I was around a lot of people who used drugs was actually at Yale, where I went to college.'
p408
aS'And then at Harvard, where I went to law school.'
p409
aS"I'm glad I never got caught when I smoked pot, and I'm also glad that Barack Obama was not arrested and prosecuted for any of the times that he used cocaine and marijuana."
p410
aS'My opponents are honorable men, and it makes me wonder if they really practice what they preach.'
p411
aS"As you listen to the good doctor Theodore, here's one thing you should keep in mind."
p412
aS'He has actually prescribed heroin to addicts.'
p413
aS'He did it because he knows that addicts need to be treated, not punished.'
p414
aS'As a practicing physician, he understood that drug dependency is a medical issue, not a crime.'
p415
aS"And I read a profile of Mr. Hutchinson and he's a wonderful family man; I had the pleasure of meeting his wife, Susan."
p416
aS'And I wonder what a father, a great father like Mr. Hutchinson would say if one his children called and said she was using cocaine.'
p417
aS'Would he really say, "Wait a minute, honey," and whisper to his wife, "Quick, dial 911, tell the police they need to arrest out daughter; she needs to be prosecuted and locked up.'
p418
aS'" Of course not, none of us would do that to our family or friends.'
p419
aS'So my final point, ladies and gentlemen, is, respectfully, what is good enough for our children and our friends is good enough for African-Americans.'
p420
aS"We call it a war on drugs but it's mainly a war on black people; they're the people who get stopped and frisked."
p421
aS'Last year in New York City, 50,000 people got arrested for marijuana possession, 50,000, almost 90 percent were black or Latino.'
p422
aS"That's not who really uses drugs."
p423
aS"The National Institute of Health tells us that black people don't use drugs more than any other group."
p424
aS"They're about 12 percent of drug users."
p425
aS'What about sellers?'
p426
aS'Most drug buyers report buying from someone of their own race.'
p427
aS'White kids in Scarsdale, they dont have to go to the hood to buy.'
p428
aS'They get their weed and Ecstasy and Adderall from other white skids in Scarsdale.'
p429
aS'But who gets locked up for drug crimes?'
p430
aS'Almost two-thirds are black, 12 percent of people who do the crime, 60 percent of people who do the time.'
p431
aS"And that's selective prosecution, and it's devastated the African-American community."
p432
aS'We have one black president and one million black people in prison.'
p433
aS'The book "The New Jim Crow" tells us that because of the war on drugs there are more African-Americans under criminal justice supervision now than there were slaves in 1850.'
p434
aS'Think about the catastrophic effect that has on families.'
p435
aS'In the black community, we have a lot of women and children who are doing time on the outside.'
p436
aS'So, again, the most responsible way to deal with the problems of illegal drug use is to not punish people for using drugs.'
p437
aS'The reality is, for my opponents, this will never -- this is just a nice rhetorical debate.'
p438
aS'The odds are that their children will use drugs, and they will never be touched by the criminal justice system.'
p439
aS'The odds for African-American children are very different.'
p440
aS'And that just seems profoundly unfair.'
p441
aS"My friends, as a civilized society, we shouldn't punish people for being sick."
p442
aS"We shouldn't put anybody in a cage based on what they put in their mouths."
p443
aS"There's a better way."
p444

aS'An African-American whoalso happens to be in a leadership position in the United States attended the summit ofthe Americas in Colombia, South America.'
p544
aS'He said it is okay for us to debate the prosand cons of the war on drugs.'
p545
aS'But, quote, "I personally, in my administration, position isthat legalization is not the answer," end quote.'
p546
aS'That was President Barack Obama.'
p547
aS'Ihappen to agree with President Barack Obama.I agree that there are changes that need to be made as we look at how we enforce ourlaws.'

p549
aS'All of those issues are appropriate to be on the table.'
p550
aS'So there needs tobe changes.'
p551
aS"Paul mentioned that we need to reduce racial disparities in enforcement.That's why I have worked very hard to reduce the cocaine, the crack, and powdercocaine disparity that impacts racially across America."
p552
aS"We've reduced that disparity."
p553
aS"We've made a correction to the system."
p554
aS'We need to reduce our incarceration rates.'
p555
aS"That's why I'm engaged on the Right on Crime initiative and initiatives that encourageour state legislatures to look at incarceration policies."
p556
aS'And in Texas and in Arkansas andin South Carolina, they have reduced the incarceration rates for drug offenders, both tosave money, but also to reexamine our policies.I believe we need to improve alternatives to incarceration.'
p557
aS"That's why I've been asupporter of drug treatment courts that provide accountability with treatment so that itcan be an effective treatment, and it has a great success story across America."
p558
aS'So why --why did the president take the position that legalization is not the answer?'
p559
aS'Perhaps heunderstood the success that we have achieved whenever we look at the fact that druguse has been cut in half over the last 30 years in our country.'
p560
aS'Did he want to preside --and I know people -- I see some skeptical looks when I say that.'
p561
aS'That is in your program.'
p562
aS'That is part of the debate topic and the acknowledgment that, over the last 30 years,drug use has been cut in half in our country.'
p563
aS"And we have a president that says he doesnot want to see it go up on his watch.Could it be that he does not believe that the United States ought to break its treatyobligations in which we've entered into and been a leader across the globe?"
p564
aS'And that isreason enough to vote against the proposition.'
p565
aS'Or perhaps he was thinking about hisown daughters and his grandchildren, and would there be greater potential for them tobe engaged in drug use that he might believe is harmful in -- whenever we continue tohave it illegal in our country?'
p566
aS'And so the president made that decision both personally,he said, and with his administration.'
p567
aS"Let's look at the argument that's been presented."
p568
aS"And first, I would say I've been introduced as a former administrator of the DEA."
p569
aS'That isabsolutely true.'
p570
aS"I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that'sprosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily oftraffickers.And my experience is just the opposite of Paul."
p571
aS'In fact, when I went into a store recentlyto sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "You put me in prison.'
p572
aS'" Ithought I was going to be thrown out of the place.'
p573
aS'But he looked at me, and he said, "Iwanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down thewrong path of addiction.'
p574
aS'I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and itturned me around.'
p575
aS'" And today he owns his own business.'
p576
aS"And so I've had a totallydifferent experience as former federal prosecutor."
p577
aS'They say the current model ofprohibition is not working.'
p578
aS'Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it doesnot pass muster in close examination.'
p579
aS'In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years.Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed,what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated povertytoday?'
p580
aS'Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stopfighting hunger?'
p581
aS'Of course not.Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology.'
p582
aS'I believe it is aneffort to save lives.'
p583
aS'It is our youth.'
p584
aS'It is our families, it is our communities at stake.How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community?'
p585
aS"Is it by legalization or is it byour present method of saying, let's improve the system."
p586
aS"Let's make it better."
p587
aS"But let'sdon't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everythinglegal."
p588
aS'Secondly, they talk about harm.'
p589
aS"If you believe that addictive and mind-alteringdrugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe thatthey are harmful, then ask this question.If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs?Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate."
p590
aS"But ifyou believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decreaseusage?"
p591
aS'Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics todaythan you do people who are drug addicts.'
p592
aS'But did ending prohibition on alcoholincrease or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America?'
p593
aS'And if youincrease drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it?'
p594
aS'They cannotshow -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and overhistory, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to godown.'
p595
aS'That has not been the experience in the Netherlands.'
p596
aS"It's not been theexperience in the United Kingdom."
p597
aS"It's not been the experience in Alaska."
p598
aS'It has notbeen the experience in Canada.'
p599
aS'Usage has gone up.And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family.'
p600
aS'Well, if mychildren came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are theygetting those drugs?'
p601
aS'What is the availability?'
p602
aS'How can we shut that down?'
p603
aS'And as aparent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability,increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just asacceptable in our society as alcohol.'

aS"I'm also a front line prosecutor, a former prosecutor in Arkansas that's prosecuted cocaine cases and marijuana cases and on down the line, primarily of traffickers."
p646
aS'And my experience is just the opposite of Paul.'
p647
aS'In fact, when I went into a store recently to sign up for some exercise, the owner came up and said, "You put me in prison.'
p648
aS'" I thought I was going to be thrown out of the place.'
p649
aS'But he looked at me, and he said, "I wanted to thank you for helping to turn my life around, because I was going down the wrong path of addiction.'
p650
aS'I was going down the wrong path of violation of the law, and it turned me around.'
p651
aS'" And today he owns his own business.'
p652
aS"And so I've had a totally different experience as former federal prosecutor."
p653
aS'They say the current model of prohibition is not working.'
p654
aS'Well, while that might appeal to the popular culture, it does not pass muster in close examination.'
p655
aS'In fact, drug usage is down over the last 30 years.'
p656
aS'Whenever you look at our war on poverty that president Lyndon Johnson proclaimed, what, 30, 35 years ago, whenever he proclaimed that, have we eliminated poverty today?'
p657
aS'Does that mean, because we have not eliminated poverty that we should stop fighting hunger?'
p658
aS'Of course not.'
p659
aS'Well, we call it a war on drugs, which is not my preferred terminology.'
p660
aS'I believe it is an effort to save lives.'
p661
aS'It is our youth.'
p662
aS'It is our families, it is our communities at stake.'
p663
aS'How do you decrease harmful drugs in our community?'
p664
aS"Is it by legalization or is it by our present method of saying, let's improve the system."
p665
aS"Let's make it better."
p666
aS"But let's don't throw it out and say we're going to just turn off the spigot and make everything legal."
p667
aS'Secondly, they talk about harm.'
p668
aS'If you believe that addictive and mind-altering drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine are harmful, if you believe that they are harmful, then ask this question.'
p669
aS'If you legalize, will it increase or decrease the use and the availability of harmful drugs?'
p670
aS"Now, if you believe that they're not harmful, I'm not sure I can win your debate."
p671
aS"But if you believe they're harmful, ask the fundamental question, will it increase or decrease usage?"
p672
aS'Now, Paul made the point that you look at -- you know more alcoholics today than you do people who are drug addicts.'
p673
aS'But did ending prohibition on alcohol increase or decrease alcohol consumption in the United States of America?'
p674
aS'And if you increase drug usage, will it increase drug addiction, harmful reaction to it?'
p675
aS'They cannot show -- and I believe the burden is on them -- they cannot show that logically and over history, that if you decriminalize, if you legalize harmful drugs, the usage is going to go down.'
p676
aS'That has not been the experience in the Netherlands.'
p677
aS"It's not been the experience in the United Kingdom."
p678
aS"It's not been the experience in Alaska."
p679
aS'It has not been the experience in Canada.'
p680
aS'Usage has gone up.'
p681
aS'And so, finally, in my opening, they ask me -- or Paul mentioned my family.'
p682
aS'Well, if my children came to me, and there was a drug issue, my first concern is, where are they getting those drugs?'
p683
aS'What is the availability?'
p684
aS'How can we shut that down?'
p685
aS'And as a parent, it would scare me to death to think that there is going to be easy availability, increased availability and that you can find heroin and methamphetamine just as acceptable in our society as alcohol.'
p686
aS'That creates a problem as a parent in my mind.'

p762
aS"First is, let's look at this war on drugs which is supposedly -- you know, the light is at the end of the tunnel, we're going to bring the troops home by Christmas."
p763
aS'This is what Asa Hutchinson was saying, essentially, when he\'s saying, "Look, you know, it\'s been working pretty well these past 30 years.'
p764
aS'Drug use is down.'
p765
aS'If we get rid of the war on drugs, drug use will go up.'
p766
aS'" So I want to talk about that.'
p767
aS'And then I want to address some of the things that Paul previewed for you.'
p768
aS'And, first and foremost, I want to make this statement.'
p769
aS'And half of you in this audience, if you are representative, are with me in your action in what economists call revealed preference.'
p770
aS'You know, using drugs is not immoral.'
p771
aS'It is not addictive for 99 percent of people.'
p772
aS"And there's nothing wrong with it or to be ashamed about with it."
p773
aS"Look, any program -- it's not a war on drugs, it is a war on racial, ethnic, and age-based minorities, because it's kids who get wrapped up in the war on drugs; it's not old people."
p774
aS'Any program that has such disparate impacts as the ones that Paul was talking about should come under scrutiny regardless of its intentions and its champions.'
p775
aS'As a 2005 cost benefit analysis of the war on drugs, by the super conservative American Enterpriser Institute, which looked at the effectiveness, the conclusion by David Boyum and Peter Reuter was American drug policy has little to show by way of success for that $2.5 trillion that John mentioned at the beginning of the program.'
p776
aS'And they claim it is surely reasonable to ask those who would maintain the status quo for some basis for believing the additional expense and suffering of putting hundreds of thousands of people a year in jail are justified.'
p777
aS"Another AEI scholar -- and AEI, you'll remember it from the Iraq and Afghanistan war, this is a think tank that has never met a war it doesn't like -- Mark Perry, an economist at AEI, has pointed out that between 1970 and 2010 annual spending on drug control has gone up 10 times, adjusted for inflation, while the addiction rate has remained flat."
p778
aS"In other words, we have become the world's largest jailer nation without seriously getting better outcomes."
p779
aS'The only other place where we stand for that kind of massive increase in spending with flat or declining results is public education, which is no model for any kind of program going forward.'
p780
aS'Across every conceivable front, the war on drugs is losing the battle for hearts and minds.'
p781
aS"A recent Rasmussen poll just -- you know, which is a right leaning pollster, 8 percent of people think we're winning the war on drugs."
p782
aS'A century of failure, because it starts with the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act or Controlled Substances Act, has finally woken Americans up to the simple fact that prohibition exacerbates all of the social problems it is supposed to ameliorate.'
p783
aS"It doesn't make things better, it makes everything worse."
p784
aS'Despite attempts to control -- to stem the supply of drugs, the amount and quality of drugs continues to go up while the inflation adjusted price goes down.'
p785
aS'As Washington State and Colorado were voting to legalize marijuana, Californians voted to change its mandatory sentencing laws that grew out of concern about drug crime because its prisons are choked by non-violent drug offenders while they have to let rapists and murderers out.'
p786
aS"The Rand Corporation and other think tanks have found no consistent correlation between a nation's legal regime towards drugs and use rate."
p787
aS'So in some countries you have lax drug laws and high use rates or low use rates.'
p788
aS'In places like America we have stern drug laws and high use rates.'
p789
aS"It's not clear what's going on; we do know in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, that use rates and addiction rates went down, because people got better information and they were more willing to come forward before they developed problems."
p790
aS"So, if you're concerned on the effects of drug use on a society, you should reject the failed policies pursued by often well-meaning, but seriously misinformed drug warriors, also known as the loyal opposition here."
p791
aS"Well, such basic empirical scrutiny alone should convince all observers to consider an unconditional surrender in what is rightly called America's longest war."
p792
aS'I want to make a brief case for what I call pharmacological freedom, or granting adult Americans the broadest possible rights to choose what substances we put into our bodies.'
p793
aS"And here is where I go into the meth round, because I'm running out of time."

S"Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's alleged by the proposers of this motion that the harms that arise from illicit drug taking, production, and distribution arise because of their illegality, and not because of their nature, and that, therefore, if we could only just go down to our local corner store to pick up crack, or , or methamphetamine, or heroine, or LSD, et cetera, whenever we've run out, the harms would be eliminated and very much reduced."
p928
aS'And, incidentally, Portugal has not legalized drugs, and no country has.'
p929
aS'Anyway, it is not so that the harms arise from illegality.'
p930
aS'In this country, about as many people now die annually from opioid poisoning as from homicide.'
p931
aS'Those people -- opioids are overwhelming prescription drugs obtained perfectly legally.'
p932
aS'About 15,000 a year die of these drugs.'
p933
aS'But the supply and demand of them arose suddenly in a matter of a handful of years.'
p934
aS'And it was all nice and above board.'
p935
aS'There are now said to be 2 million addicts to these drugs, and all, as I said, created perfectly legally.'
p936
aS'And this is all within a decade, more or less a decade.'
p937
aS'Now, I suppose that our libertarian opponents would say that the problem here the control exercised over the supply by the mafia, the medical mafia, that is.'
p938
aS'And if only the drugs were really freely available on a truly open market, if only the medical mafia was sidelined, all would be well.'
p939
aS"Well, you can't expect me as a doctor really to agree with that proposition."
p940
aS'This example shows that supply can produce a large and disastrous demand.'
p941
aS'Another example is the diversion on a massive scale of a drug called buprenorphine which is used very widely in France in the treatment of heroin addicts.'
p942
aS"And it's diverted to Georgia."
p943
aS"That's the ex-Soviet Union republic of Georgia."
p944
aS'According to the Lancet, 250,000 people in that country, that is more than 1 in 20 of the population, are now addicted to the drug diverted from France, which again shows quite apart from casting doubt on how badly the addicts needed or wanted the drug in the first place, how a perfectly legal drug can create an enormous sudden and disastrous demand.'
p945
aS'Our opponents would have to allege that had buprenorphine been legally available in -- to the Georgians, none of this would have happened.'
p946
aS'In Scotland, as a whole, and in Dublin, more people are now dying of a perfectly legal drug, methadone, first developed to help the late Hermann Goering to get through the war without withdrawal symptoms from heroin, then from heroin.'
p947
aS'And this drug is used in supposed treatment of heroin addiction.'
p948
aS'So the legal drug is now killing more than the illegal drug.'
p949
aS"So it's not true that the harms of drugs arise only from their illegality."
p950
aS"We've seen that even if ever homicide in this country, every single one, with a result of the illicit trade in drugs, which is an absurd proposition, deaths from legally obtained opioids would equal to deaths from that trade."
p951
aS'And that demand was created very, very quickly.'
p952
aS"It's also alleged by the proposals that criminality is caused, more or less, by the illegality of drugs."
p953
aS'And again, this is not so.'
p954
aS'In the prison in which I worked, I discovered that the heroin addicts who were imprisoned there and had committed -- they had committed between 50 and 200 offenses before they ever took heroin.'
p955
aS'Therefore, it will be more true to say that they were addicts because they were criminal than that they were criminal because they were addicts.'
p956
aS'This has been found elsewhere.'
p957
aS'And research shows that criminality is a better predictor of addiction than is addiction of criminality.'
p958
aS'And this can be seen from the career of the writer William S. Burroughs, with which you might be familiar, who, as you know, shot his wife dead.'
p959
aS'He -- in my opinion, he was an even worse writer than he was a husband.'
p960
aS"But we don't have any time for literary criticism."
p961
aS'The point is that he was fascinated by crime and committed criminal acts well before he became an addict.'
p962
aS'In the hospital in which I worked, I once walked into the intensive care unit to find two drug dealers who had shot each other at close quarters, but with thorough British incompetence, had failed to kill one another.'
p963
aS'Well, what do you suppose that such people would be doing if they were not shooting at one another?'
p964
aS'Would they have been doing remedial teaching, for example, or deciphering cuneiform script in the British museum?'
p965
aS"It's absurd."
p966
aS'And criminal -- criminal gangs are not going to file for bankruptcy if drugs are legalized.'
p967
aS"They're going to change their activities."
p968
aS'So making the importation or production, distribution, and sale of drugs would be dangerous, and it would not have the claimed benefits because the illegality of drugs is the occasion and not the cause of crime.'
p969
aS'And therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote against the motion.'

S'Well, ladies and gentlemen, first, let me just remind you that Amsterdam is by far the most violent city in Western Europe, with a murder rate between 2.5 and 3 times higher than that of Paris, for example.'
p3233
aS"And the mayor of Amsterdam recently said that he wanted to reinstate the coffee houses because he had this idea that the one and a half people who go there to take cannabis every year, they would go rampaging through the streets if they couldn't get it."
p3234
aS"I don't think anyone would have said that about smokers, for example, who couldn't smoke in bars."
p3235
aS"So this suggests that there's a big difference here, a cultural difference."
p3236
aS'To give you an idea of the -- the Utopianism that is behind this motion, let me tell you that the head of the drug agency of the United Nations once said that the drugs trade was corrupting West Africa.'

aS"If you vote for this motion, you're saying that the British were the heroes of the opium wars because they opened to the Chinese the freedom to take opium."
p3243
aS'And which they then did on a famous or notoriously large scale.'
p3244
aS'And they stopped actually when Mao Tse-Tung threatened to shoot them.'
p3245
aS'If you believe that the British were liberating the Chinese, then you will vote for this motion.'
