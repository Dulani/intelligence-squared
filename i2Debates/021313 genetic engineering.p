S'What Robert Rosenkranz really said in this debate, very often we do debates where'
p33
aS"things divide very clearly, policy issues where it's yes or no, where it's black or white. It"
p34
aS'was his feeling that this is one debate where the richness of the debate actually comes'
p35
aS'from the fact that there are an awful lot of shades of gray and shades of meaning in the'
p36
aS"issue, that black and white and yes or no, even though we're asking you to vote at that"
p37
aS"level, it's very complicated. And so he was looking forward to this being, in a sense, one"
p38
aS'of the more complex debates that we were going to have and have ever staged. So with'
p39
aS"that thought, let's please welcome our debaters to the stage."
p40
aS"Thank you. Thank you. And because we're being broadcast for radio and television,"
p41
aS'there are various points throughout the evening where we like the radio audience in'
p42
aS'particular to know that you, our live audience, are here. So you can absolutely give'
p43
aS"voice. This is not like a presidential debate where you're not allowed to applaud. You"
p44
aS'can give voice to your passions in this. You can laugh, cheer, react however you want'
p45
aS'to. We just want it to not be mean spirited. We discourage you from hissing, for'
p46
aS"example. But -- but a chuckle like that is fine. And here and there, again, I'm just going"
p47
aS'to ask you to applaud entirely spontaneously, but it has to be when I ask you.'
p48
aS'To work for the radio broadcast. And when I introduce, in a moment, each of our'
p49

p50
aS"please welcome these -- these debaters with a round of applause. But let's just begin"
p51
aS'the whole thing, please. Welcome them to the stage one more time.'
p52
aS'So most of us would do almost anything for our kids to help them be their best, to help'
p53
aS'them get ahead. But what if even before they were born we could go in and alter their'
p54
aS'genes in such a way to give them an even greater advantage, to give them strength'
p55
aS'against illness and disease, to make them smarter or taller or prettier even if their'
p56
aS"parents themselves never had any of those traits. Well, that world is coming. Who's"
p57
aS"tempted? And who is horrified? Let's find out."
p58
aS'Yes or no to this statement: Prohibit genetically engineered babies. A debate from'
p59
aS'qualified debaters you see on the stage argue for and against this motion, two against'
p60
aS'two: prohibit genetically engineered babies. As always, our debate goes in three'

S'Thank you. Thank you very much. The proposition before us today, to me means'
p259
aS'prenatal genetic modification of human reproductive cells, like sperm or eggs or'
p260
aS'fertilized eggs, called the zygote, in preparation for gestation in the womb and'
p261
aS'development to full term infants should be prohibited at the societal level, and to this I'
p262
aS'agree firmly.'
p263
aS'The two basic reasons to carry out such an intervention: one, for curing or preventing'
p264
aS'genetic disease; or, two, for the enhancement of a person. For genetic diseases, in the'
p265
aS'great majority of cases there are simpler, less risky, less costly, less ethically'
p266
aS'controversial, and more dependable methods of preventing the birth of a child with a'
p267
aS'severe genetic abnormality by using prenatal embryo diagnosis; that is, for diagnosing'
p268
aS'the embryos. There are a couple of exceptions, which I think we will get to during this'
p269
aS"debate, such as mitochondrial disease. And we'll have more to say about that later."
p270
aS' Other than the exception, the only sensible rationale for engaging in genetic'
p271
aS'modification of the fertilized egg is for the enhancement of a child. Enhancement might'
p272
aS'include intelligence, resistance to disease, greater height, muscle strength, appealing'
p273
aS'personality, longevity, any number of things you could imagine.'
p274
aS'Now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive'
p275
aS'cells, for enhancement is where I find the greatest moral failure and the greatest'
p276
aS'scientific folly. I offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only'
p277
aS'method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial'
p278
aS'where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of'
p279
aS'them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their'
p280
aS'lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their'
p281
aS'health. No set of animal studies can ensure the safety and efficacy of human prenatal'
p282
aS'genetic modification. It is unimaginable that any humane, democratic society would'
p283
aS'permit such a trial with public or private funds; the risk would so outweigh the societal'
p284
aS'benefits.'
p285
aS'My distinguished colleague, professor Winston, will address some of the risks,'
p286
aS'complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early'
p287
aS'embryo. Of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done'
p288
aS'outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and'
p289
aS'knowledge gained are of no concern. So that certainly can always happen. This takes us'
p290
aS'to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for'
p291
aS'enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits'
p292
aS'under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two.'
p293
aS'Traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and -- are complex and'
p294
aS'not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social'
p295
aS'and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the DNA and the gene-'
p296
aS'gene interactions that occur in human cells. Scientists and the so-called trans-'
p297
aS'humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a Lego set,'
p298
aS'where pieces of DNA can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of'
p299
aS'the system. Actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts'
p300
aS'interrelate and are in mutual balance.'
p301
aS'Even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50'
p302
aS'genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples. So there'
p303
aS'could be hundreds of genes associated with height. If you want a child, a tall child,'
p304
aS'marry tall.'
p305
aS'Finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human'
p306
aS'perfection can be directed by genetics. The danger is not so much that it will work, but'
p307
aS'as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and'
p308
aS'resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you'
p309
aS'better.'
p310
aS'It would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a Nobel laureate will give you'
p311
aS'a genius child. I am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is'
p312
aS'fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing'
p313
aS'postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral'
p314
aS"education. Enhancement through genetic engineering of human germ plasm is a fool's"
p315
aS'paradise and will lead to no good. Thank you.'

p343

p344
aS"am here tonight to represent my personal views, and not the President's Commission on"
p345
aS'Bioethics of which I am a member, about why we should not prohibit genetically'
p346
aS"engineered babies. In a little while, you'll hear from my debate partner, Lee Silver, who"
p347
aS'will debunk many of the scientific claims against genetic engineering. But first I want to'
p348
aS'convince of you two things: that we already can and have safely genetically engineered'
p349
aS'babies and that a middle ground of prudent vigilance, public oversight and debate about'
p350
aS'genetic engineering is better than prohibition.'
p351
aS'I also want to call your attention to the resolution this evening. It calls for an outright'
p352
aS'and complete ban on genetic engineering of babies. If Lee and I can convince you of any'
p353
aS'instance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should vote'
p354
aS"against the resolution. Throughout the evening, I'll defend why genetic engineering is"
p355
aS'no different in kind from the many ways that we already engineer our children, from the'
p356
aS'partners we choose to prenatal screening to the supplements we take that impact our'
p357
aS'children and their fates. Recently new research shows the powerful effect of taking'
p358
aS'folate during pregnancy and how it reduces the incidence of autism in children. And yet'
p359
aS'no one thinks that we should ban folate. But I want to convince you that we already can'
p360
aS'and have taken the next step of genetic engineering of babies and that we would take a'
p361
aS'drastic step backwards to ban outright that technology.'
p362
aS"I'm going to tell you about inherited mitochondrial disorders, which are progressive and"
p363
aS'cause tragic health consequences. A little biology 101 should help frame the debate.'
p364
aS'About 98 percent of your DNA is nuclear DNA. It codes for much of who you are. But'
p365
aS'about 2 percent of your DNA is mitochondrial which supplies the energy to your cells.'
p366
aS'To understand this, visualize a cell with its small nucleus and a little bundle inside of the'
p367
aS'cell and the mitochondrial DNA and the fluid that surrounds it. The nucleus of the cell is'
p368
aS'where 99.9 percent of the action is, but only in the mitochondria functions properly.'
p369
aS'About one in 5,000 babies born have problems with their mitochondrial DNA that cause'
p370
aS'rare but incredibly serious disease, including heart failure, dementia, blindness, severe'
p371
aS'suffering and death. There is no way to treat the condition once it is acquired, and it is'
p372
aS'extremely difficult to predict how severely a child will be affected. With genetic'
p373
aS'engineering of babies, we can altogether avoid this suffering.'
p374
aS'Professors Winston and Krimsky will argue that we can just screen out and abort the'
p375
aS'defective fetuses or destroy the embryos in the lab. But mitochondrial DNA, which is'
p376
aS'solely inherited from the mother, is often passed on to every child of an afflicted'
p377
aS'mother. Only genetic engineering can safeguard a woman against these difficult choices'
p378
aS'and altogether eliminate the risk of a child being born with mitochondrial disease. Take,'
p379
aS'for example, Sharon, a woman who had a healthy pregnancy and who gave birth to a'
p380
aS'beautiful, healthy girl. Twenty-eight hours later, that baby died of an unknown disease.'
p381
aS"This tragic tale repeated itself five times as each of Sharon's babies lived for just a few"
p382
aS'hours. Only her son, Edward survived. And by age four, he started falling over'
p383
aS"repeatedly. He'll spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair with little control over his"
p384
aS'muscles.'
p385
aS"You see, Sharon has Lee's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease, and she passed it on"
p386
aS'to all six of her children. The only way that Sharon or any woman with a high level of'
p387
aS'mitochondrial abnormality will have her own healthy genetic children is through genetic'
p388
aS"engineering of the babies. We'll talk about two techniques to do so: Pronuclear"
p389
aS'transfer and maternal spindle transfer that safely eliminate the risk of these diseases.'
p390
aS' At least 30 children have already been born in the United States using an earlier version'
p391
aS'of mitochondrial transfer. All of these children were born free of mitochondrial disease.'
p392
aS'And these newer techniques have even fewer risks than those earlier ones and promise'
p393
aS'even better outcomes for future generations.'
p394
aS'The United Kingdom, notoriously conservative about reproductive technologies, has'
p395
aS'given the green light in the use of these technologies. A ban by the U.S. would make us'
p396
aS'an outlier, a country standing in the way of scientific progress, at odds with the scientific'
p397
aS'and ethical consensus that mitochondrial transfer, a form of genetic engineering of'
p398
aS'babies, is permissible. But mitochondrial genetic engineering proves my larger point'
p399
aS'that I want to convince you of this evening, that a middle ground approach is better'
p400
aS"than an outright ban. You'll hear my opponents talking about opening floodgates to a"
p401
aS'dystopia of designing perfect babies. But technology itself is not evil. Only misuse and'
p402
aS'misapplication of it is. The public can and should decide what limits if any there should'
p403
aS'be on the uses of genetic engineering. But a complete ban would just drive the practice'
p404
aS'into back alleys or overseas. Criminalizing genetic engineering will make the practice'
p405
aS'hidden from public view so that we will have no idea whether Sharon and women like'
p406
aS'her are using unsafe and unsavory practitioners to carry out genetic engineering.'
p407
aS'Reproductive tourism is already rampant, where women and couples are traveling to'
p408
aS'foreign countries to gain access to reproductive technologies banned in their own'
p409
aS"countries. You can be sure that women like Sharon, afflicted with terrible Lee's"
p410
aS'syndrome, will travel great distances to safeguard their children. Now imagine just for a'
p411
aS'moment how we would enforce the outright ban that the resolution calls for. Would we'
p412
aS'forcibly genetically test all babies? Would they -- would the government appear in'
p413
aS"Sharon's hospital room or at airports with handcuffs to arrest her or her child? Would"
p414
aS'we forcibly sterilize Sharon and her baby? Is this the kind of society that you want to'
p415
aS'live in? Some of the worst examples of abuses of government power in the last century'
p416
aS'have involved the government trying to control our reproduction. This grim history of'
p417
aS'eugenics and of laws against interracial marriage, of programs of forced sterilization and'
p418
aS'abortion, provide a strong reason to reject the resolution.'
p419
aS"We aren't here to defend every type of genetic engineering. We're here to urge you to"
p420
aS'vote in favor of a middle ground, to allow parents and private citizens to make private'
p421
aS'choices about one of the most intimate decisions they will ever make, to bring a healthy'
p422
aS'child into the world.'

p499
aS'which is a remarkable landmark. Ladies and gentlemen, this is actually quite a simple'
p500
aS"proposition. And it's quite clear that what our opponents are recommending is"
p501
aS'something which Americans shiver at, which is experimentation without the consent of'
p502
aS'the individual being experimented upon.'
p503
aS"It's worth looking very briefly at American history. The history of eugenics, which"
p504
aS'started probably in Britain, with Francis Galton back in the 1850s, is still a scar to some'
p505
aS'extent on genetics. And Davenport, of course, and other people who followed him, I'
p506
aS'think, had a great deal of responsibility for the sterilization of women without consent,'
p507
aS'with the prevention of people who might want to make love together because they'
p508
aS'were different races were prevented by law in many states in the United States. And'
p509
aS'this is something, of course, which directly influenced the Nazi holocaust.'
p510
aS"And although it may seem farfetched, it's worth bearing in mind that the time when the"
p511
aS'planet is oppressed by the risk of global warming, and by the risk of conflict, by the risk'
p512
aS'of all sorts of serious issues on the economy, it may well be that people might want to'
p513
aS'see eugenics raising its ugly head again. And the United States, in my view, as the'
p514
aS'leading biotechnological country in the world, has a major responsibility to lead it in this'
p515
aS'ethical issue. Now, as my partner has said, there are two concerns here. One is genetic'
p516
aS'engineering to change horrific genes such as these are mentioned, and the other, of'
p517
aS'course, is to enhance individuals. The problem, of course, is that once you go from one,'
p518
aS"I think you go to the other as well. And mitochondrial disease, let's just knock that on"
p519
aS"the head straightaway. Mitochondrial disease, although it's a terrible thing to have, it is"
p520
aS"really trivial in terms of its incidence. It's a very, very uncommon disorder."
p521
aS"And it is worrying to me that our opponents have got the numbers wrong. It isn't 2"
p522
aS"percent of the DNA, it's 16,000 base pairs out 3 billion base pairs. So it's a tiny amount"
p523
aS'of DNA, but we know already that even fiddling with the mitochondria may make a'
p524
aS"massive difference to what happens to the nuclear DNA. It's still not clear. And it's"
p525
aS'worth bearing in mind that abnormal children have been born as a result of'
p526
aS'mitochondrial transfer. This has been completely unpredictable. Now, with regard to'
p527
aS'one of the issues about genetic engineering for enhancement, it will be permanent, it'
p528
aS'will be irreversible, and it may impart values to a child that, that child might find is not'
p529
aS'valuable in the society in which they are growing up. And, of course, with regard to'
p530
aS'disease, it is quite clear that screening embryos is a much better bet.'
p531
aS'If we take a cell away or the look at the biochemistry of an embryo, which you can now'
p532
aS'do, and detect the disease, we can simply substitute that embryo for another one in a'
p533
aS"clutch of eggs because, of course, a woman -- it's worth bearing in mind that the"
p534
aS'average childbearing woman watching this program will lose two eggs during the course'
p535
aS'of the program, each genetically unique. The males, meanwhile, have made some'
p536
aS'70,000 new sperm. Each of those are equally genetically unique, an every embryo is'
p537
aS'different. And therefore, to screen embryos which have a clear disease, by the'
p538
aS'techniques which are now being developed, is certainly possible and much safer than'
p539
aS'meddling with the genome.'
p540
aS'And, of course, what we have to understand is that we now know that the'
p541
aS'environmental influence on the embryo, the environmental influence on the fetus has a'
p542
aS'massive point, has a massive change, in how it grows up. And, in fact, really, what we'
p543
aS'should be trying to do -- rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what we'
p544
aS'should be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the DNA functions in the'
p545
aS'best possible way.'
p546
aS'There is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, the'
p547
aS'intelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stress'
p548
aS'hormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning. And that is something which'
p549
aS'we should really recognize in a democratic society as something that science should'
p550
aS'really concentrate on.'
p551
aS"Now, the big problem of course is that genetic engineering is unpredictable. And I'm"
p552
aS'going to give you two examples from the two biggest users of people who make'
p553
aS'genetically modified animals. The most common place for genetically modified animals,'
p554
aS'of course, is in the pharmaceutical industry. Pretty well every drug is now tested --'
p555
aS'nearly every drug will be tested on animals, where their genes have been modified to'
p556
aS'make a model for human disease or to look at the action of that drug. And if you look at'
p557
aS'the figures which are being published by two of the largest companies in the world, with'
p558
aS"very large series of mass models, you can see the problem you'd have with genetic"
p559
aS'engineering.'
p560
aS'AstraZeneca published 51 different models, a vast number of mice in those models, 70'
p561
aS'percent, ladies and gentlemen, of those animals were abnormal and the abnormality'
p562
aS'was unpredictable. Some of the abnormalities were trivial, others were not. The'
p563
aS"animals were not followed up for long term, they were simply discarded, so we don't"
p564
aS'know what would have happened to -- in old age. We do know that changing genetics'
p565
aS'makes a difference to what happens to us in our old age, and certainly the fetal origins'
p566
aS'of adult disease are very important. We know, for example, that stroke, diabetes, some'
p567
aS'cancers, may be caused by what happens in the environment of an embryo early on.'
p568
aS"And Pfizer has gone even further. It's looked at 74 different tests on mice that are bred"
p569
aS'after genetic modification, and 50 percent of the mice failed the phenotype test. And'
p570
aS'this is without, of course, testing the very things for which we would want to enhance'
p571
aS'people, i.e., intelligence and their ability to solve a problem.'
p572
aS"So let's just say one other thing, if I may, and that is that one of the problems, of course,"
p573
aS"is that one may modify genes, but we don't even know whether they will continue to"
p574
aS'function in the way. And there is a lot of evidence from the work we do in my own'
p575
aS'laboratory, which shows that gene expression in a modified animal stops after a while'
p576
aS'during development. Ladies and gentlemen, as I say, you have a responsibility here.'
p577
aS'You have a duty to lead the world to make certain that your medicine is ethical. Thank'
p578

S'Thank you. The proposition this evening is "prohibit genetically engineered babies."'
p611
aS'Prohibit even if the purpose is to promote health; prohibit even if the recipients'
p612
aS"understand precisely the actual risk; prohibit even if it's safe; prohibit even if the"
p613
aS'technology is safer than doing nothing. I just need to convince you of one example of'
p614
aS'acceptability and you should vote to oppose the proposition. And my colleague has'
p615
aS"already talked very eloquently about mitochondrial DNA deficiency, and I'm going to go"
p616
aS'beyond that, because I hope to convince my opponents here to vote for my side of this'
p617
aS'proposition.'
p618
aS"They've both written and talked quite eloquently about the use of genetics to prevent"
p619
aS'disease. So what are we talking about here tonight when we talk about genetic'
p620
aS"engineering? Conceptually, it's very simple: genetic engineering will allow perspective"
p621
aS"parents to give their child genetic information that they themselves do not carry. That's"
p622
aS"how genetic engineering will first be used, not soon, but that's the way it's first going to"
p623
aS'be applied.'
p624
aS'And to understand what parents might want to give their children, we should examine'
p625
aS'the facts of genetics that have become available to us over the last five to ten years,'
p626
aS'have given us a very different perspective on the human genome than we had'
p627
aS'previously. And it revealed some unpleasant facts. I want you to look at the person'
p628
aS"sitting to the right of you. And if there's no one on the right, look at the person sitting"
p629
aS'to the left. That person and you differ at over a million locations in your DNA. Most of'
p630
aS"those differences don't do anything. But even if you're a healthy adult, at least 100 of"
p631
aS'those genetic variance can cause deadly childhood disease. Not in you, of course,'
p632
aS"because you're sitting in the audience. But in your grandchildren or their grandchildren."
p633
aS'You carry thousands of other genetic variants, every one of you in this room, that'
p634
aS'impact your health and risk to thousands of diseases in different ways, including cancer'
p635
aS'and heart disease and neurological disease. And some of the variants that you carry are'
p636
aS'better than those of your neighbor to the right. Some are worse than those of your'
p637
aS'neighbor. And all in all, some of us are born with better health genes, and some are not.'
p638
aS'Now, if you have made a decision, you or a daughter, granddaughter, have made a'
p639
aS'decision to have a child, what do you hope for the most in that child? And Dr. Winston'
p640
aS'has spoken eloquently to this question many, many times.'
p641
aS"You hope for a healthy child. You'll love any child, but you hope for a healthy child. And"
p642
aS'Dr. Winston has also said, and I agree, in pluralistic societies like yours and mine, genetic'
p643
aS'selection against diseased embryos is a matter for the individuals concerned. If you'
p644
aS'agree with Dr. Winston on this point, it follows that you should be willing to accept'
p645
aS'genetic engineering when needed to accomplish the same goal.'
p646
aS"But, you might worry, doesn't this violate Mother Nature? Well, I'm here to tell you that"
p647
aS"Mother Nature doesn't care at all about you or your baby. Throughout the history of"
p648
aS'the human species, Mother Nature has engaged in all-out warfare against us with'
p649
aS"infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. And it's only in the last century that"
p650
aS'we gained the knowledge and power to fight back with vaccines and antibiotics and'
p651
aS'other medicines.'
p652
aS'Now, do some people abuse pharmaceutical drugs? Of course there is abuse out there.'
p653
aS"But that doesn't mean that we should prohibit medicine. With infectious diseases"
p654
aS'essentially vanquished in our society, although not everywhere in the world, the next'
p655
aS"target in our sights is Mother Nature's genetic wrath. Unfortunately, if you're in the"
p656
aS"audience, it's too late to do anything about the genome and the hundreds of trillions of"
p657
aS'cells in your body. But we can think about the future. You can think about your'
p658
aS"children's children and their children's children, because the expansive amount of"
p659
aS'knowledge we are gaining about the genome has flabbergasted even those of us who'
p660
aS'are most optimistic about this science.'
p661
aS"So let's think about the next generation or the generation after that. Now, Mother"
p662
aS"Nature is a metaphor, and it's a really bad metaphor because in reality, inheritance is a"
p663
aS'game of craps.'
p664
aS"You throw the dice, you hold your breath, you hope your child is healthy. It won't have"
p665
aS'to be that way in the future when we learn how to take the genetic dice, place them on'
p666
aS'the table in the way that is going to promote health most likely for the child to be.'
p667
aS"What about the risks? We've heard about the risks from both of the proponents of this"
p668
aS"proposition, the precautionary principle is often mentioned. You shouldn't deploy a"
p669
aS"technology until all of the unknowable risks are known. And we can't possibly"
p670
aS'understand how genes work because the whole system of life is very complex. And if'
p671
aS'we put a new gene in, it might have unattended consequences. And I agree with the'
p672
aS"proponents of the proposition. We don't understand genetics. It's very complex, and"
p673
aS"it's more complex the more we understand it."
p674
aS'But what society and people can do in the future is consider genetic information that'
p675
aS'already exists in some people but not others. I want to focus your mind on the fact, as I'
p676
aS'said a moment ago, we all carry thousands of genetic variants, some of which are'
p677
aS'promoting health and some of which are not. And even if a variant is in just 1 percent of'
p678
aS'the population out there, we can study the effects of that genetic variant in the people'
p679
aS'who carry that variant. And we can see the benefits or not of that variant. So the'
p680
aS'precautionary principle is not in effect here.'
p681
aS"I want to conclude that if you are thinking about voting for this proposition, you'll need"
p682
aS'to explain why you did so when your daughter or granddaughter comes to you with the'
p683
aS'following question: "Dad, grandpa, why can\'t I give my child health-promoting, disease-'
p684
aS'preventing genes that other children get naturally?" If you can\'t answer that question,'
p685
aS'you must vote no on this proposition.'

p2377
aS"really not at issue here. There's a big issue for the whole of our society and for people in"
p2378
aS"general. I regret to say that I'm saddened to see the simplistic argument about"
p2379
aS"mitochondrial DNA from the other side. We don't understand the interactions with the"
p2380
aS"mitochondria. And already we've seen a number of horrid mishaps. So, of course,"
p2381
aS'maybe a particular individual was lucky, but they might have been unlucky. How'
p2382
aS'different we would have been then. We heard that people have a right to have a'
p2383
aS"healthy child. Of course, they don't have a right, sadly, to have a healthy child. What"
p2384
aS'we do have a right to, though, in a democratic society, surely, is to have access to the'
p2385
aS'best and the safest treatment. And at the moment, the safest treatment is certainly not'
p2386
aS'meddling with the genome. It is not meddling with the mitochondrial DNA.'
p2387
aS"It is actually to look at every other way of dealing with these terrible diseases. We're"

aS"always be lifted if there's more research done to show that it is worth doing. And it's"
p2390
aS"worth bearing in mind too that we're not going to eradicate genetic defects by doing"
p2391
aS'this, not remotely. New defects occur all the time as Lee Silver rightly points out. All of'
p2392
aS'us have defective DNA. 30 percent of boys born with the male form of muscular'
p2393
aS'dystrophy have this as a new mutation, as he well knows. No amount of pre-'
p2394
aS'implantation diagnosis will have changed that. It is a particular problem. And that is'
