p32
aS"It was his feeling that this is one debate where the richness of the debate actually comes from the fact that there are an awful lot of shades of gray and shades of meaning in the issue, that black and white and yes or no, even though we're asking you to vote at that level, it's very complicated."

p355

p358
aS'Now, engaging in genetic modification of human gametes, the human reproductive cells, for enhancement is where I find the greatest moral failure and the greatest scientific folly.'
p359
aS'I offer three reasons: first, whatever enhancement is sought, the only method for determining whether it would work would be to engage in a clinical trial where you would have dozens of fertilized eggs or embryos, genetically modify half of them, carry them all to term, follow the development of the children throughout their lives to determine whether the intervention worked and at what expense to their health.'

aS'My distinguished colleague, professor Winston, will address some of the risks, complexities, and uncertainties with procedures using a genetic scalpel in the early embryo.'
p363
aS'Of course, the genetic modification of a single fertilized egg can be done outside of civil society, at some island community, where evidence of success, risks, and knowledge gained are of no concern.'
p364
aS'So that certainly can always happen.'
p365
aS'This takes us to the second reason that babies should not be genetically engineered for enhancement: from a biological and developmental standpoint, the so-called traits under consideration cannot remotely be enhanced by the modification of a gene or two.'
p366
aS'Traits like intelligence, personality, muscle tone, musicianship and -- are complex and not only involve dozens if not hundreds of genes but are the result of nutrition, social and environmental factors, genetic switches that are outside of the DNA and the gene- gene interactions that occur in human cells.'
p367
aS'Scientists and the so-called trans- humanists who believe that it is possible think of the human genome as a Lego set, where pieces of DNA can be plugged in or out without interfering with the other parts of the system.'
p368
aS'Actually, the human genome is more like an ecosystem where all the parts interrelate and are in mutual balance.'
p369
aS'Even for height, one of the most heritable traits known, scientists have found at least 50 genes that can account for only 2 to 3 percent of the variance of the samples.'
p370
aS'So there could be hundreds of genes associated with height.'
p371
aS'If you want a child, a tall child, marry tall.'
p372
aS'Finally, the idea of genetic enhancement grows out of a eugenic ideology that human perfection can be directed by genetics.'
p373
aS'The danger is not so much that it will work, but as a myth, it will have social power that can be used by those who have wealth and resources to make others believe that to be prenatally genetically modified makes you better.'
p374
aS'It would be as much a myth as believing that the sperm of a Nobel laureate will give you a genius child.'
p375
aS'I am all for human enhancement, but it must start after an egg is fertilized, beginning in utero by protecting the fetus from toxic chemicals and continuing postnatally through environmental, nutritional and cognitive enhancement and moral education.'

p435
aS"Iam here tonight to represent my personal views, and not the President's Commission onBioethics of which I am a member, about why we should not prohibit geneticallyengineered babies."
p436
aS"In a little while, you'll hear from my debate partner, Lee Silver, whowill debunk many of the scientific claims against genetic engineering."
p437
aS'But first I want toconvince of you two things: that we already can and have safely genetically engineeredbabies and that a middle ground of prudent vigilance, public oversight and debate aboutgenetic engineering is better than prohibition.I also want to call your attention to the resolution this evening.'
p438
aS'It calls for an outrightand complete ban on genetic engineering of babies.'
p439
aS'If Lee and I can convince you of anyinstance in which genetic engineering of babies is legitimate, then you should voteagainst the resolution.'
p440
aS"Throughout the evening, I'll defend why genetic engineering isno different in kind from the many ways that we already engineer our children, from thepartners we choose to prenatal screening to the supplements we take that impact ourchildren and their fates."
p441
aS'Recently new research shows the powerful effect of takingfolate during pregnancy and how it reduces the incidence of autism in children.'
p442
aS'And yetno one thinks that we should ban folate.'
p443
aS"But I want to convince you that we already canand have taken the next step of genetic engineering of babies and that we would take adrastic step backwards to ban outright that technology.I'm going to tell you about inherited mitochondrial disorders, which are progressive andcause tragic health consequences."
p444
aS'A little biology 101 should help frame the debate.About 98 percent of your DNA is nuclear DNA.'
p445
aS'It codes for much of who you are.'
p446
aS'Butabout 2 percent of your DNA is mitochondrial which supplies the energy to your cells.To understand this, visualize a cell with its small nucleus and a little bundle inside of thecell and the mitochondrial DNA and the fluid that surrounds it.'
p447
aS'The nucleus of the cell iswhere 99.9 percent of the action is, but only in the mitochondria functions properly.About one in 5,000 babies born have problems with their mitochondrial DNA that causerare but incredibly serious disease, including heart failure, dementia, blindness, severesuffering and death.'
p448
aS'There is no way to treat the condition once it is acquired, and it isextremely difficult to predict how severely a child will be affected.'
p449
aS'With geneticengineering of babies, we can altogether avoid this suffering.Professors Winston and Krimsky will argue that we can just screen out and abort thedefective fetuses or destroy the embryos in the lab.'
p450
aS'But mitochondrial DNA, which issolely inherited from the mother, is often passed on to every child of an afflictedmother.'
p451
aS'Only genetic engineering can safeguard a woman against these difficult choicesand altogether eliminate the risk of a child being born with mitochondrial disease.'
p452
aS'Take,for example, Sharon, a woman who had a healthy pregnancy and who gave birth to abeautiful, healthy girl.'
p453
aS"Twenty-eight hours later, that baby died of an unknown disease.This tragic tale repeated itself five times as each of Sharon's babies lived for just a fewhours."
p454
aS'Only her son, Edward survived.'
p455
aS'And by age four, he started falling overrepeatedly.'
p456
aS"He'll spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair with little control over hismuscles.You see, Sharon has Lee's syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease, and she passed it onto all six of her children."
p457
aS'The only way that Sharon or any woman with a high level ofmitochondrial abnormality will have her own healthy genetic children is through geneticengineering of the babies.'
p458
aS"We'll talk about two techniques to do so: Pronucleartransfer and maternal spindle transfer that safely eliminate the risk of these diseases."
p459
aS'At least 30 children have already been born in the United States using an earlier versionof mitochondrial transfer.'
p460
aS'All of these children were born free of mitochondrial disease.And these newer techniques have even fewer risks than those earlier ones and promiseeven better outcomes for future generations.The United Kingdom, notoriously conservative about reproductive technologies, hasgiven the green light in the use of these technologies.'
p461
aS'A ban by the U.S. would make usan outlier, a country standing in the way of scientific progress, at odds with the scientificand ethical consensus that mitochondrial transfer, a form of genetic engineering ofbabies, is permissible.'
p462
aS'But mitochondrial genetic engineering proves my larger pointthat I want to convince you of this evening, that a middle ground approach is betterthan an outright ban.'
p463
aS"You'll hear my opponents talking about opening floodgates to adystopia of designing perfect babies."
p464
aS'But technology itself is not evil.'
p465
aS'Only misuse andmisapplication of it is.'
p466
aS'The public can and should decide what limits if any there shouldbe on the uses of genetic engineering.'
p467
aS'But a complete ban would just drive the practiceinto back alleys or overseas.'
p468
aS'Criminalizing genetic engineering will make the practicehidden from public view so that we will have no idea whether Sharon and women likeher are using unsafe and unsavory practitioners to carry out genetic engineering.Reproductive tourism is already rampant, where women and couples are traveling toforeign countries to gain access to reproductive technologies banned in their owncountries.'
p469
aS"You can be sure that women like Sharon, afflicted with terrible Lee'ssyndrome, will travel great distances to safeguard their children."
p470
aS'Now imagine just for amoment how we would enforce the outright ban that the resolution calls for.'
p471
aS'Would weforcibly genetically test all babies?'

p475
aS'Some of the worst examples of abuses of government power in the last centuryhave involved the government trying to control our reproduction.'

p657
aS'And, in fact, really, what weshould be trying to do -- rather than trying to risk making abnormal babies, what weshould be trying to do is to improve the environment so that the DNA functions in thebest possible way.There is a lot of evidence to show that a woman can change the cognitive ability, theintelligence of her fetus, by what she eats in pregnancy, what happens to her stresshormones in pregnancy, and this research is burgeoning.'

p762
aS'I just need to convince you of one example of acceptability and you should vote to oppose the proposition.'
p763
aS"And my colleague has already talked very eloquently about mitochondrial DNA deficiency, and I'm going to go beyond that, because I hope to convince my opponents here to vote for my side of this proposition."
p764
aS"They've both written and talked quite eloquently about the use of genetics to prevent disease."
p765
aS'So what are we talking about here tonight when we talk about genetic engineering?'
p766
aS"Conceptually, it's very simple: genetic engineering will allow perspective parents to give their child genetic information that they themselves do not carry."
p767
aS"That's how genetic engineering will first be used, not soon, but that's the way it's first going to be applied."
p768
aS'And to understand what parents might want to give their children, we should examine the facts of genetics that have become available to us over the last five to ten years, have given us a very different perspective on the human genome than we had previously.'
p769
aS'And it revealed some unpleasant facts.'
p770
aS'I want you to look at the person sitting to the right of you.'
p771
aS"And if there's no one on the right, look at the person sitting to the left."
p772
aS'That person and you differ at over a million locations in your DNA.'
p773
aS"Most of those differences don't do anything."
p774
aS"But even if you're a healthy adult, at least 100 of those genetic variance can cause deadly childhood disease."
p775
aS"Not in you, of course, because you're sitting in the audience."
p776
aS'But in your grandchildren or their grandchildren.'
p777
aS'You carry thousands of other genetic variants, every one of you in this room, that impact your health and risk to thousands of diseases in different ways, including cancer and heart disease and neurological disease.'
p778
aS'And some of the variants that you carry are better than those of your neighbor to the right.'
p779
aS'Some are worse than those of your neighbor.'
p780
aS'And all in all, some of us are born with better health genes, and some are not.'
p781
aS'Now, if you have made a decision, you or a daughter, granddaughter, have made a decision to have a child, what do you hope for the most in that child?'
p782
aS'And Dr. Winston has spoken eloquently to this question many, many times.'
p783
aS'You hope for a healthy child.'
p784
aS"You'll love any child, but you hope for a healthy child."
p785
aS'And Dr. Winston has also said, and I agree, in pluralistic societies like yours and mine, genetic selection against diseased embryos is a matter for the individuals concerned.'
p786
aS'If you agree with Dr. Winston on this point, it follows that you should be willing to accept genetic engineering when needed to accomplish the same goal.'
p787
aS"But, you might worry, doesn't this violate Mother Nature?"
p788
aS"Well, I'm here to tell you that Mother Nature doesn't care at all about you or your baby."
p789
aS'Throughout the history of the human species, Mother Nature has engaged in all-out warfare against us with infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria.'
p790
aS"And it's only in the last century that we gained the knowledge and power to fight back with vaccines and antibiotics and other medicines."
p791
aS'Now, do some people abuse pharmaceutical drugs?'
p792
aS'Of course there is abuse out there.'
p793
aS"But that doesn't mean that we should prohibit medicine."
p794
aS"With infectious diseases essentially vanquished in our society, although not everywhere in the world, the next target in our sights is Mother Nature's genetic wrath."
p795
aS"Unfortunately, if you're in the audience, it's too late to do anything about the genome and the hundreds of trillions of cells in your body."
p796
aS'But we can think about the future.'
p797
aS"You can think about your children's children and their children's children, because the expansive amount of knowledge we are gaining about the genome has flabbergasted even those of us who are most optimistic about this science."
p798
aS"So let's think about the next generation or the generation after that."
p799
aS"Now, Mother Nature is a metaphor, and it's a really bad metaphor because in reality, inheritance is a game of craps."
p800
aS'You throw the dice, you hold your breath, you hope your child is healthy.'
p801
aS"It won't have to be that way in the future when we learn how to take the genetic dice, place them on the table in the way that is going to promote health most likely for the child to be."
p802
aS'What about the risks?'
p803
aS"We've heard about the risks from both of the proponents of this proposition, the precautionary principle is often mentioned."
p804
aS"You shouldn't deploy a technology until all of the unknowable risks are known."
p805
aS"And we can't possibly understand how genes work because the whole system of life is very complex."
p806
aS'And if we put a new gene in, it might have unattended consequences.'
p807
aS'And I agree with the proponents of the proposition.'
p808
aS"We don't understand genetics."
p809
aS"It's very complex, and it's more complex the more we understand it."
p810
aS'But what society and people can do in the future is consider genetic information that already exists in some people but not others.'
p811
aS'I want to focus your mind on the fact, as I said a moment ago, we all carry thousands of genetic variants, some of which are promoting health and some of which are not.'
p812
aS'And even if a variant is in just 1 percent of the population out there, we can study the effects of that genetic variant in the people who carry that variant.'
p813
aS'And we can see the benefits or not of that variant.'
p814
aS'So the precautionary principle is not in effect here.'
p815
aS'I want to conclude that if you are thinking about voting for this proposition, you\'ll need to explain why you did so when your daughter or granddaughter comes to you with the following question: "Dad, grandpa, why can\'t I give my child health-promoting, disease- preventing genes that other children get naturally?'
