p368
aS'Stewart and Ihave worked on these issues for a while.'
p369
aS"We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms ofelectronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute,and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that Stewart andI are arguing for anything that is illegal."
p370
aS'And since the other side I think is very likely notto argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings ustogether.'
p371
aS'We are for lawful forms of surveillance.And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems canbe deployed.'
p372
aS'And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system hasevolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of anenormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community.'
p373
aS"It's hard tobelieve, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and nojurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conductelectronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes."
p374
aS'It wasunfettered.'
p375
aS"Now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court,the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with -- and an act of 1978, and then adjustedin important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years.And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind ofbroader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and thesesorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were notpreviously."
p376
aS'Previously -- if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powersof the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this.'
p377
aS'Andthose days are over.'
p378
aS'Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, andthe court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within thedomain of the president.'
p379
aS'There are now checks and balances on his power to do that,and that is extraordinary progress.'
p380
aS'And the third thing I want to say is how unusual thisarea is in Washington.'
p381
aS"As I said, there's partisan gridlock in here."
p382
aS"Name me anotherissue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in theMiddle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and thejudiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program.It's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in thecase of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisantransition."
p383
aS'So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of theBush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obamaadministration, two leaders who could not be more different.'
p384
aS"And they are unchanged.And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argumentbecause you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the twopresidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberaland quite educated in Constitutional law -- he taught it, University of Chicago -- and thejudiciary all backing up and saying it's fine."
p385
aS'So what the other side has to do, and it\'s atough burden I think, is say, "They\'ve all got it wrong, we\'ve got it right, we knowbetter.'

p631

p632
aS"We said we want the airlines to giveus the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who'sflying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects.We need to know who's coming here."
p633
aS'We use that data to compare the names and theinformation that was on there to the databases in which we had information aboutpeople we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about.'
p634
aS'And thenwhen those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spendingabout 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the UnitedStates, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat.'

aS"And most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on.But a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people."
p637
aS'Theyused this data to decide who was worth worrying about.'
p638
aS"Now, let's take the UnderwearBomber.The people who did airport security had no information about him."
p639
aS"And notsurprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them."
p640
aS'It turned out thatwhen he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who hadaccess to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, wereable to identify as somebody that they were worried about.'
p641
aS"So he would have beencaught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when helanded."
p642
aS"That's, indeed, probably why al-Qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before hehad to get past the customs officials.The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBIgot a phone number."
p643
aS'They asked our guys, do you have that phone number?'
p644
aS'Didanybody with that phone number come into the United States?'
p645
aS"Turned out that he'dgiven that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data.The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt."
p646
aS'And thenhe got on the plane and was about to leave the country.'
p647
aS"The only reason we caught himis because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were ableto run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're lookingfor."
p648
aS"He's on the plane."
p649
aS'That plane had already closed its doors when the customsofficials went on to pull him off.'

p653
aS"That's the real question we have here,is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data thatyou've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists?"

p758
aS"Of course, that's not what's at issue here."
p759
aS"What's at issue here is whether we have a problem with the secret NSA program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose author said this would never -- he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it."
p760
aS"I think that's a very different question."
p761
aS'The NSA is collecting information on every time every one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor, your psychiatrist, your AA mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend.'

p763

p767
aS'There are 30 bills that have been introduced in Congress to try to fix the problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances but because of Edward Snowden leaking it.'
p768

p769
aS'When the director of National Intelligence, James Clapper , was asked pointblank, "Are you collecting data on millions of Americans?'
p770
aS'" he said -- in Congress, under oath, he said, "No.'
p771
aS'Later he said that was the least untruthful answer he could give.'
p772
aS'Well, I think I can think of two more truthful answers.'
p773
aS'One would have been, "Yes," and the other would have been, "We can\'t confirm or deny.'

p775
aS"Mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it doesn't work, doesn't make us safe."
p776
aS"I'm going to suggest that you should vote against the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and privacy."
p777
aS'A healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs that it employs.'
p778
aS'We should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a democracy.'
p779
aS"Of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's also a role for democracy."
p780
aS'And when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy.'
p781
aS'National security is a compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds in order to keep us safe.'
p782
aS'But we have a right to have a say in how far the government goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera.'
p783
aS'And we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and lies.'
p784
aS'We should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy.'
p785
aS'Privacy is critical.'
p786
aS"It's essential to human development."
p787
aS"It's essential to intimate relations."
p788
aS"It's essential to political freedom."
p789
aS"People can't speak freely when they fear that the government may well be listening in."
p790
aS'Now, some people say, "Well, you know, if you\'ve got nothing to hide, you\'ve got nothing to fear.'
p791
aS'But I think most of us have nothing to hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our house, put password protections on our computers.'
p792
aS'Some of us limit who can be friends with us on Facebook.'
p793
aS'We seal the envelopes that we mail.'
p794
aS"We believe in maintaining privacy because it's central to human existence."
p795
aS"And it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in and invading that privacy."
p796
aS'Stewart suggests, "Well, some -- if Verizon has it, why should we be concerned if the government gets it?'
p797
aS'" Well, I think there are a number of reasons we should be concerned.'
p798
aS"First of all, Verizon doesn't collect this data on every person and hold it for five years as the NSA is doing."
p799
aS"That's precisely why the NSA is demanding it, because Verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets rid of it."
p800
aS"Second, Verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past."
p801
aS'The government does have that power.'
p802
aS"And, third, Verizon doesn't have the incentive to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it."
p803
aS"And we've seen it -- we saw it in the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on anti-war protesters, Civil War -- I mean civil rights activists, Martin Luther King, and womens rights activists."
p804
aS'So its not an abstract concern.'
p805
aS'Its a real concern.'
p806
