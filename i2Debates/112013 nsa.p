S"Thank you very much, John. Thank you all for coming. These issues we're debating"
p231
aS'tonight are difficult and very complex. They engage some of the most fundamental'
p232
aS'issues in American public life: Liberty, security, technology, democracy. And there'
p233
aS"really are no simple answers to this. We'll do our best to distill it, but let me just say,"
p234
aS"anyone who's worked in these issues in a practical way knows how hard they are and"
p235
aS'that they do need to be very carefully weighed and not handled impulsively or'
p236
aS'ideologically.'
p237
aS"I'm going to make three points in this opening statement. The programs that we're"
p238
aS'going to talk about tonight really do matter for security. And for me, having been'
p239
aS'deputy commissioner of counterterrorism at the NYPD and then three different jobs in'
p240
aS'the White House before, during and after 9/11, I can really tell you this on a first hand'
p241
aS'basis.'
p242
aS'And we may get into some of the details of how this works, how these sorts of systems'
p243
aS'lead to the original lead that then leads to the unraveling of a plot and the saving of'
p244
aS"lives. It is not abstract. It is real no kidding lives at stake sort of business. I don't want"
p245
aS"to hyperventilate about it, but I've lived through enough of them to be able to recount"
p246
aS"some of the direct experiences. And if that comes up in a Q&A, we'll have to go through"
p247
aS'them in greater detail. But they really do matter. Turns out a terrorist plot is not that'
p248
aS'difficult to stop if you know about it, and finding out about it in the first place is by far'
p249
aS'the hardest step in the process.'
p250
aS"In the overwhelming number of incidents that we've had since 9/11, that original lead,"
p251
aS'what\'s called the "predication for further investigative steps," has come from electronic'
p252
aS'surveillance of one form or another, so these programs really do matter. Second, and'
p253
aS"what I'm about to say I think is going to unite both sides of this debate. Stewart and I"
p254
aS'have worked on these issues for a while. We are for lawful surveillance, lawful forms of'
p255
aS'electronic surveillance, things which clearly backed up by the Constitution, by statute,'
p256
aS"and by court interpretation are permissible, so don't for a second think that Stewart and"
p257
aS'I are arguing for anything that is illegal. And since the other side I think is very likely not'
p258
aS'to argue in favor of illegal surveillance either, I think this is something that brings us'
p259
aS'together. We are for lawful forms of surveillance.'
p260
aS'And there is an extensive body of law that governs when, how, where these systems can'
p261
aS'be deployed. And this is not a legal seminar, but I can tell you that, that system has'
p262
aS'evolved in such a way, over the last 35 years, that it is really nothing short of an'
p263
aS"enormous success for the American privacy and civil liberties community. It's hard to"
p264
aS"believe, but it's a fact that 35 years ago there was no statutory constraint and no"
p265
aS'jurisprudential constraint on the ability of the president of the United States to conduct'
p266
aS'electronic surveillance inside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. It was'
p267
aS"unfettered. Now it's fettered quite significantly, first with the creation of a FISA court,"
p268
aS'the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with -- and an act of 1978, and then adjusted'
p269
aS'in important ways with the FISA Modernization Acts of the last five years.'
p270
aS'And so this is something you really have to understand, if you take this in kind of'
p271
aS'broader historical context, an incredible amount of progress has been made, and these'
p272
aS'sorts of programs have been brought under the constraint of law where they were not'
p273
aS'previously. Previously -- if these laws had never been passed, it was solely the powers'
p274
aS'of the president under the Constitution, Article 2 that permitted him to do this. And'
p275
aS'those days are over. Now there is a law which governs it, and many laws, in fact, and'
p276
aS'the court is involved in overseeing things which previously were exclusively within the'
p277
aS'domain of the president. There are now checks and balances on his power to do that,'
p278
aS'and that is extraordinary progress. And the third thing I want to say is how unusual this'
p279
aS"area is in Washington. As I said, there's partisan gridlock in here. Name me another"
p280
aS'issue in public life, health care or taxation or entitlement reform or what to do in the'
p281
aS'Middle East, where you have the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the'
p282
aS'judiciary all unanimous about the contours and direction of a specific program.'
p283
aS"It's remarkable that this happened, not just the three branches of government but in the"
p284
aS'case of the executive branch a set of policies and programs which have survived partisan'
p285
aS'transition. So these programs which we have today emerged in the latter half of the'
p286
aS'Bush administration and have survived essentially unchanged into the Obama'
p287
aS'administration, two leaders who could not be more different. And they are unchanged.'
p288
aS'And so this is where the other side of this debate really have a pretty tough argument'
p289
aS'because you have broad bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress, the two'
p290
aS'presidents of different parties, different characters, one, the current one, quite liberal'
p291
aS'and quite educated in Constitutional law -- he taught it, University of Chicago -- and the'
p292
aS"judiciary all backing up and saying it's fine. So what the other side has to do, and it's a"
p293
aS'tough burden I think, is say, "They\'ve all got it wrong, we\'ve got it right, we know'
p294
aS"better. And I think frankly that's a pretty high burden for them. Thank you very much."

p331
aS'unless youre a terrorist or a criminal you should also vote no, whether you care about'

p334

p336
aS'Najibullah Zazis crew who got an explosive into New York City, but ultimately flushed it'
p337
aS'down the toilet rather than detonating it.'
p338
aS'These terrorists all traveled to foreign terrorist training camps. Then they came to the'
p339
aS'United States and attempted to bomb us. Luck is what protected us in these cases, not'
p340
aS'mass surveillance.'
p341
aS'Spying also didnt protect us from the Boston Marathon bombers or shootings at Fort'
p342
aS'Hood or at an army recruiting center in Arkansas. These terrorists were investigated by'
p343
aS'the FBI before they went on their rampages and yet they werent stopped. While the'
p344
aS'government was spying on us, violence from far right extremists killed 300 people in the'
p345
aS'United States since 2001. And this is just a tiny fraction of the 14,000 murders that'
p346
aS'happen in the United States every year. A third of those -- more than a third of those --'
p347
aS'go unsolved. Solving 4,000 murders a year? That would keep us safer. In a 16-year FBI'

aS'piece of domestic mail, it intercepts Americans international communications and'

aS'financial transactions, it collects millions of images from license plates readers and'
p364
aS'surveillance cameras. The FBI even collects census information so it can map American'
p365
aS'communities by race and ethnicity. The problem with these programs -- the problem is'
p366
aS'that these programs collect so much information that the signal gets lost in the noise.'
p367
aS'So its not a surprise that the NSA can point to only one terrorism-related prosecution'
p368
aS'that might not have happened absent gobbling up all of our telephone numbers, and'
p369
aS'that was a material support for terrorism case that involved an $8,000 transmittal to'

p372
aS'If a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts had been solved the Boston'
p373
aS'Marathon bombing might never have happened. Instead of making us safe, these mass'
p374
aS'surveillance programs cast undeserved suspicion on innocent people, simply because'
p375
aS'theyre linked somehow to a suspect -- not a terrorist, but suspect, often by two or'
p376
aS'three degrees of separation, like that old Kevin Bacon game. This process creates a'
p377
aS'flood of false positives that then have to be run to ground. These are what the FBI used'
p378
aS'to call the "Pizza Hut leads" because they often ended up at the pizza delivery guy. The'

p442
aS'When, if ever, is it appropriate for the government to gather data on large populations,'
p443
aS'everybody in order to make us more safe?'
p444
aS"So that's the question. You can call it spying on everybody, if you like, and he does. But"
p445
aS"it's not as unusual or as ineffective, and certainly not illegal as he suggests. And I'll take"
p446
aS'his challenge of saying, "When has spying on everybody -- when has gathering all of the'
p447
aS'data on everybody, innocent or not, helped us stop terrorist attacks?" and let\'s take the'
p448
aS'Zazi case, the Times Square bombing case, the Underwear Bomber.'
p449
aS'When I was at DHS, one of the things we fought very hard to do was something that I'
p450
aS'think Mike German would call spying on everyone. We said we want the airlines to give'
p451
aS"us the travel reservation information and the passport information on everybody who's"
p452
aS'flying into the United States; everybody, not just the suspects.'
p453
aS"We need to know who's coming here. We use that data to compare the names and the"
p454
aS'information that was on there to the databases in which we had information about'
p455
aS'people we were worried about, or patterns that we were worried about. And then'
p456
aS'when those people arrived, a few of them, half of a percent, would end up spending'
p457
aS'about 45 minutes talking to a customs agent about why they were coming to the United'
p458
aS'States, who would try to determine whether this person was a threat. That was a'
p459
aS"routine practice. And most of us just, you know, it's welcome home, and you move on."
p460
aS"But a few people, they couldn't stop everybody, but they could stop a few people. They"
p461
aS"used this data to decide who was worth worrying about. Now, let's take the Underwear"
p462
aS'Bomber.'
p463
aS'The people who did airport security had no information about him. And not'
p464
aS"surprisingly, didn't check in very carefully, and he got right past them. It turned out that"
p465
aS'when he was due to land, he had already been flagged by the customs folks who had'
p466
aS'access to that data as somebody that they, through checking back in databases, were'
p467
aS'able to identify as somebody that they were worried about. So he would have been'
p468
aS"caught if we'd had the information earlier, and he would have been caught when he"
p469
aS"landed. That's, indeed, probably why al-Qaeda wanted to blow up the plane before he"
p470
aS'had to get past the customs officials.'
p471
aS'The same thing is true for the Times Square Bomber, where after the bombing, the FBI'
p472
aS'got a phone number. They asked our guys, do you have that phone number? Did'
p473
aS"anybody with that phone number come into the United States? Turned out that he'd"
p474
aS'given that same phone number to the airline for his reservation data.'
p475
aS'The department was able to identify him, provide the data, start a man hunt. And then'
p476
aS'he got on the plane and was about to leave the country. The only reason we caught him'
p477
aS'is because we had data on everybody who was getting on that plane, and we were able'
p478
aS"to run the information in the background and determine, this is the guy we're looking"
p479
aS"for. He's on the plane. That plane had already closed its doors when the customs"
p480
aS'officials went on to pull him off. He would have gotten away, but for the data which'
p481
aS'Mike German calls, "Spying on everybody. I would call it "gathering data that is already'
p482
aS'in the hands of third parties," given it to the airlines, they\'re going to use it to decide'
p483
aS'whether you get chicken or tornadoes, and whether you get that 3 inches of extra leg'
p484
aS"room. You know, I'm happy to have that information also used to make sure I actually"
p485
aS'arrive at my destination.'
p486
aS'And it seems to me that the intrusion -- you can call a lot of scary things, but the fact is,'
p487
aS"at the end of the day, it's information that I willingly shared with the airlines, and I'm"
p488
aS"happy that they're using it to protect me as well. That's the real question we have here,"
p489
aS"is, can we use data that we've given to a third party, can the government use data that"
p490
aS"you've given to a third party, to try to find terrorists? We do that all the time. The NSA"
p491
aS'program is probably the most aggressive use of that. But at the end of the day, this is'
p492
aS"billing information you've given -- we've all given to the phone companies. It is searched"
p493
aS'by law enforcement outside of the NSA program 1.3 million times a year. What the NSA'
p494
aS'did, at the end of the day, through the program and through the safeguards that they'
p495
aS'established for that program, they required --'
p496
aS'Yes, we gather the information, but no one can search it without articulable, reasonable'
p497
aS"suspicion passed on by a lawyer. It'll be audited. A limited number of people will have"
p498
aS'access to it. At the end of the day, 300 numbers went into that on a given year. 500 --'
p499
aS'there were searches to find who they were talking to. 500 numbers came out as'
p500
aS'potentially suspicious. And only then did the government go out to try to find out'
p501
aS'whose name was associated with those phone numbers. 500 people versus -- and all'
p502
aS'used for terrorist purposes, all carefully scrubbed versus 1.3 million searches done by'
p503
aS'law enforcement every day without bringing 1984 home to America. Thank you.'

p536
aS"that we've all known about for years, and no one has had any problem with. Of course,"
p537
aS"that's not what's at issue here. What's at issue here is whether we have a problem with"
p538
aS'the secret NSA program adopted in secret through secret interpretations of a law whose'
p539
aS'author said this would never -- he never would have dreamed of authorizing this sort of'
p540
aS"program, had he known that's what the government was going to do with it. I think"
p541
aS"that's a very different question. The NSA is collecting information on every time every"
p542
aS'one of us calls or texts anybody; your son, your daughter, your mother, your doctor,'
p543
aS'your psychiatrist, your AA mentor, your old girlfriend, your new girlfriend.'
p544
aS"That's what they're collecting. It's not passenger data about people getting on"
p545
aS"airplanes. It's literally every phone call. It's doing it in secret, as I said, pursuant to a"
p546
aS'secret interpretation of a law whose author said this is not consistent with what I'
p547
aS"understood. And Rich Falkenrath says there's unanimity about this program, I don't"
p548
aS'think so. There are 30 bills that have been introduced in Congress to try to fix the'
p549
aS'problem that has now been disclosed not because of openness and checks and balances'
p550
aS'but because of Edward Snowden leaking it. And this is a program that the NSA lied to'
p551
aS'Congress to keep secret from us. When the director of National Intelligence, James'
p552
aS'Clapper , was asked pointblank, "Are you collecting data on millions of Americans?" he'
p553
aS'said -- in Congress, under oath, he said, "No. Later he said that was the least untruthful'
p554
aS'answer he could give.'
p555
aS'Well, I think I can think of two more truthful answers. One would have been, "Yes," and'
p556
aS'the other would have been, "We can\'t confirm or deny. But instead he lied to us, lied'
p557
aS"to us, why, because if we knew that this program was underway, we wouldn't accept it."
p558
aS'Mike has suggested reasons why you should vote against this kind of spying, because it'
p559
aS"doesn't work, doesn't make us safe. I'm going to suggest that you should vote against"
p560
aS'the program because it violates core principles of a democracy, transparency, and'
p561
aS'privacy.'
p562
aS'A healthy democracy demands transparency from the government and privacy for the'
p563
aS'citizens, but it seems that today we have reversed that, with the government'
p564
aS'demanding transparency from us but insisting on secrecy with respect to the programs'
p565
aS'that it employs.'
p566
aS'We should be concerned about this because of the problems that secrecy poses to a'
p567
aS"democracy. Of course there's a role for secrecy in terms of national security, but there's"
p568
aS'also a role for democracy. And when you have an agency engaging in conduct that the'
p569
aS'person who passed the law says is totally inconsistent with the law he passed and doing'
p570
aS'it in secret and lying about it, you have a problem with democracy. National security is a'
p571
aS'compelling state interest, and it is justifiable to engage in surveillance of a range of kinds'
p572
aS'in order to keep us safe. But we have a right to have a say in how far the government'
p573
aS'goes in spying on us and our daughters and our sons and our mothers, et cetera. And'
p574
aS'we were denied that, say, and denied it in the worst possible way, through secrecy and'
p575
aS'lies.'
p576
aS'We should also be concerned about the program because it invades our privacy. Privacy'
p577
aS"is critical. It's essential to human development. It's essential to intimate relations. It's"
p578
aS"essential to political freedom. People can't speak freely when they fear that the"
p579
aS'government may well be listening in. Now, some people say, "Well, you know, if you\'ve'
p580
aS"got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear. But I think most of us have nothing to"
p581
aS'hide but most of us nonetheless close the door to our bedrooms, close the door to our'
p582
aS'house, put password protections on our computers. Some of us limit who can be'
p583
aS'friends with us on Facebook.'
p584
aS"We seal the envelopes that we mail. We believe in maintaining privacy because it's"
p585
aS'central to human existence.'
p586
aS"And it's particularly essential to a robust democracy that people have the privacy to"
p587
aS"engage in political discussion without fear that the government's going to be coming in"
p588
aS'and invading that privacy. Stewart suggests, "Well, some -- if Verizon has it, why should'
p589
aS'we be concerned if the government gets it?" Well, I think there are a number of'
p590
aS"reasons we should be concerned. First of all, Verizon doesn't collect this data on every"
p591
aS"person and hold it for five years as the NSA is doing. That's precisely why the NSA is"
p592
aS'demanding it, because Verizon just gets it, looks at it for billing records, and then gets'
p593
aS"rid of it. Second, Verizon doesn't have the power to lock you up, it doesn't have the"
p594
aS"power to indict you, it doesn't have the power to investigate you for tax evasion"
p595
aS"because it doesn't like your politics, which we've seen this government do in the past."
p596
aS"The government does have that power. And, third, Verizon doesn't have the incentive"
p597
aS'to go after its customers in the same way that government unfortunately all too often'
p598
aS"has an incentive to go after those that are critical of it. And we've seen it -- we saw it in"
p599
aS"the '60s and '70s with a national security program that ended up focusing on anti-war"
p600
aS'protesters, Civil War -- I mean civil rights activists, Martin Luther King, and womens'
p601
aS'rights activists. So its not an abstract concern. Its a real concern. So I think because'
p602
aS'the NSA program turns democracy on its head, demanding that our lives be transparent'
p603
aS'and insisting on secrecy for the government, you should vote against the motion.'

p630

p632
aS'exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon -- that by and large'

aS'that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards. Those safeguards are'

p638
aS'against this motion, Spy on Me, Id Rather be Safe. Theyre saying yes, there are threats'

p643
aS'that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who'

p1784
aS'standpoint. Im hopefully they only person in this room whos actually been part of a'
p1785
aS'terrorist conspiracy so I have a little bit of insight on what terrorists want. They want'
p1786
aS'you to be afraid. They know they arent powerful enough to overthrow a government'
p1787
aS'or popular enough to win an election. So their only tool is to use horrible violence to try'
p1788
aS'to provoke a government into taking measures that damages itself.'
p1789
aS'They know that when people are afraid they make bad decisions, they act irrationally,'
p1790
aS'and their hope is that the government is going to overreact to the threat, right? Theyre'
p1791
aS'going to go after communities of suspicion rather than focusing on individuals who are'
p1792
aS'meaning harm. One of the interesting things I found working in terrorist groups: they'
p1793
aS'always have a manifesto, right? They create a clandestine organization and the first'
p1794
aS'thing they do is tell everybody in the world who they are. From an undercover'
p1795
aS'perspective, thats bad policy, but the reason they do it is because theyre trying to'
p1796
aS'provoke grievance so that -- they want to let the government know who to go after so'
p1797
aS'that they start to build real grievance, and thats what starts to undermine the'
p1798
aS'government, when it starts losing its legitimacy by doing things that violate its own'
p1799
aS'values. Thats why I think the founding fathers were so genius when they created a'
p1800
aS'system that inoculated against this kind of reaction, right?'
p1801
aS'It made sure that the government was accountable to the people and limited in the'
p1802
aS'power that it could use, particularly in violating the civil rights of Americans, and what'
p1803
aS'they knew wasnt that that was going to be a weak form of government, but that that'
p1804
aS'would be the strongest government on earth. We dont need to be afraid. We need to'

p1837

p1845
aS'identified. Quickly, his two key co-conspirators, and then subject to much higher levels'

aS'York, where I was at the NYPD, and it was stopped not entirely, but in large measure'
p1848

aS'with, what books you read, who you were talking to, what you thought, it was very'

p1872
aS'invade our privacy. That check has gone out the window because of the -- because of Al'
p1873
aS"Gore and the internet. We now -- it's now possible to learn everything about us through"
p1874
aS"this third party information which Richard Falkenrath says we shouldn't be concerned"
p1875
aS'about at all. I think we need to be concerned about it. I think we can strike a proper'
p1876
aS'balance between the technology that makes it possible for this kind of very, very broad'
p1877
aS"surveillance and the need to find bad guys. But we can't do so if the programs are run in"
p1878
aS"secret, if the NSA is lying to us about it, and if we haven't had an opportunity to have a"
p1879
aS'democratic deliberation.'
p1880
aS"And when we don't have that democratic deliberation, it seems to me it's very likely"
p1881
aS'that the security people are going to go overboard on the side of security. And when'

p1885
aS'Why does the NSA need to know that information? The only reason that they have'

S'Thanks, John. You know, when I started as general counsel of the National Security'
p1910
aS'Agency, Janet Reno, the attorney general, came out for a visit. And this was a high-'
p1911
aS'stakes meeting. She was deeply skeptical about whether this spy agency could be'
p1912
aS'trusted at all, whether it understood what the Fourth Amendment was. And we were'
p1913
aS'walking through an operations center with her when the director stopped, looked at a'
p1914
aS'corporal who was going over some intercepts, and he said to the corporal, "Stand up,'
p1915
aS'sir. And "what do you do if you find a communication by an American?" that corporal'
p1916
aS'plucked out of a mass of people doing the intercepts, said, "Sir, we segregate that. We'
p1917
aS"cannot disseminate it unless there's foreign intelligence in it."
p1918
aS"We must take the -- we must anonymize the data and destroy it if there's no intelligence"
p1919
aS'in it," which was the rule. And I thought to myself, you know, the first rule of lawyering'
p1920
aS"is don't ask a question if you don't know what the answer's going to be. But the director"
p1921
aS'was absolutely sure that you could pick anybody out of that agency and ask him what'
p1922
aS'the rules were. He would tell you and would be proud of the fact that he knew them'
p1923
aS'and would obey them. That is the culture of the National Security Agency. If you give'
p1924
aS'them the rules, they will follow those rules. They have -- we have given them rules in'
p1925
aS'this context. They are subject to lots of constraints. We cannot say, "All of this public,'
p1926
aS'or we might as well not try to gather intelligence. We have to set rules, we have to'
p1927
aS'count on people to enforce them, and then we have to count on the goodwill of our'
p1928
aS"agencies to carry them out because that's our only hope of being able to do intelligence"
p1929
aS'under law. I think we can do it.'

p1945

p1948
aS'push number two. And if you became or remain undecided, push number three. And'

aS"you can ignore the other keys. They're not live. And if you make a mistake, just correct"
p1950

aS"So while that's being done, one thing I want to say is I've been exchanging glances with"
p1953
aS'our executive producer who sits in the front row. And the thumbs-up came up about'
p1954
aS'halfway through.'
p1955
aS"I think this is one of the best debates that we've ever had in terms of not only the"
p1956
aS'material that the teammates -- that the opponents and teammates brought to the table,'
p1957
aS'but also the spirit in which this was conducted and the respect, and the -- our favorite'
p1958
aS'word -- the intelligence of it. So I just want to invite a round of applause for all of them.'
p1959
aS'I also -- I also want to congratulate everyone who asked a question, and that includes'
p1960
aS'the questions that I passed on. There was nothing wrong with any of them. This is the'
p1961
aS'kind of thing that really makes you think, and your brain starts going, and I think in fact a'
p1962
aS'couple of the questions that I turned down in themselves would make excellent topics'
p1963
aS'for debate. So everybody who put their hands up and those who got up to ask'
p1964
aS'questions, I want to thank you as well for doing that.'
p1965
aS'As we said at the beginning, we would love to have you tweet about this debate. You'
p1966
aS"can use the Twitter handle at IQ2US. That's us. The hash tag is SpyDebate. Our next"
p1967
aS'debate will be in New York City on Wednesday, December 4, if you can get up there for'
p1968
aS'that. And I happen to know that there are some of our New York audience members'
p1969
aS'who came down for this debate.'
p1970
aS"So you've got to copy that and go up to New York. The topic on December 4 will be"
p1971
aS'"Don\'t eat anything with a face."'
p1972
aS'For the motion, Dr. Neal Barnard, he is a clinical researcher who studies the effects of'
