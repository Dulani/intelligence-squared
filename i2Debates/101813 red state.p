aS'Its wonderful to get out of Washington D.C., which I call Americans only work free drug zone and lately actually it has been a work free drug zone -- So let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a better life you should move to a red state and I would start with one observation, which is that over the last 20 years weve seen in America the biggest shift in wealth in the history of this country.'
p325
aS'Weve also seen a massive change in population of where people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in this country and where its not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years theres been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth and income have moved from one state to another on that.'
p326
aS'This according to Travis Brown who has written a great book about how money walks, and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states and they are moving to red states.'
p327
aS'Now some of this of course is due to things like weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging society and are moving to states like Florida, and Georgia, and North Carolina and South Carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here.'
p328
aS'But its happening all over this country.'
p329
aS'Not just moving to better weather states.'
p330
aS'In fact if you look at the statistics, an amazing statistic about California -- and I agree with Gray Davis, what a wonderful state this is -- how do you screw it up so much?'
p331
aS'You know how does the state get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful paradise?'
p332
aS'Over the last five years one million jobs, roughly -- these arent exact numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in California, and over that same time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of Texas.'
p333
aS'Thats an amazing statistic.'
p334
aS'You want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic power its leaving California, its going to Texas.'
p335
aS'Now I would submit to you that people are not leaving places like Los Angeles and San Diego to go to Houston for the weather.'
p336
aS'Theyre not doing that, right?'
p337
aS'Theyre moving there because thats where the opportunity is, thats where the jobs are.'
p338
aS'Thats where the kind of free enterprise systems flourish.'
p339
aS'And by the way just to continue with this Texas-California comparison, because I think well make this a lot throughout the debate because Texas is a prototypical red state, and California is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is California is not 40 percent higher than it is in Texas, which is amazing.'
p340
aS'People are always bad mouthing Texas, Oh they dont even have plumbing in Texas and so on, the truth is Texas is actually getting very rich, California not so much so.'
p341
aS'Second point to make that you should all ponder.'
p342
aS'We are all living through, right now, what I call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country perhaps anytime since the civil war.'
p343
aS'And what youre seeing -- to put it very simply if you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue states are getting bluer.'
p344
aS'And there is absolutely no question about it.'
p345
aS'If you look at whats happened, for example, in the Southern states every election for the last four or five election cycles they get more and more Republican, for better or worse, and thats also true of the blue states.'
p346
aS'I hail from the state of Illinois; I love the Chicago area; I love the State of Illinois.'
p347
aS'What has happened in Illinois over the last 25 years is one of the great tragedies of our country.'
p348
aS'Illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single area.'
p349
aS'It has huge unfunded liabilities.'
p350
aS'High unemployment rate, the dingbats in Springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent.'
p351
aS'One of my favorite kinds of modern politicians Mitch Daniels, a couple years ago when he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of Illinois, and just put it so well he said To be a neighboring state of Illinois in Indiana is like living down the street from the Simpsons.'
p352
aS'I thought that is a great way to put it.'
p353
aS'And so we are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and its a tragedy by the way.'
p354
aS'And then you ask the question Why are people moving from blue states to red states?'
p355
aS'And I would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are moving.'
p356
aS'The two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research, are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to join a union or not, those states are flourishing.'
p357
aS'And one of the fun things about working at the Wall Street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies, they always tell us when theyre talking about setting up a new plant or a new warehouse the first question they ask about a state where theyre going to locate is is it a right to work state?'
p358
aS'Because it its not a right to work state its simply, they just take it off the list.'
p359
aS'No matter how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if youre not a right to work state youre just not in the game to get these new enterprises.'
p360
aS'By the way people are always talking about America losing its auto industry, and auto jobs.'
p361
aS'You know Americas not losing its auto jobs, its just the auto jobs arent in states like Ohio and Michigan anymore.'
p362
aS'The auto jobs are now in the South, right?'
p363
aS'And thats partly because of the fact that those are right to work states.'
p364
aS'The second factor that matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes.'
p365
aS'And we find this to be highly predictable for where people move.'
p366
aS'And so for example in this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax.'
p367
aS'States like Texas, states like Florida, states like Tennessee, states like Wyoming, states like Nevada, states like Washington.'
p368
aS'Those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have --'

aS'My advantage, however, is I have a book coming out on the very last day of this year called The Happiest Life and I have spent the last year immersed in the details of the emerging science of happiness, begun 15 years ago by my colleague Dennis Prager with the book Happiness Is A Serious Problem and now most recently by Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, in his book the Road to Freedom, happiness is quantifiable.'
p595
aS'You can figure out what makes people happy and what makes people happy is more to be found in the red states then the blue states.'

p600
aS'Theyre in their 20s.'
p601
aS'And theyre going to drop me into a blue state or a red state, I get to pick blue or red.'

p603

p604
aS'You dont know where theyre going to end up just red or blue.'
p605
aS'Four reasons to say to him son or daughter, red.'
p606
aS'Number one, when you get there, youre going to want to buy a house, California is 200 percent above the median cost in the average house in America.'
p607
aS'California is below that median.'
p608
aS'New York is 150 percent.'
p609
aS'Highest mortgage debt is in California, highest mortgage debt is in the District of Columbia.'
p610
aS'You want your child to be able to buy a house and begin that American dream, send them to a red state.'
p611
aS'Number two, youre going to want them to have kids, right?'
p612
aS'You want to be grandparents.'
p613
aS'Everybody wants to be a grandparent, I just became a grandparent; its a great thing.'
p614
aS'Guess where the fertility is?'
p615
aS'Guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most fertile states are red.'
p616
aS'The 10 least fertile states are blue.'
p617
aS'I want to read that blue list to you, because it really is blue, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, theyre going to way of Russia and Spain, they will not be there in 10 years because theyre not any children.'
p618
aS'But more importantly -- actually thats just an indication of other things.'
p619
aS'Volunteerism is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving.'
p620
aS'As you will know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red.'
p621
aS'Now of course we got Utah and Idaho and weve got the Mormon tide to drive them that way but the other seven are not.'
p622
aS'They are, however--whats that an indication of?'
p623
aS'Religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious belief.'
p624
aS'Red state advantage huge on charitable giving.'
p625
aS'Number three though when you get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, theyre going to have to drive around a lot, theyre going to have actual practical things to think about in the course of their lives.'
p626
aS'Number one, think about the number of times youve pulled into a gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state decision, theyre going to pull into a gas station.'
p627
aS'Its a good proxy for the practical cost of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that, proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states.'
p628
aS'Red states are energy productive.'
p629
aS'When I was talking to Steven beforehand and he said you take the economics and Ill take the social stuff.'
p630
aS'We didnt really say where energy would fit, I thought maybe he would talk about energy production, but then I began to think its really proxy for the willingness to go and grow with what youve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of yours are going to need to be educated.'
p631
aS'Whos doing the best?'
p632
aS'Now Michael Lind is a very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not make sense, thats what they do from that side.'
p633
aS'But you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat this one from the national education assessment study.'
p634
aS'The most underprivileged kids when it comes to education are African Americans and Latinos.'
p635
aS'The most important manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle.'
p636
aS'The most important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight.'
p637
aS'That is the turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and possibility of those children.'
p638
aS'In the NEAS, the state that is now number two that has made the most progress over the last decade is Texas for blacks and for Latinos, they have rocketed up.'
p639
aS'Do you know what state is number 49?'
p640
aS'This one.'
p641
aS'Why is that?'
p642
aS'Its because education, innovation is occurring in the red states.'
p643
aS'Why is that?'
p644
aS'Because they are not in the death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective.'
p645
aS'Thats why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and you could not guarantee that theyre going to a private but they are going to go into a public school.'
p646
aS'You would pick a red state.'
p647
aS'If you were a grandma or grandpa who wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education arena.'
p648
aS'Now as I warn you again, Michael will come up and bring up SAT scores or ACT scores, and I will give him that, theyre higher in the blue states.'
p649
aS'Youve got some legacy investments in the blue state.'
p650
aS'Youve got some wonderful cultural advantages.'
p651
aS'You might be thinking I want my grandchild to live in San Francisco.'
p652
aS'No you dont get to pick that.'
p653
aS'This is Rawlsian.'
p654
aS'Theyre just going to go red or blue.'

aS'The amount of migration from Texas -- from California to Texasis also very easy to exaggerate.'
p761
aS'Texans move to California just as Californians move toTexas.'
p762
aS'Between July of 2011 and July of 2012 a grand total of 22,000 more Californiansmoved to Texas than Texas moved the other way.'
p763
aS'The number was 17,000 surplus forTexas and New York.'
p764
aS'Were talking about less than 0.01 percent of the US population inevery case.What is more, the lower your income, the less likely -- the more likely you are to movefrom California to Texas.'
p765
aS'Now why is this important?'
p766
aS'It undercuts the thesis that highprogressive income taxes are driving out Californians.'
p767
aS'Because if that were true youwould expect to see an exodus of rich Californians.'
p768
aS'What youre seeing instead is anexodus of working class and lower middle class Californians and we know why.'
p769
aS'Thereare two factors.'
p770
aS'Theres the push factor, which was the housing bubble in California.'
p771
aS'Ittook place almost exclusively in blue states, mainly because rich people, after the techbubble bottomed out, were looking for new and safe assets.'
p772
aS'And they had moreconfidence in the economic future of property assets going up in places like California, inNew York, in Florida than they did in Texas and the south.'
p773
aS'So by dramatically raising thecost of living in the blue states that did force out a lot of working class people.Often -- not to the south and Texas and the Great Plains, but to states neighboring.'
p774
aS'Forexample a lot of the working class people who have moved for housing affordability,have gone to other blue states like Oregon and Washington on the west coast.'
p775
aS'Theyrejust cheaper than California.'
p776
aS'And you see a similar spill over affect elsewhere.'
p777
aS'The pollfactor that is creating so many of these jobs in Texas is the energy industry.'
p778
aS'And if youlook at the red states in general, where this is taking place.'
p779
aS"It's in this energy corridorwhere thanks to fracking from the Bakken shale up in the Dakotas all the way down toTexas to the Eagle Ford shale, you see a tremendous explosion of energy."
p780
aS'It lowersenergy prices.'
p781
aS'It helps manufacturing, all of that.'
p782
aS'That is an accident of geography plusregulatory and technological factors.'
p783
aS'If the blue states who have energy resources likeCalifornia and New York, were actually to, with some environmental safeguards toemulate these red states, you would see enormous amounts of wealth pouring into theblue states on top of their advantages.So, we agree on many things.'

p863
aS'We have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State.'
p864
aS'Hugh Hewitt and Stephen Moore are arguing for the red states.'
p865
aS'They argue that we already see the evidence that the American population is making this decision with its feet, because of the big shift in population since World War II, but more recently and increasingly, a large shift in wealth going to the red states.'
p866
aS"They say the reasons people are moving, they're moving for the right to work."
p867
aS'They are moving attracted by lower income taxes, by the ability to buy homes, that there are indicators like fertility, which is on a rampage in the red states, and that all in all the message is the dynamic is moving very much in the favor of the red states.'
p868
aS'The team arguing against them, Gray Davis and Michael Lind, argue by bringing forth a set of statistics that show us a snapshot of all sorts of advantages already accruing to residents of blue states.'
p869
aS'Blue states have higher average income.'
p870
aS'People in blue states are living longer.'
p871
aS'They are more likely to have a college degree, and to be healthier, and they dispute the notion that people are moving to the red states for benefits, such as lower income taxes.'
p872
aS"Texas and the southern states, you just heard, offer air conditioning, and that may be what's drawing people more than the lower taxes, because the portion of the population that's moving to these states wouldn't actually be benefiting from lower taxes, because they're just not paid enough."
p873
aS"So I want to take a question to the side that's arguing against the motion for the blue states."
p874
aS"This is a tricky debate, because both sides are coming at us with dueling statistics and it's a fairly easy thing to pick and choose, but as I did just point out, you presented, Gray Davis and Michael Lind arguing for the blue states, a snapshot of several ways in which already if you're in a blue state you're better off for various reasons, but your opponents, I think, are arguing about a dynamic as opposed to a snapshot."
p875
