aS'Well todays motion -- I really want to call a lot of attention to the language. It was'
p73
aS"pretty deliberate. For a better future, live in a red state. So it's not merely about which"
p74
aS'model of state governance is most in accordance with your policy preferences or'
p75
aS"predilections. It's really about where you choose to live. And I mean I know countless"
p76
aS'people whose policy predilections would be blue state, but who choose to live in red'
p77
aS'states. And that dichotomy between how you vote with your mouth and how you vote'
p78
aS'with your feet is part of what should encourage people in the audience here to think'
p79
aS'twice.'
p80
aS"All right, everyone. So you're going to have the chance to think twice as we welcome"

p87

p88
aS"they come and go from breaks. So just that you know that I haven't lost it."
p89
aS"And the other thing is there will be points where I'll actually literally ask for your"
p90
aS'applause to happen spontaneously, and -- for example, when I introduce each of the'
p91
aS"debaters in a moment, but I'll encourage that applause by doing one of these. It, again,"
p92
aS'would help with the radio broadcast and, as I said before, communicates to the'

aS'side thats arguing for the red states, the side thats arguing, for a better future to live in'

S'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen and thank you so much, John, for the opportunity to'
p267
aS'come to this great event and debate this important topic. Its wonderful to get out of'
p268
aS'Washington D.C., which I call Americans only work free drug zone and lately actually it'
p269
aS'has been a work free drug zone --'
p270
aS'So let me make a few points about why this is such an important topic and why for a'
p271
aS'better life you should move to a red state and I would start with one observation, which'
p272
aS'is that over the last 20 years weve seen in America the biggest shift in wealth in the'
p273
aS'history of this country. Weve also seen a massive change in population of where'
p274
aS'people are living and this has had profound impact in terms of where the growth is in'
p275
aS'this country and where its not happening, and so if you look over the last 20 years'
p276
aS'theres been about 30 to 40 million people who have moved addresses, moved from'
p277
aS'one state to another and over that same time period about two trillion dollars of wealth'
p278
aS'and income have moved from one state to another on that.'
p279
aS'This according to Travis Brown who has written a great book about how money walks,'
p280
aS'and if you look at those statistics and you look at where people are moving to and'
p281
aS'where people are moving from it is incontrovertible that people are leaving blue states'
p282
aS'and they are moving to red states. Now some of this of course is due to things like'
p283
aS'weather, people are moving away from the north east especially as we become an aging'
p284
aS'society and are moving to states like Florida, and Georgia, and North Carolina and South'
p285
aS'Carolina, no question about it weather has a big impact here. But its happening all over'
p286
aS'this country. Not just moving to better weather states. In fact if you look at the'
p287
aS'statistics, an amazing statistic about California -- and I agree with Gray Davis, what a'
p288
aS'wonderful state this is -- how do you screw it up so much? You know how does the state'
p289
aS'get so screwed up that people have actually started to move out of this wonderful'
p290
aS'paradise? Over the last five years one million jobs, roughly -- these arent exact'
p291
aS'numbers, but roughly one million jobs have been lost in California, and over that same'
p292
aS'time period one million jobs have been gained in the state of Texas.'
p293
aS'Thats an amazing statistic. You want to talk about a transfer of wealth and politic'
p294
aS'power its leaving California, its going to Texas. Now I would submit to you that people'
p295
aS'are not leaving places like Los Angeles and San Diego to go to Houston for the weather.'
p296
aS'Theyre not doing that, right? Theyre moving there because thats where the'
p297
aS'opportunity is, thats where the jobs are. Thats where the kind of free enterprise'
p298
aS'systems flourish. And by the way just to continue with this Texas-California comparison,'
p299
aS'because I think well make this a lot throughout the debate because Texas is a'
p300
aS'prototypical red state, and California is a prototypical blue state, the poverty rate is'
p301
aS'California is not 40 percent higher than it is in Texas, which is amazing. People are'
p302
aS'always bad mouthing Texas, Oh they dont even have plumbing in Texas and so on,'
p303
aS'the truth is Texas is actually getting very rich, California not so much so.'
p304
aS'Second point to make that you should all ponder. We are all living through, right now,'
p305
aS'what I call the biggest kind of political, cultural, and economic divide in this country'
p306
aS'perhaps anytime since the civil war. And what youre seeing -- to put it very simply if'
p307
aS'you look at the last few elections is that the red states are getting redder, and the blue'
p308
aS'states are getting bluer. And there is absolutely no question about it. If you look at'
p309
aS'whats happened, for example, in the Southern states every election for the last four or'
p310
aS'five election cycles they get more and more Republican, for better or worse, and thats'
p311
aS'also true of the blue states. I hail from the state of Illinois; I love the Chicago area; I love'
p312
aS'the State of Illinois. What has happened in Illinois over the last 25 years is one of the'
p313
aS'great tragedies of our country. Illinois has gone to the pits in just about every single'
p314
aS'area. It has huge unfunded liabilities. High unemployment rate, the dingbats in'
p315
aS'Springfield just raised the income tax rate by 67 percent.'
p316
aS'One of my favorite kinds of modern politicians Mitch Daniels, a couple years ago when'
p317
aS'he was governor was asked about what it was like being a neighboring state of Illinois,'
p318
aS'and just put it so well he said To be a neighboring state of Illinois in Indiana is like living'
p319
aS'down the street from the Simpsons. I thought that is a great way to put it. And so we'
p320
aS'are seeing incredible dysfunction in these blue states, and its a tragedy by the way. And'
p321
aS'then you ask the question Why are people moving from blue states to red states? And'
p322
aS'I would submit to you the answer is very clear from the evidence why people are'
p323
aS'moving. The two biggest factors, according to all the academic and economic research,'
p324
aS'are number one: if a state is a right to work state, that is that they do not force unions in'
p325
aS'their state, and allow every worker to have the right to choose whether they want to'
p326
aS'join a union or not, those states are flourishing. And one of the fun things about'
p327
aS'working at the Wall Street journal, we talk to business owners all the time, big and'
p328
aS'small, from the corporate fortune 100 companies to small entrepreneurial companies,'
p329
aS'they always tell us when theyre talking about setting up a new plant or a new'
p330
aS'warehouse the first question they ask about a state where theyre going to locate is is it'
p331
aS'a right to work state?'
p332
aS'Because it its not a right to work state its simply, they just take it off the list. No matter'
p333
aS'how many other kind of incentive systems they might have to move there, if youre not'
p334
aS'a right to work state youre just not in the game to get these new enterprises. By the'
p335
aS'way people are always talking about America losing its auto industry, and auto jobs.'
p336
aS'You know Americas not losing its auto jobs, its just the auto jobs arent in states like'
p337
aS'Ohio and Michigan anymore. The auto jobs are now in the South, right? And thats'
p338
aS'partly because of the fact that those are right to work states. The second factor that'
p339
aS'matters a whole heck of a lot is whether a state has no income tax, or low income taxes.'
p340
aS'And we find this to be highly predictable for where people move. And so for example in'
p341
aS'this great country of ours there are nine states that have no income tax.'
p342
aS'States like Texas, states like Florida, states like Tennessee, states like Wyoming, states'
p343
aS'like Nevada, states like Washington. Those states over the last 10, 20, 30 years no'
p344
aS'matter what kind of period you want to look at, have been producing about two to'
p345
aS'three times a many jobs per year as the nine or 10 states that have --'

p413
aS'this proposition. As Steve indicated, this red state/blue state deal is really not so much'
p414
aS'about geography as it is about a state of mind. And those of us in the blue states have a'
p415
aS'different idea about economic development. We believe John Kennedy had it right'
p416
aS'when he said, "A rising tide will lift all boats," because we try and provide economic'
p417
aS'opportunity for everybody, and we do that with four simple ideas.'
p418
aS'One, invest in education. Invest in infrastructure. Protect the environment and have a'
p419
aS'stable safety net. We think that all makes economic sense. We think it is morally the'
p420
aS'right thing to do. And the numbers prove that we are right. If you look at the top 10'
p421
aS'states by average income, nine, nine are blue, one is red. If you look at the top 10 states'
p422
aS'by gross domestic product, eight are blue, two are red. If you look at the bottom 10'
p423
aS'states by gross domestic product, nine are red, one is blue. Beyond just economics, if'
p424
aS"you live in a blue state you're going to live longer, you're going to be healthier, you're"
p425
aS"probably going to have a college degree, and you're going to have more opportunity."
p426
aS'Now, let me talk a little bit about California, which is definitely a blue state, but was not'
p427
aS'before 1992. But today it is really a blue state. Despite what our critics say, these are'
p428
aS'indisputable facts. California has more Fortune 500 companies headquartered than any'
p429
aS'other state, 54. California is the leading manufacturing state by far in America, both by'
p430
aS'jobs and total dollar output; in 2011, $230 billion. California is the largest agricultural'
p431
aS'state in America by dollar output. California created more jobs last year than Texas, and'
p432
aS'more jobs in the last year than anyone in the nation. Most importantly, people believe'
p433
aS'in California and they invest their dollars. California gets more direct investment from'
p434
aS'other countries than any other state.'
p435
aS"And this is the statistic that's going to blow your mind. On venture capital, that's people"
p436
aS'putting their money in start-ups, in 2011, the last year we have statistics for, California'
p437
aS'got more venture capital than all the other 49 states put together, and it got more'
p438
aS'money from foreign countries investing in California. So, people are putting their'
p439
aS'money where they think they can get the best return and they believe that best return'
p440
aS'is in California. My point is, to live well, to be healthy, to have more opportunity, to be'
p441
aS'better educated, you want to live in a blue state. Vote no on the proposition that'
p442
aS'someone has to force you to move to a red state to live well.'

p490
aS'think many of you will know or be familiar, because many of you share in common with'
p491
aS'me a friend, Dr. Jack Templeton. Jack likes thought experiments, right? Youve been in'
p492
aS'those thought experiments with Jack where you reframe the question. Heres how Im'
p493
aS'going to reframe it for you, if your son and daughter approaches you and says Mom,'
p494
aS'Dad, my company, the government, the military, has come to me and said Im getting'
p495
aS'moved one more time. Theyre in their 20s. And theyre going to drop me into a blue'
p496
aS'state or a red state, I get to pick blue or red. I dont get to pick the city, I dont get to'
p497
aS'pick the state, I dont get to pick rural or urban, I dont get to pick suburban or where in'
p498
aS'that state, I just get to pick blue or red, what do you think? Its kind of a Rawlsian'
p499
aS'construct, right? You dont know where theyre going to end up just red or blue. Four'
p500
aS'reasons to say to him son or daughter, red.'
p501
aS'Number one, when you get there, youre going to want to buy a house, California is 200'
p502
aS'percent above the median cost in the average house in America. California is below that'
p503
aS'median. New York is 150 percent. Highest mortgage debt is in California, highest'
p504
aS'mortgage debt is in the District of Columbia. You want your child to be able to buy a'
p505
aS'house and begin that American dream, send them to a red state. Number two, youre'
p506
aS'going to want them to have kids, right? You want to be grandparents. Everybody wants'
p507
aS'to be a grandparent, I just became a grandparent; its a great thing. Guess where the'
p508
aS'fertility is? Guess where people are actually having families and babies, the top 10 most'
p509
aS'fertile states are red.'
p510
aS'The 10 least fertile states are blue. I want to read that blue list to you, because it really'
p511
aS'is blue, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts,'
p512
aS'Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, theyre going to way of Russia and Spain, they will'
p513
aS'not be there in 10 years because theyre not any children.'
p514
aS'But more importantly -- actually thats just an indication of other things. Volunteerism'
p515
aS'is spread out evenly across red and blue states, but not charitable giving. As you will'
p516
aS'know nine out of the 10 most charitable states in the union are red.'
p517
aS'Now of course we got Utah and Idaho and weve got the Mormon tide to drive them'
p518
aS'that way but the other seven are not. They are, however--whats that an indication of?'
p519
aS'Religiosity and not merely checked off religiosity, but genuine confirmation of religious'
p520
aS'belief. Red state advantage huge on charitable giving. Number three though when you'
p521
aS'get there and you have these kids and you got your grandchildren, theyre going to have'
p522
aS'to drive around a lot, theyre going to have actual practical things to think about in the'
p523
aS'course of their lives. Number one, think about the number of times youve pulled into a'
p524
aS'gas station, the number of times over the life of your child is making that red, blue state'
p525
aS'decision, theyre going to pull into a gas station. Its a good proxy for the practical cost'
p526
aS'of living, gas prices are phenomenally lower in red states, and there are reasons for that,'
p527
aS'proximity of refinery, production of the basic materials, bigger in red states. Red states'
p528
aS'are energy productive. When I was talking to Steven beforehand and he said you take'
p529
aS'the economics and Ill take the social stuff.'
p530
aS'We didnt really say where energy would fit, I thought maybe he would talk about'
p531
aS'energy production, but then I began to think its really proxy for the willingness to go'
p532
aS'and grow with what youve got to make it better and then finally those grandchildren of'
p533
aS'yours are going to need to be educated. Whos doing the best? Now Michael Lind is a'
p534
aS'very experienced and savvy debater and he will throw statistics at you that will not'
p535
aS'make sense, thats what they do from that side.'
p536
aS'But you listen very carefully to his statistics about education because he cannot defeat'
p537
aS'this one from the national education assessment study. The most underprivileged kids'
p538
aS'when it comes to education are African Americans and Latinos. The most important'
p539
aS'manifestation of educational success is bringing the bottom to the middle. The most'
p540
aS'important element of that is math and the most important grade is eight. That is the'
p541
aS'turning point where the skill set transfers over into the employment probability and'
p542
aS'possibility of those children. In the NEAS, the state that is now number two that has'
p543
aS'made the most progress over the last decade is Texas for blacks and for Latinos, they'
p544
aS'have rocketed up.'
p545
aS'Do you know what state is number 49? This one. Why is that? Its because education,'
p546
aS'innovation is occurring in the red states. Why is that? Because they are not in the'
p547
aS'death grip of special interests that prevent the exploration of the new and the effective.'
p548
aS'Thats why if you had to pick where your grandchildren were going to be educated and'
p549
aS'you could not guarantee that theyre going to a private but they are going to go into a'
p550
aS'public school. You would pick a red state. If you were a grandma or grandpa who'
p551
aS'wanted to give them the best advantage of an exploding opportunity in the education'
p552
aS'arena. Now as I warn you again, Michael will come up and bring up SAT scores or ACT'
p553
aS'scores, and I will give him that, theyre higher in the blue states. Youve got some legacy'
p554
aS'investments in the blue state. Youve got some wonderful cultural advantages. You'
p555
aS'might be thinking I want my grandchild to live in San Francisco. No you dont get to'
p556
aS'pick that. This is Rawlsian. Theyre just going to go red or blue. And if you really want'
p557
aS'to think that through youre going to pick red every single time. Thank you.'

(lp582
S'I think Im a pretty good debater, but Im not as good at lowering expectations as Hugh'
p583
aS'Hewitt. The motion is For a better future, live in a red state. As a native Texan I'
p584
aS'would love to endorse this motion. Texas does indeed lead California and much of the'
p585
aS'rest of the country in a number of indices. Its number on when it comes to barbeque.'
p586
aS'Its much better than that pork based stuff they have eastwards. Its number six when it'
p587
aS'comes to housing affordability, and I suspect this will come up again and again and'
p588
aS'again. Because one of the issues among us is the relative importance of housing'
p589
aS'affordability as opposed to personal income taxes and business taxes in explaining'
p590
aS'migration.'
p591
aS'So thats the good news. Heres the bad news for the state of Texas, and why it is not'
p592
aS'indeed surpassing California, New York, and other leading blue states, and probably will'
p593
aS'not do so within my lifetime: Texas is number one in uninsured adults. It is number 50'
p594
aS'in high school graduates. I defer to Hugh on the rapid progress of African Americans'
p595
aS'and Latinos in Texas. Thats coming from a very, very low base, lets face it. When it'
p596
aS'comes to uninsured children, Texas is number two. We heard a lot about fertility in'
p597
aS'Texas, and thats true in the south and southwest in general, for ethnic and religious'
p598
aS'reasons. Texas on a scale from one to 50 is number 49 when it comes to prenatal care'
p599
aS'for pregnant women. So yes more women are pregnant, but they get absolutely'
p600
aS'abysmal prenatal care compared to most of the blue states.'
p601
aS'Just a couple more points on what Stephen raised. He said that $2 trillion has moved'
p602
aS'across state lines in the last 20 years. Well the average GDP in the U.S. annually is 14 or'
p603
aS'15 trillion if Im not mistaken, so by my off the envelope calculations, thats less than'
p604
aS'one percent of GDP over the last 20 years. This is not a terribly strong argument for'
p605
aS'their side if you ask me. The amount of migration from Texas -- from California to Texas'
p606
aS'is also very easy to exaggerate. Texans move to California just as Californians move to'
p607
aS'Texas. Between July of 2011 and July of 2012 a grand total of 22,000 more Californians'
p608
aS'moved to Texas than Texas moved the other way. The number was 17,000 surplus for'
p609
aS'Texas and New York. Were talking about less than 0.01 percent of the US population in'
p610
aS'every case.'
p611
aS'What is more, the lower your income, the less likely -- the more likely you are to move'
p612
aS'from California to Texas. Now why is this important? It undercuts the thesis that high'
p613
aS'progressive income taxes are driving out Californians. Because if that were true you'
p614
aS'would expect to see an exodus of rich Californians. What youre seeing instead is an'
p615
aS'exodus of working class and lower middle class Californians and we know why. There'
p616
aS'are two factors. Theres the push factor, which was the housing bubble in California. It'
p617
aS'took place almost exclusively in blue states, mainly because rich people, after the tech'
p618
aS'bubble bottomed out, were looking for new and safe assets. And they had more'
p619
aS'confidence in the economic future of property assets going up in places like California, in'
p620
aS'New York, in Florida than they did in Texas and the south. So by dramatically raising the'
p621
aS'cost of living in the blue states that did force out a lot of working class people.'
p622
aS'Often -- not to the south and Texas and the Great Plains, but to states neighboring. For'
p623
aS'example a lot of the working class people who have moved for housing affordability,'
p624
aS'have gone to other blue states like Oregon and Washington on the west coast. Theyre'
p625
aS'just cheaper than California. And you see a similar spill over affect elsewhere. The poll'
p626
aS'factor that is creating so many of these jobs in Texas is the energy industry. And if you'
p627
aS"look at the red states in general, where this is taking place. It's in this energy corridor"
p628
aS'where thanks to fracking from the Bakken shale up in the Dakotas all the way down to'
p629
aS'Texas to the Eagle Ford shale, you see a tremendous explosion of energy. It lowers'
p630
aS'energy prices. It helps manufacturing, all of that. That is an accident of geography plus'
p631
aS'regulatory and technological factors. If the blue states who have energy resources like'
p632
aS'California and New York, were actually to, with some environmental safeguards to'
p633
aS'emulate these red states, you would see enormous amounts of wealth pouring into the'
p634
aS'blue states on top of their advantages.'
p635
aS'So, we agree on many things. One of the things we agree on is that the south in'
p636
aS'particular has been gaining population ever since World War II, thanks mainly to air'
p637
aS'conditioning and to retirement -- that will continue indefinitely. The basic question, I'
p638
aS'think, is not which states are picking up the most people or the most footloose'
p639
aS'corporations, but where are you most likely to have health care, to have decent'
p640
aS"education, to graduate from high school, and to have quality of life if you're an ordinary"
p641
aS'high school educated working American? And in that case I think the answer is clear.'
p642
aS'You would rather be in a blue state than a red state. Thank you.'

p662
aS"two. That's where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from"
p663
aS'you in the audience and from me. We have two teams of two arguing for and against'
p664
aS'this motion: "For a Better Future, Live in a Red State. Hugh Hewitt and Stephen Moore'
p665
aS'are arguing for the red states. They argue that we already see the evidence that the'
p666
aS'American population is making this decision with its feet, because of the big shift in'
p667
aS'population since World War II, but more recently and increasingly, a large shift in wealth'
p668
aS"going to the red states. They say the reasons people are moving, they're moving for the"
p669
aS'right to work. They are moving attracted by lower income taxes, by the ability to buy'
p670
aS'homes, that there are indicators like fertility, which is on a rampage in the red states,'
p671
aS'and that all in all the message is the dynamic is moving very much in the favor of the red'
p672
aS'states.'
p673
aS'The team arguing against them, Gray Davis and Michael Lind, argue by bringing forth a'
p674
aS'set of statistics that show us a snapshot of all sorts of advantages already accruing to'
p675
aS'residents of blue states. Blue states have higher average income. People in blue states'
p676
aS'are living longer. They are more likely to have a college degree, and to be healthier, and'
p677
aS'they dispute the notion that people are moving to the red states for benefits, such as'
p678
aS'lower income taxes. Texas and the southern states, you just heard, offer air'
p679
aS"conditioning, and that may be what's drawing people more than the lower taxes,"
p680
aS"because the portion of the population that's moving to these states wouldn't actually be"
p681
aS"benefiting from lower taxes, because they're just not paid enough. So I want to take a"
p682
aS"question to the side that's arguing against the motion for the blue states. This is a tricky"
p683
aS"debate, because both sides are coming at us with dueling statistics and it's a fairly easy"
p684
aS'thing to pick and choose, but as I did just point out, you presented, Gray Davis and'
p685
aS'Michael Lind arguing for the blue states, a snapshot of several ways in which already if'
p686
aS"you're in a blue state you're better off for various reasons, but your opponents, I think,"
p687

aS'the red states, but will continue to provide a model, because the revealed preference,'

aS'as Hugh Hewitt says, is the fact that when they move to red states like Texas, the'

aS'overwhelming number of new migrants are going to blue cities. Cities that vote liberal'

aS'and vote democratic. Like Dallas, Austin and Houston, which as a result of this'

p2273
aS'actually made the case that I think we were done after round one. I really would like'

aS'1998, the year that Governor Davis was elected, we passed one of our propositions,'

aS'who took an enormous amount of heat for attempting to change the basic paradigm of'

aS'his state. In order to make these pressing new problems, which are global and'
p2288
aS'transformative, you have to have political systems that will move, and will be nimble'
