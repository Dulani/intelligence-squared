aS'Do wewant to keep the First Amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to saysomething else?'
p404

p407
aS"The part that we're talking about tonight isCongress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech."
p408
aS"Well, I'm sorry to inform thatwe have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech.The Supreme Court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on politicalspeech."
p409
aS'We have laws and regulations that come to -- close to 400,000 words.'
p410
aS'Butthese words are not clear enough so the Federal Election Commission has already issuedclose to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means.And on top of that, there have been nearly eight -- 7,000 enforcement actions by theFederal Election Commission during its history.'
p411
aS'To really understand the law, you needto understand all that.'
p412
aS'And the fact is no one does understand what the election lawmeans.'
p413
aS'In fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire alawyer like this one over here.'
p414
aS"I don't know how much he charges, but most grassrootsgroups probably can't afford it.And if they don't have a lawyer, they're probably going to make mistakes."
p415
aS'I lived underthis, working at a political committee.'
p416
aS"I saw the regulations firsthand, and we -- a lot ofthis we're getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn't getan answer to many of our basic questions."
p417
aS'On top of that, in 2002 Congress passed theMcCain-Feingold Act, and for many of us that was the last straw.'
p418
aS'A portion of that -- notall of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive nomatter what our views on politics.'
p419
aS'Part of it said that within 60 days of an election, agroup that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the nameof a congressman if it aired on radio or TV.'
p420
aS'That was illegal.Now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that.'
p421
aS'Ithought that was outrageous.'
p422
aS'And there is no group fighting on the political front forthe First Amendment.We hear about groups fighting for Second Amendment rights but not First Amendmentrights.'
p423
aS"That's why I started SpeechNow.org because I think we need a group to fight forour political free speech rights."
p424
aS'Now, I designed this group in a way that I thoughtwould allow us to be effective.'
p425
aS"In fact, one of our panelists who doesn't support freespeech -- unfettered free speech has adopted the SpeechNow.org model, which is nowcalled a super PAC."
p426
aS"And basically here's how it works."
p427
aS"It's Americans getting togetherand pooling their money."
p428
aS'I talk to you.'
p429
aS'I make the case as to why you should donatemoney, so then we can talk to other Americans.'
p430
aS"That's what the SpeechNow modelwas."
p431
aS'There was only one problem with it.'
p432
aS'It was illegal to do that.'
p433
aS'So theSpeechNow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued theFDC, to make a long story short, we won.That case, SpeechNow.org versus FDC, is what created the super PAC.'
p434
aS'Now, let meexplain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different fromnormal PACs.'
p435
aS'These are different from political parties.'
p436
aS'These are literally Americansgetting together independently.'
p437
aS'The Federal Election Commission calls these groups"independent expenditure only committees" because that\'s all they can do.'
p438
aS"We don'tmake any donations to candidates."
p439
aS"We dont make any donations to political parties.We don't coordinate our speech with the candidates."
p440
aS"We don't coordinate our speechwith the political parties."
p441
aS'All of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on theInternet on the FDC website.'
p442
aS'And all of our spending is donated -- is reported as well.That is what the media has come to call a "super PAC.'
p443
aS'"So when you think about it, what\'s wrong with that?'
p444
aS'It\'s basically a group of peoplegetting together and saying, "Hey, we want to speak to our fellow Americans aboutwhat direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, whoshould represent us, and we\'re not going to give any money to the candidates or theparties.'
p445
aS'" That\'s what a super PAC is.'
p446
aS'Now, this model has been so popular that thereare now 805 of them that have formed since June of 2010 when super PACs firstbecame legal.Now, I want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech.'
p447
aS'And Iwill go back to 1967, when a U.S. senator named Gene McCarthy wanted to run forpresident.'
p448
aS'The incumbent president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a very powerfulpolitical figure.'
p449
aS"Today most people would think it'd be impossible to take down a sittingpresident in a primary, especially if you started in November previous to the electionyear.But Gene McCarthy did it."
p450
aS'And you know how he did it?'
p451
aS"He went to a handful ofpeople, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today's dollars of $10 million,$10 million.Now, that's the kind of money that we're talking about in super PACs, but back then, themoney went directly into Gene McCarthy's campaign committee."
p452
aS'Gene McCarthy wasopposed to the Vietnam War.'
p453
aS'He wanted to make his run for president based onopposing the Vietnam War.'
p454
aS'And he wanted to help build a movement to help end theVietnam War.'
p455
aS"He couldn't have done it without those contributions."
p456
aS"He couldn't havedone it."
p457
aS'And you know what?'
p458
aS'He did it.'
p459
aS"He didn't win the nomination, but he forcedLBJ out of the race."
p460
aS"And it's the only time since -- since we've passed these campaignrestrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger.And I daresay it probably won't happen for many, many years."
p461
aS'So if you believe in theright of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to doeverything they can to speak to other Americans.'

p582
aS'What we have learned over the last 200 years, by sad experience, is that our government can be corrupted by campaign money so that it primarily responds to the sources of money that fund elections -- special interests and big political contributors and spenders -- rather than representing the people and seeking the common good.'
p583

aS'Theodore Roosevelt began this national discussion in 1905 after being elected president with huge contributions from Wall Street.'
p586
aS'He actually had Mark Hanna.'
p587
aS'And Mark Hanna had what we would call super PAC money, unlimited contributions from corporations that elected Roosevelt.'
p588
aS'Afterwards, those corporations came to him for their reward which they expected would be less government regulation.'
p589
aS'Roosevelt responded by saying to Congress, "All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law.'
p590
aS"Directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes."
p591
aS'" Later, he said, "Every special interest is entitled to justice, but none is entitled to a vote in Congress to a voice on the bench.'
p592
aS'" Congress reacted to Roosevelt\'s call by passing the Tillman Act in 1907 forbidding corporate political contributions in federal elections.'
p593
aS'Later in 1947, the Taft Act extended this prohibition to labor unions and to independent expenditures.'
p594
aS'Roosevelt and the Congress believed that the election of representatives of the people to Congress should be left to individual citizens and voters, not corporate or union interests almost always seeking special legislative favors in return.'
p595
aS'Under President Richard Nixon, these prohibitions were violated because of a lack of disclosure.'
p596
aS'Then in the Watergate scandal, these hidden violations became public.'
p597
aS'We learned that the Department of Justice had dropped an antitrust case against ITT in return for $400,000 given to finance the Republican convention where Nixon wanted it.'
p598
aS'We might never have known that except an ITT lobbyist wrote it all down in an internal memo which then saw the light of day.'
p599
aS'The result was that after Watergate, Congress passed new reform laws and tried to require the disclosure of all money given for political purposes.'
p600
aS'These laws were later revised and strengthened in the McCain- Feingold law in 2002.'
p601
aS"As Senator Alan Simpson said at that time, too often members' first thought is not what is right or what they will believe, but how it will affect fundraising."
p602
aS'Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue?'
p603
aS'The goal of each of these laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action or inaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns.'
p604
aS'Just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption.'
p605
aS'As the Supreme Court said in the Buckley case in 1976, Congress has the right to deal with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permitting unlimited financial contributions.'
p606
aS'The Supreme Court also recognized one other reality in that case which is central to our debate today.'
p607
aS'There is a significant difference between my speaking myself or giving my money to someone else for their speech.'
p608
aS'My own speech and my own words has higher First Amendment protection than a contribution.'
p609
aS'That brings us to the world of super PACs.'
p610
aS"They were created, as we heard, by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision and the DC circuit's SpeechNow case."
p611
aS'The majority in Citizens United, overturning previous decisions, said that in their view of the First Amendment, corporations had the same right as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal elections because such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.'
p612
aS'The court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can never corrupt on two important predicates.'
p613
aS'The spending must be totally independent of candidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words of Justice Kennedy and Citizens United, the public can see whether elected officials are in the pockets of so-called money interests.'
p614
aS'So are their spending totally independent of candidates?'

aS'The goal of each ofthese laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action orinaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns.Just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption.As the Supreme Court said in the Buckley case in 1976, Congress has the right to dealwith the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permittingunlimited financial contributions.'

aS"That brings us to the world of super PACs.They were created, as we heard, by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision and theDC circuit's SpeechNow case."
p655
aS'The majority in Citizens United, overturning previousdecisions, said that in their view of the First Amendment, corporations had the sameright as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal electionsbecause such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.The court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can nevercorrupt on two important predicates.'
p656
aS'The spending must be totally independent ofcandidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words ofJustice Kennedy and Citizens United, the public can see whether elected officials are inthe pockets of so-called money interests.So are their spending totally independent of candidates?'
p657
aS'Do we have full disclosure?Jonathan Soros will tell us in a few minutes.'

aS"I can see that we're going to have a lot to talk about tonight, but my partner, Trevor Potter, laid out the case for why in response to the First Amendment we still have an important interest in mitigating the corruption that can result from even independent political activity but from in particular from contributions to candidates."
p870
aS'I\'m going to take us on a closer look at the proposition, itself, "Two cheers for super PACs," and suggest that we don\'t even have the rules that super PACs were premised on.'
p871
aS"Mr. Keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super PACs are, but that doesn't really resemble what they are in fact."
p872
aS'After 40 years of Supreme Court intervention, what we have is more loophole than law.'
p873
aS"Let's start with the issue of independence."
p874
aS"As my partner mentioned, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that speech that is independent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted."
p875
aS'Let\'s set aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed up and said, "I\'m going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position X or position Y," that that\'s not going to have some influence on candidates or elected officials.'
p876
aS'We\'ll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what "independent" really means today because the rules around what independent is for super PACs are basically nonexistent.'
p877
aS'There are in effect only two rules that apply.'
p878
aS"One, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and what their resources are with a super PAC, and the super PAC may not give a contribution directly to the campaign."
p879
aS'Obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, like spending lots of money on television.'
p880
aS"There are more rules about what Goldman Sachs' partners can say to each other than there are about what super PACs can say to candidates."
p881
aS"We've all seen the jokes that this leads to."
p882
aS"My partner's super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, has been referenced several times."
p883
aS"It's one of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months."
p884
aS"I would strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it."
p885
aS"It's really funny."
p886
aS"But what we're seeing in that -- and they've provided a tremendous example -- is that there are, in effect, no lines between super PACs and candidates."
p887
aS"Let's just give a couple of examples."
p888
aS'Candidates can raise money for super PACs.'
p889
aS'They can show up at their fundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit.'
p890
aS'But then what happens after they leave?'
p891
aS'Who knows?'
p892
aS'We all know, at least in the presidential election, the super PACs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates, in both instances.'
p893
aS'Candidates can endorse super PACs.'
p894
aS'You hear Mitt Romney talking about "my" super PAC.'
p895
aS"And just in the last couple of weeks, since we've watched the conventions, we heard about Karl Rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to President Bush and to many other Republicans, getting briefings about his super PAC around Tampa."
p896
aS'And last week in Charlotte, Rahm Emmanuel, who had been, at one time, White House chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the Obama campaign, left that position and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention about how he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the Obama-aligned super PAC.'
p897
aS'So, clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke.'
p898
aS"That, in effect, leaving aside what's happened in the super PAC, has undermined something we thought we had before."
p899
aS'We thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very good reason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions to candidates.'
p900
aS'Now, those rules still technically exist.'
p901
aS'You can still only give $2,500 to a candidate.'
p902
aS'You can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party.'
p903
aS"But you can then turn around and give $25 million to a super PAC that's working, essentially, as a surrogate for the campaign."
p904
aS"Though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 are irrelevant to most of the population anyway."
p905
aS"It's only 1 percent of 1 percent of the population that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities."
p906
aS"Well, now, with super PACs, we've seen that shrink even further."
p907
aS'So 200 people account for 80 percent of the money that was raised for Super PACs, at least as of the last filing.'
p908
aS"Lastly, let's talk about transparency."
p909
aS"It's true; super PACs do have to disclose their donors and their expenditures."
p910

aS"But there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollars through, right?"
p912
aS"You don't have to give your political money to a super PAC."
p913
aS"You can give your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations can give them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as super PACs can do, and they don't have to disclose their donors."
p914
aS'So when people say, "How much money is being spent in this election?'
p915
aS'" the answer is, "We actually don\'t really know.'
p916
aS'" We know that it will be more than ever before, but we don\'t know exactly how much, and we don\'t know exactly where it\'s coming from.'
p917
aS'These are problems that can be addressed.'
p918
aS"We can have rules on transparency that address disclosure of all political spending that's related to the election."
p919
aS"We can have rules, coherent rules, around independence that require that super PACs are at least an arm's length distance from the campaigns."
p920
aS"We need a functioning enforcement agency, and I hope that we'll have a chance to talk a little bit about the dysfunction of the FCC later on."
p921

p923
aS"Shows you everything that's spewing into the Gulf, but it doesn't do anything to fix it."
p924
aS'We need an alternative.'
p925
aS'We need a system of citizen- funded elections that allow candidates to run for political office without dependence on large contributions and big donors.'
p926
aS"That's commonly known as public financing, but when you think about it as a system that is designed to change the incentives of candidates, then it becomes something slightly different."
p927
aS"If you think about a system we have in New York where, if you're participating in the system, $175 contribution is matched six-to-one."

p944
aS"Keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super PACs are, but that doesn't reallyresemble what they are in fact."
p945
aS'After 40 years of Supreme Court intervention, what wehave is more loophole than law.'
p946
aS"Let's start with the issue of independence."
p947
aS"As mypartner mentioned, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that speech that isindependent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted."
p948
aS'Let\'sset aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed upand said, "I\'m going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position Xor position Y," that that\'s not going to have some influence on candidates or electedofficials.'
p949
aS'We\'ll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what "independent" reallymeans today because the rules around what independent is for super PACs are basicallynonexistent.'
p950
aS"There are in effect only two rules that apply.One, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and whattheir resources are with a super PAC, and the super PAC may not give a contributiondirectly to the campaign."
p951
aS'Obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, likespending lots of money on television.'
p952
aS"There are more rules about what Goldman Sachs'partners can say to each other than there are about what super PACs can say tocandidates."
p953
aS"We've all seen the jokes that this leads to."
p954
aS"My partner's super PAC,Americans for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, has been referenced several times."
p955
aS"It'sone of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months."
p956
aS"Iwould strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it."
p957
aS"It's really funny.But what we're seeing in that -- and they've provided a tremendous example -- is thatthere are, in effect, no lines between super PACs and candidates."
p958
aS"Let's just give a coupleof examples."
p959
aS'Candidates can raise money for super PACs.'
p960
aS'They can show up at theirfundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit.But then what happens after they leave?'
p961
aS'Who knows?'
p962
aS'We all know, at least in thepresidential election, the super PACs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates,in both instances.'
p963
aS'Candidates can endorse super PACs.'
p964
aS'You hear Mitt Romney talkingabout "my" super PAC.'
p965
aS"And just in the last couple of weeks, since we've watched theconventions, we heard about Karl Rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to PresidentBush and to many other Republicans, getting briefings about his super PAC aroundTampa."
p966
aS'And last week in Charlotte, Rahm Emmanuel, who had been, at one time, WhiteHouse chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the Obama campaign, left thatposition and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention abouthow he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the Obama-aligned super PAC.'
p967
aS'So,clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke.'
p968
aS"That, in effect, leaving asidewhat's happened in the super PAC, has undermined something we thought we hadbefore.We thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very goodreason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions tocandidates."
p969
aS'Now, those rules still technically exist.'
p970
aS'You can still only give $2,500 to acandidate.'
p971
aS'You can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party.'
p972
aS"But you canthen turn around and give $25 million to a super PAC that's working, essentially, as asurrogate for the campaign."
p973
aS"Though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 areirrelevant to most of the population anyway."
p974
aS"It's only 1 percent of 1 percent of thepopulation that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities."
p975
aS"Well, now, with superPACs, we've seen that shrink even further."
p976
aS"So 200 people account for 80 percent of themoney that was raised for Super PACs, at least as of the last filing.Lastly, let's talk about transparency."
p977
aS"It's true; super PACs do have to disclose theirdonors and their expenditures.Transparency is something that the Supreme Court speaks glowingly of in CitizensUnited and other cases."
p978
aS"But there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollarsthrough, right?"
p979
aS"You don't have to give your political money to a super PAC."
p980
aS"You cangive your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations cangive them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as superPACs can do, and they don't have to disclose their donors."
p981

aS'So why was that, Citizens United, not a media corporation?'
p3127
aS'The NRA started a radio show, daily radio show, after McCain-Feingold was passed, and they said, "Look, we\'re a media corporation; we\'re exempt.'
p3128
aS'" If that\'s legitimate, then why couldn\'t every advocacy group do the same sort of thing?'
p3129
aS'Does the internet count as a medium?'
p3130
aS'Presumably it does.'
p3131
aS"Then doesn't every group that has a website qualify as a media corporation?"
p3132
aS'This media exemption puts the government in the position of deciding who deserves to have unfettered freedom of speech and who does not, which is precisely the sort of distinctions the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit.'
p3133
aS"And whether you're worried about corruption or you're worried about undue influence, the arguments for regulation are just as strong, if not stronger, in the case of media corporations."
p3134
aS"So while many of my fellow journalists have supported these kinds of regulations, basically lobbying to keep their own special speech privileges, it's always seemed foolish to me for people who make a living by talking about politics to appoint the government as a sort of national debate moderator, because you never know when the moderator will decide that it's time for you to shut up."
