(lp269
S'Well, thank you. I think largely what we have tonight is a debate about the First'
p270
aS'Amendment and what it means and whether we still value the First Amendment. Do we'
p271
aS'want to keep the First Amendment the way it was written, or do we want it to say'
p272
aS'something else? And who will say what that "something else" is? First, let\'s review'
p273
aS"what it says. It's pretty simple actually. The part that we're talking about tonight is"
p274
aS"Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. Well, I'm sorry to inform that"
p275
aS'we have a lot of laws abridging freedom of speech and regulating speech.'
p276
aS'The Supreme Court has said there are now 30 different types of regulations on political'
p277
aS'speech. We have laws and regulations that come to -- close to 400,000 words. But'
p278
aS'these words are not clear enough so the Federal Election Commission has already issued'
p279
aS'close to 1,900 advisory opinions that you must review to know what the law means.'
p280
aS'And on top of that, there have been nearly eight -- 7,000 enforcement actions by the'
p281
aS'Federal Election Commission during its history. To really understand the law, you need'
p282
aS'to understand all that. And the fact is no one does understand what the election law'
p283
aS'means. In fact, if you want to speak out about politics and elections you have to hire a'
p284
aS"lawyer like this one over here. I don't know how much he charges, but most grassroots"
p285
aS"groups probably can't afford it."
p286
aS"And if they don't have a lawyer, they're probably going to make mistakes. I lived under"
p287
aS'this, working at a political committee. I saw the regulations firsthand, and we -- a lot of'
p288
aS"this we're getting very upset with how complicated it was and the fact we couldn't get"
p289
aS'an answer to many of our basic questions. On top of that, in 2002 Congress passed the'
p290
aS'McCain-Feingold Act, and for many of us that was the last straw. A portion of that -- not'
p291
aS'all of that law was bad, but there was one portion that many of us found offensive no'
p292
aS'matter what our views on politics. Part of it said that within 60 days of an election, a'
p293
aS'group that you were a member of could not run an advertisement mentioning the name'
p294
aS'of a congressman if it aired on radio or TV. That was illegal.'
p295
aS'Now, the court has overturned that, but it took them a number of years to do that. I'
p296
aS'thought that was outrageous. And there is no group fighting on the political front for'
p297
aS'the First Amendment.'
p298
aS'We hear about groups fighting for Second Amendment rights but not First Amendment'
p299
aS"rights. That's why I started SpeechNow.org because I think we need a group to fight for"
p300
aS'our political free speech rights. Now, I designed this group in a way that I thought'
p301
aS"would allow us to be effective. In fact, one of our panelists who doesn't support free"
p302
aS'speech -- unfettered free speech has adopted the SpeechNow.org model, which is now'
p303
aS"called a super PAC. And basically here's how it works. It's Americans getting together"
p304
aS'and pooling their money. I talk to you. I make the case as to why you should donate'
p305
aS"money, so then we can talk to other Americans. That's what the SpeechNow model"
p306
aS'was. There was only one problem with it. It was illegal to do that. So the'
p307
aS'SpeechNow.org with the assistance of a couple of public interest law firms sued the'
p308
aS'FDC, to make a long story short, we won.'
p309
aS'That case, SpeechNow.org versus FDC, is what created the super PAC. Now, let me'
p310
aS'explain how these groups are actually functioned, because these are different from'
p311
aS'normal PACs. These are different from political parties. These are literally Americans'
p312
aS'getting together independently. The Federal Election Commission calls these groups'
p313
aS'"independent expenditure only committees" because that\'s all they can do. We don\'t'
p314
aS'make any donations to candidates. We dont make any donations to political parties.'
p315
aS"We don't coordinate our speech with the candidates. We don't coordinate our speech"
p316
aS'with the political parties. All of our donors over $200 are disclosed to the public on the'
p317
aS'Internet on the FDC website. And all of our spending is donated -- is reported as well.'
p318
aS'That is what the media has come to call a "super PAC."'
p319
aS"So when you think about it, what's wrong with that? It's basically a group of people"
p320
aS'getting together and saying, "Hey, we want to speak to our fellow Americans about'
p321
aS'what direction we think the country should go, what leaders we should elect, who'
p322
aS"should represent us, and we're not going to give any money to the candidates or the"
p323
aS'parties." That\'s what a super PAC is. Now, this model has been so popular that there'
p324
aS'are now 805 of them that have formed since June of 2010 when super PACs first'
p325
aS'became legal.'
p326
aS'Now, I want to tell you a story of how important money can be in making speech. And I'
p327
aS'will go back to 1967, when a U.S. senator named Gene McCarthy wanted to run for'
p328
aS'president. The incumbent president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a very powerful'
p329
aS"political figure. Today most people would think it'd be impossible to take down a sitting"
p330
aS'president in a primary, especially if you started in November previous to the election'
p331
aS'year.'
p332
aS'But Gene McCarthy did it. And you know how he did it? He went to a handful of'
p333
aS"people, about five people, and they gave the equivalent in today's dollars of $10 million,"
p334
aS'$10 million.'
p335
aS"Now, that's the kind of money that we're talking about in super PACs, but back then, the"
p336
aS"money went directly into Gene McCarthy's campaign committee. Gene McCarthy was"
p337
aS'opposed to the Vietnam War. He wanted to make his run for president based on'
p338
aS'opposing the Vietnam War. And he wanted to help build a movement to help end the'
p339
aS"Vietnam War. He couldn't have done it without those contributions. He couldn't have"
p340
aS"done it. And you know what? He did it. He didn't win the nomination, but he forced"
p341
aS"LBJ out of the race. And it's the only time since -- since we've passed these campaign"
p342
aS'restrictions, we have never seen a sitting president removed by a challenger.'
p343
aS"And I daresay it probably won't happen for many, many years. So if you believe in the"
p344
aS'right of the people to change their government, we have to give people the right to do'
p345
aS'everything they can to speak to other Americans. And independent political groups are'
p346
aS'the way to do it. Thank you.'

aS'celebrate the importance of the First Amendment, the right each of us has as citizens to'
p378
aS'criticize the government and speak freely. We are all American patriots in this room'
p379
aS'tonight, not supporters of King George III. None of us believe that the crown, or our'
p380
aS'government, should be free of criticism. But our opponents want this to begin and end'
p381
aS'as a debate about the First Amendment, and only about their view of the First'
p382
aS'Amendment. They want to ignore the rest of the Constitution and the functioning of'
p383
aS'the government that we the people created. The Constitution created a congress that'
p384
aS'represents the will of the people, the voters.'
p385
aS'It created a president whose job is to faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress.'
p386
aS'What we have learned over the last 200 years, by sad experience, is that our'
p387
aS'government can be corrupted by campaign money so that it primarily responds to the'
p388
aS'sources of money that fund elections -- special interests and big political contributors'
p389
aS'and spenders -- rather than representing the people and seeking the common good.'
p390
aS"So tonight I'm going to look at how campaign money can corrupt our government and"
p391
aS'why, for 100 years, there have been limits on money spent in politics to try and control'
p392
aS'that corruption. Then, my debating partner Jonathan Soros will explain why super PACs'
p393
aS'and their related nonprofit C4s and C6s only make the possibility of corruption greater.'
p394
aS'Theodore Roosevelt began this national discussion in 1905 after being elected president'
p395
aS'with huge contributions from Wall Street. He actually had Mark Hanna. And Mark'
p396
aS'Hanna had what we would call super PAC money, unlimited contributions from'
p397
aS'corporations that elected Roosevelt. Afterwards, those corporations came to him for'
p398
aS'their reward which they expected would be less government regulation. Roosevelt'
p399
aS'responded by saying to Congress, "All contributions by corporations to any political'
p400
aS'committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law. Directors should not'
p401
aS'be permitted to use stockholders\' money for such purposes." Later, he said, "Every'
p402
aS'special interest is entitled to justice, but none is entitled to a vote in Congress to a voice'
p403
aS'on the bench."'
p404
aS"Congress reacted to Roosevelt's call by passing the Tillman Act in 1907 forbidding"
p405
aS'corporate political contributions in federal elections. Later in 1947, the Taft Act'
p406
aS'extended this prohibition to labor unions and to independent expenditures. Roosevelt'
p407
aS'and the Congress believed that the election of representatives of the people to Congress'
p408
aS'should be left to individual citizens and voters, not corporate or union interests almost'
p409
aS'always seeking special legislative favors in return. Under President Richard Nixon, these'
p410
aS'prohibitions were violated because of a lack of disclosure. Then in the Watergate'
p411
aS'scandal, these hidden violations became public. We learned that the Department of'
p412
aS'Justice had dropped an antitrust case against ITT in return for $400,000 given to finance'
p413
aS'the Republican convention where Nixon wanted it.'
p414
aS'We might never have known that except an ITT lobbyist wrote it all down in an internal'
p415
aS'memo which then saw the light of day. The result was that after Watergate, Congress'
p416
aS'passed new reform laws and tried to require the disclosure of all money given for'
p417
aS'political purposes. These laws were later revised and strengthened in the McCain-'
p418
aS"Feingold law in 2002. As Senator Alan Simpson said at that time, too often members'"
p419
aS'first thought is not what is right or what they will believe, but how it will affect'
p420
aS'fundraising. Who, after all, can seriously contend that a $100,000 donation does not'
p421
aS'alter the way one thinks about and quite possibly votes on an issue? The goal of each of'
p422
aS'these laws was to prevent actual corruption, the selling of government action or'
p423
aS'inaction in return for financial support for candidates and campaigns.'
p424
aS'Just as important, though, has been the goal of avoiding the appearance of corruption.'
p425
aS'As the Supreme Court said in the Buckley case in 1976, Congress has the right to deal'
p426
aS'with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in the system, permitting'
p427
aS'unlimited financial contributions. The Supreme Court also recognized one other reality'
p428
aS'in that case which is central to our debate today. There is a significant difference'
p429
aS'between my speaking myself or giving my money to someone else for their speech. My'
p430
aS'own speech and my own words has higher First Amendment protection than a'
p431
aS'contribution. That brings us to the world of super PACs.'
p432
aS'They were created, as we heard, by the Supreme Court Citizens United decision and the'
p433
aS"DC circuit's SpeechNow case. The majority in Citizens United, overturning previous"
p434
aS'decisions, said that in their view of the First Amendment, corporations had the same'
p435
aS'right as individuals to make unlimited, independent expenditures in federal elections'
p436
aS'because such spending does not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.'
p437
aS'The court based this new somewhat novel view that independent spending can never'
p438
aS'corrupt on two important predicates. The spending must be totally independent of'
p439
aS'candidates and political parties, and it must be fully disclosed so that in the words of'
p440
aS'Justice Kennedy and Citizens United, the public can see whether elected officials are in'
p441
aS'the pockets of so-called money interests.'
p442
aS'So are their spending totally independent of candidates? Do we have full disclosure?'
p443
aS'Jonathan Soros will tell us in a few minutes.'

S"Thanks. I feel a little bit under qualified for this debate because I think I'm the only"
p481
aS'panelist who has not created a super PAC. Although I briefly contemplated starting an'
p482
aS'anti-anti-super PAC super PAC. It seemed too complicated to me, but maybe Trevor'
p483
aS"could help me out. So I'm talking instead from the perspective of somebody who has"
p484
aS'been writing about civil liberties issues for about 25 years now. And I see this as'
p485
aS'fundamentally an issue of freedom of speech. Consider the legal situation before the'
p486
aS"Citizens United case. Wealthy individuals were free to speak without limit. Jonathan's"
p487
aS'father, for example, spent about $24 billion during the -- or excuse me, million dollars'
p488
aS'during the 2004 election season to defeat George W. Bush. And more power to him.'
p489
aS'Media corporations such as the ones that own FOX news and the New York Times were'
p490
aS'also free to speak without limit. Parties and candidates could spend as much as they'
p491
aS'wanted on political messages, although the contributions for them were limited. By'
p492
aS'contrast, unions, businesses and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the NRA or the'
p493
aS'ACLU, could not talk about their issues on the air close to an election if they happen to'
p494
aS'mention the name of a candidate for federal office. Furthermore, as David mentioned,'
p495
aS'people of lesser means could not get together and pool their resources to use for'
p496
aS'election-related messages unless they registered with the FEC and were subject to strict'
p497
aS'contribution limits. People often overlook what was actually at issue in the Citizens'
p498
aS'United case. This was a documentary that was produced by a conservative group,'
p499
aS'Citizens United. It was called "Hillary: The Movie." They wanted to air it during the'
p500
aS'2008 election season, and they were prohibited from doing so. Why? First of all, it'
p501
aS'mentioned a candidate for federal office. She was running for the Democratic'
p502
aS'presidential nomination at the time.'
p503
aS'And two, it made her look bad. Now, whatever you think about Hillary Clinton or about'
p504
aS'this particular movie about her, how can that possibly be consistent with a'
p505
aS'constitutional provision that says "congressional shall make no law abridging the'
p506
aS'freedom of speech"? The Supreme Court concluded that it could not. And it also'
p507
aS'concluded that the First Amendment made it -- forced it to override an earlier rule that'
p508
aS'said you cannot engage and express advocacy if you are a corporation or a union,'
p509
aS'meaning you explicitly were advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. You'
p510
aS'frequently hear a couple of arguments in response to this decision from people who'
p511
aS"didn't like it. First of all, they say, money is not speech. Well, that's literally true. But"
p512
aS'you do need money in order to get your message across to a mass audience. So I'
p513
aS"suppose Congress passed a law saying newspapers can exist, but they can't spend any"
p514
aS'money. Or newspapers can exist, but they can only spend up to this amount of money.'
p515
aS'Clearly, that would be abridging the freedom of the press. Similarly, if Congress said,'
p516
aS"you can spend as much as you want if you're a newspaper, but we're going to limit how"
p517
aS'much you can take in from advertisers and readers.'
p518
aS'So once you understand that this is really controlling -- money in effect is controlling'
p519
aS'speech, I think you also have to recognize that loosening these regulations on speech'
p520
aS'does not mean empowering people to buy elections. Why? Because the messages that'
p521
aS"you pay for still have to persuade voters. You're still talking about convincing people to"
p522
aS'vote a certain way. There are a number of striking illustrations from recent elections'
p523
aS"that show you that money can't buy you love. And I'll just give you a couple of them."
p524
aS'One from 2010, Linda McMahan is trying again this year. She spent $46 million of her'
p525
aS'own money on a Senate campaign in Connecticut. It was nearly a hundred dollars for'
p526
aS'every vote she received. She lost by 12 points. This year, Jeff Lake won the Republican'
p527
aS'nomination for the Senate in Arizona. Even though he was outspent two to one, he won'
p528
aS'by 48 points. So clearly, money is not the whole story.'
p529
aS"It is, nevertheless, true that in general, the people who win tend to spend more. But it's"
p530
aS'also true that stronger candidates tend to attract more money. Well, what makes a'
p531
aS'candidate strong? There are various characteristics that you can imagine that would'
p532
aS'make people both better able to raise money and better able to get votes, charisma,'
p533
aS'popular policy positions, but one of the most important is incumbency. And'
p534
aS'incumbency gives people tremendous advantages in terms of visibility, the power to'
p535
aS'dispense pork, name recognition, and the reelection rates for members of Congress are'
p536
aS'insanely high. I mean, historically, in the past few cycles, 90 percent or more even in the'
p537
aS'last -- in the 2010, when Democrats lost a bunch of seats, it was still about 85 percent.'
p538
aS'So incumbents have this huge advantage and they use campaign finance regulations to'
p539
aS'reinforce that advantage. One great example is the so-called Millionaires Amendment,'
p540
aS'which was part of McCain-Feingold Act. It said that if you face an opponent who is'
p541
aS"spending his own money, he's financing his own campaign, then we're going to lift the"
p542
aS'limits on the contributions you can get.'
p543
aS'So this is clearly designed to help out incumbents who are facing self financed'
p544
aS'challengers. Another argument you often hear is that corporations are not people.'
p545
aS"Well, that's also literally true, but corporations are created by people. I mean, they're"
p546
aS"not created by robots or dolphins or extraterrestrials. I mean, they're created to"
p547
aS'achieve certain goals. The question in Citizens United was whether people lose the right'
p548
aS'to freedom of speech when they organize themselves as corporations. I think people'
p549
aS'tend to think when you hear the word "corporation" of these huge businesses like Wal-'
p550
aS'Mart or Exxon Mobile, but, you know, every one of us works for a corporation. This'
p551
aS'debate tonight is sponsored by a corporation. The groups that are complaining that'
p552
aS'corporations have too much influence over politics are themselves corporations, right?'
p553
aS'So you have to understand that corporations overwhelmingly consist of small businesses'
p554
aS'and nonprofits, not these huge businesses. And they represent all sorts of points of'
p555
aS'view and take on all sorts of issues.'
p556
aS'Our moderator, by the way, works for a corporation, Walt Disney Company, correct?'

S"Thank you. I can see that we're going to have a lot to talk about tonight, but my"
p612
aS'partner, Trevor Potter, laid out the case for why in response to the First Amendment we'
p613
aS'still have an important interest in mitigating the corruption that can result from even'
p614
aS'independent political activity but from in particular from contributions to candidates.'
p615
aS'I\'m going to take us on a closer look at the proposition, itself, "Two cheers for super'
p616
aS'PACs," and suggest that we don\'t even have the rules that super PACs were premised'
p617
aS'on.'
p618
aS"Mr. Keating laid out a very rosy picture of what super PACs are, but that doesn't really"
p619
aS'resemble what they are in fact. After 40 years of Supreme Court intervention, what we'
p620
aS"have is more loophole than law. Let's start with the issue of independence. As my"
p621
aS'partner mentioned, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that speech that is'
p622
aS"independent of campaigns can't be corrupting, and, therefore, can't be restricted. Let's"
p623
aS'set aside for a moment how ridiculous that statement is, that if somebody showed up'
p624
aS'and said, "I\'m going to spend a billion dollars to support candidates who favor position X'
p625
aS'or position Y," that that\'s not going to have some influence on candidates or elected'
p626
aS'officials. We\'ll leave that aside for a moment and just look at what "independent" really'
p627
aS'means today because the rules around what independent is for super PACs are basically'
p628
aS'nonexistent. There are in effect only two rules that apply.'
p629
aS"One, candidates may not share inside information from what they're thinking and what"
p630
aS'their resources are with a super PAC, and the super PAC may not give a contribution'
p631
aS'directly to the campaign. Obviously, they can give lots of things of value indirectly, like'
p632
aS"spending lots of money on television. There are more rules about what Goldman Sachs'"
p633
aS'partners can say to each other than there are about what super PACs can say to'
p634
aS"candidates. We've all seen the jokes that this leads to. My partner's super PAC,"
p635
aS"Americans for a Better Tomorrow Tomorrow, has been referenced several times. It's"
p636
aS'one of the best pieces of political theater that has happened in the last 24 months. I'
p637
aS"would strongly suggest, if you haven't seen it, you go online and find it. It's really funny."
p638
aS"But what we're seeing in that -- and they've provided a tremendous example -- is that"
p639
aS"there are, in effect, no lines between super PACs and candidates. Let's just give a couple"
p640
aS'of examples. Candidates can raise money for super PACs. They can show up at their'
p641
aS'fundraisers, and they can raise money, at least up to the $5,000 federal limit.'
p642
aS'But then what happens after they leave? Who knows? We all know, at least in the'
p643
aS'presidential election, the super PACs are being run by long-term aides of the candidates,'
p644
aS'in both instances. Candidates can endorse super PACs. You hear Mitt Romney talking'
p645
aS'about "my" super PAC. And just in the last couple of weeks, since we\'ve watched the'
p646
aS'conventions, we heard about Karl Rove, who, of course, was senior advisor to President'
p647
aS'Bush and to many other Republicans, getting briefings about his super PAC around'
p648
aS'Tampa. And last week in Charlotte, Rahm Emmanuel, who had been, at one time, White'
p649
aS'House chief of staff, and was the honorary chairman of the Obama campaign, left that'
p650
aS'position and the next day was giving interviews on the floor of the convention about'
p651
aS'how he was now tapped to be the lead fundraiser for the Obama-aligned super PAC. So,'
p652
aS'clearly, independence under the current rule is a joke. That, in effect, leaving aside'
p653
aS"what's happened in the super PAC, has undermined something we thought we had"
p654
aS'before.'
p655
aS'We thought we had contribution limits, again, as my partner described, for very good'
p656
aS'reason, to avoid the issues of political corruption that come with large contributions to'
p657
aS'candidates. Now, those rules still technically exist. You can still only give $2,500 to a'
p658
aS'candidate. You can only give $25,000, or whatever the limit is, to a party. But you can'
p659
aS"then turn around and give $25 million to a super PAC that's working, essentially, as a"
p660
aS"surrogate for the campaign. Though, let's remember that those $2,500 and $25,000 are"
p661
aS"irrelevant to most of the population anyway. It's only 1 percent of 1 percent of the"
p662
aS"population that's giving north of $10,000 a year to those entities. Well, now, with super"
p663
aS"PACs, we've seen that shrink even further. So 200 people account for 80 percent of the"
p664
aS'money that was raised for Super PACs, at least as of the last filing.'
p665
aS"Lastly, let's talk about transparency. It's true; super PACs do have to disclose their"
p666
aS'donors and their expenditures.'
p667
aS'Transparency is something that the Supreme Court speaks glowingly of in Citizens'
p668
aS"United and other cases. But there's a loophole that you can drive a billion dollars"
p669
aS"through, right? You don't have to give your political money to a super PAC. You can"
p670
aS'give your political money to a so-called social welfare organization, or corporations can'
p671
aS'give them to industry groups, and those can do almost exactly the same thing as super'
p672
aS'PACs can do, and they don\'t have to disclose their donors. So when people say, "How'
p673
aS'much money is being spent in this election?" the answer is, "We actually don\'t really'
p674
aS'know." We know that it will be more than ever before, but we don\'t know exactly how'
p675
aS"much, and we don't know exactly where it's coming from."
p676
aS'These are problems that can be addressed. We can have rules on transparency that'
p677
aS"address disclosure of all political spending that's related to the election. We can have"
p678
aS'rules, coherent rules, around independence that require that super PACs are at least an'
p679
aS"arm's length distance from the campaigns."
p680
aS"We need a functioning enforcement agency, and I hope that we'll have a chance to talk"
p681
aS'a little bit about the dysfunction of the FCC later on. But none of this will make a'
p682
aS'difference without an alternative. A friend of mine likes to say that transparency alone'
p683
aS'is like the webcam that was at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico showing us the Deep'
p684
aS"Water Horizon well, right? Shows you everything that's spewing into the Gulf, but it"

p715
aS'this: "Two Cheers for Super PACs: Money in Politics is Still Overregulated." We have'
p716
aS'two teams of two arguing it out.'
p717
aS'David Keating and Jacob Sullum are arguing for Two Cheers. They say that in a world'
p718
aS"where political speech depends on money, you don't want to put limits on either of"
p719
aS'those things; that, in fact, super PACs and spending of money in politics has the effect of'

p722
aS'competition to be financed and elected either.'
p723
aS'On the other side, Trevor Potter and Jonathan Soros are making the argument against'
p724
aS"super PACs. They're saying that unlimited money puts people into office who are then"
p725
aS'beholden to the suppliers of the unlimited money. The larger the amount, the more'
p726
aS"beholden that they'll be, especially if the source of the money is secret. They say that"

S'So during the first round of arguments in Citizens United, Deputy Solicitor General'
p2226
aS'Malcolm Stewart was asked, "Well, if you can ban this movie, \'Hillary: the Movie,\' what'
p2227
aS'about if you have very similar material but it was presented in a different medium, like'
p2228
aS'DVDs or on the internet or even in books?"'
p2229
aS'And he said, "That would be constitutionally permissible too." This was pretty shocking,'
p2230
aS'because it raised the possibility that the government could ban books in the name of'
p2231
aS'fighting corruption. It was widely seen as the turning point in the case. They had a'
p2232
aS'second round of oral arguments, which was very unusual, prompted largely by this'
p2233
aS'revelation. And during that round, the solicitor general, Elena Kagan, said the'
p2234
aS'government had changed its answer. She said there would be a strong constitutional'
p2235
aS'case against punishing an organization for publishing a book, but that pamphlets were'
p2236
aS'different because they were classic electioneering. Well, that raised new questions.'
p2237
aS'When does a pamphlet become a book? Is it a matter of the number of pages? Is it the'
p2238
aS'kind of cover it has, the binding, or what? Now, the media exemption that I alluded to'
p2239
aS'before, upon close examination, looks equally arbitrary. Citizens United, after all, was'
p2240
aS'producing movies. So why was that, Citizens United, not a media corporation?'
p2241
aS'The NRA started a radio show, daily radio show, after McCain-Feingold was passed, and'
p2242
aS'they said, "Look, we\'re a media corporation; we\'re exempt." If that\'s legitimate, then'
p2243
aS"why couldn't every advocacy group do the same sort of thing? Does the internet count"
p2244
aS"as a medium? Presumably it does. Then doesn't every group that has a website qualify"
p2245
aS'as a media corporation? This media exemption puts the government in the position of'
p2246
aS'deciding who deserves to have unfettered freedom of speech and who does not, which'
p2247
aS'is precisely the sort of distinctions the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit. And'
p2248
aS"whether you're worried about corruption or you're worried about undue influence, the"
p2249
aS'arguments for regulation are just as strong, if not stronger, in the case of media'
p2250
aS'corporations. So while many of my fellow journalists have supported these kinds of'
p2251
aS"regulations, basically lobbying to keep their own special speech privileges, it's always"
p2252
aS'seemed foolish to me for people who make a living by talking about politics to appoint'
p2253
aS'the government as a sort of national debate moderator, because you never know when'
p2254
aS"the moderator will decide that it's time for you to shut up."

aS'In June, they gave $200,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore our Future. This is'

S"Well, since we passed the major campaign finance restrictions in the early 1970s, we've"
p2312
aS'seen competition decline dramatically. We used to see elections that were far more'
p2313
aS'competitive than they are today. The re-election rate has gone up not down. But'
p2314
aS'fundamentally I think what we have to keep in mind here is when -- who is going to'
p2315
aS'write these restrictions? Who is going to write the campaign finance laws and'
p2316
aS"regulations? Well, the answer is it's going to be the incumbent members of Congress."
p2317
aS'There is no other way to write them. And if there is ever a conflict of interest about'
p2318
aS"how this is going to be written, that's a conflict."
p2319
aS'They get to write the regulations so they probably will write them so that they will be'

p2321
aS"about our freedom of speech or our ability to criticize the job they're doing. In fact, they"
p2322
aS'would like to see less criticism of it. So basically, this is a debate about who decides'
p2323
aS'what you can say? Should it be us the people getting together and deciding, or should it'
p2324
aS'be the politicians? And should it be the prosecutors who are looking to make a name'
p2325
aS'for themselves? You have to keep in mind many of these laws that are written not only'
p2326
aS"have civil penalties but criminal penalties. And if you think that's far-fetched, the very"
p2327
aS'first political prosecution taken under these laws was a group that took out a full-page'
p2328
aS"ad urging Nixon's impeachment for the invasion of Cambodia."
p2329
aS'That was the first prosecution under the campaign finance laws. I would say free speech'
p2330
aS'is messy. But the cure of additional regulations written by politicians who want to stay'
