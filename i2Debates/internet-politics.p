p36
aS'posed our resolution to two of my dinner partners, Rupert Murdoch and George W.'
p37
aS'Bush.'
p38
aS'They both had strong views, and both were against the motion. Murdoch was'
p39
aS'vehement that FOX News is not polarizing, but presents --'
p40
aS'-- but presents a more balanced view than the other networks and attracts an audience'
p41
aS'that is 40 percent Democrat, which I thought was an interesting statistic. And President'
p42
aS'Bush argued that in most of the world, the internet has opened minds to the way of life'
p43
aS'in the liberal democracies and has been a hugely constructive force for change.'
p44
aS'He acknowledged the extreme polarization of American politics, but blamed it on the'
p45
aS'class warfare rhetoric of his successor. Whenever one thinks of their points, they do'
p46
aS'illuminate some of the subtleties in the language of our resolution. Murdoch correctly'
p47
aS'grasped that it does not posit that the internet is the sole or even the primary driver of'
p48
aS'the narrow ideologies that seem to dominate politics. Rather, he understood the'
p49
aS'internet as part of a broader trend toward a highly fragmented media. And President'
p50
aS'Bush, by taking the resolution in a global context, prompts me to clarify that what we'
p51
aS'expect to talk about tonight is American politics. Why might be the internet be closing'
p52
aS'our minds? The first reason is that the internet makes it very easy to tailor the'
p53
aS'information we get to conform to a preconceived world view.'
p54
aS'We can choose news aggregators on the left or on the right, not to mention highly'
p55
aS'ideological bloggers and live our lives without encountering any contrary opinion. In a'
p56
aS'great little essay called, "Why Groups Go to Extremes," Cass Sunstein, the Obama'
p57
aS"administration's regulatory czar, demonstrated empirically that discussing issues with"
p58
aS'like-minded folks tends to make positions more extreme. In addition to self selection,'
p59
aS'the internet makes it easy for websites to, "personalize our offerings." It seems'
p60
aS'innocuous, even helpful when Netflix tells us that the viewers who enjoyed movie A also'
p61
aS'enjoyed movie B. But if you Google federal deficit or Medicare reform, is it healthy for'
p62
aS'your search to come up differently than mine based on what Google has been able to'
p63
aS'infer about our political leanings?'
p64
aS'Those against the motion will argue that the internet is a vast information utility which'
p65
aS'facilitates search, learning and communications. Personalization may be a blessing,'
p66
aS'simply helping us make the choices we want to make. We can turn personal filters on or'
p67
aS"off, so there's no real danger here. And little hard evidence that Google has helped us"
p68
aS'erect mental fortresses through which contrary ideas are not allowed to penetrate.'
p69
aS'Indeed, the filters from the pre-internet era, three like-minded networks and a handful'
p70
aS'of local newspapers, were arguably less hospitable to views outside American census'
p71
aS'than the open marketplace and information and ideas we have today. To illuminate the'
p72
aS"complexities here, we have four distinguished experts, and it's now my privilege to turn"
p73
aS'the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan.'

S'Good evening, everyone. I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds'
p245
aS"with a bit of regret. This isn't the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few"
p246
aS"years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I've come to believe that the --"
p247
aS'well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get'
p248
aS'together, think together, work together.'
p249
aS"But it's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the"
p250
aS'view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is'
p251
aS"kind of a dated view, that the Internet's changing, and that there are a few big"
p252
aS'companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of'
p253
aS'open place. So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable'
p254
aS'commodity out there right now. If you command attention, then you can direct it'
p255
aS"towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that's why all of the"
p256
aS'big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for'
p257
aS'gathering as much of it as possible. And most of them are focused on the same strategy'
p258
aS'which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us'
p259
aS'what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms,'
p260
aS"we're going to be interested in."
p261
aS'Relevance is the big watchword here. So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if'
p262
aS"you look at what they're saying, it's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan."
p263
aS'Eric Schmidt says, "Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not'
p264
aS'in some way been tailored to you." Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, "Within the next'
p265
aS"few years, it'll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn't been customized to your"
p266
aS'personal interests in some way." And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how'
p267
aS'people get their news and how people get their information. So why are they doing'
p268
aS'this? Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well. Why does Facebook employ filters?'
p269
aS'The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues. And'
p270
aS"the thing is that these companies aren't blind to the psychology of all this. They've read"
p271
aS'all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that'
p272
aS'confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of'
p273
aS"pleasure happening in people's brains."
p274
aS'And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they'
p275
aS"believed, they get cranky. That's just the way we're wired. And so if you're a company"
p276
aS"that's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people"
p277
aS"with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn't you? As a result of this kind"
p278
aS"of personalization and self selection, we're more likely to see things we agree with and"
p279
aS"less likely to see things we disagree with. Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that all"
p280
aS"personalization is bad. Personalization certainly can have benefits. I'm a Netflix user."
p281
aS'But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that'
p282
aS"most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization? And I'll argue that"
p283
aS"because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they're building are going"
p284
aS"to tend to surround us with information that's agreeable to us and not with information"
p285
aS"that's uncomfortable."
p286
aS'So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling'
p287
aS'Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling'
p288
aS'Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring. This actually'
p289
aS"happened, I've got the screenshots on my website. And, you know, I could run through"
p290
aS"a number of other anecdotes, but actually there's been a study -- the only peer"
p291
aS"reviewed study I'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of"
p292
aS'personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front'
p293
aS"page are usually personalized. Either they're in a different order or they're actually, you"
p294
aS'know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks'
p295
aS"you'll be interested in. So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the"
p296
aS'Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do. And'
p297
aS"in particular we have to tease apart what's possible to access versus what people do"
p298
aS"access. For example, now that the -- it's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde"
p299
aS'or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times.'
p300
aS'So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy,'
p301
aS'information, of whats going on in other countries, that people would know more about'
p302
aS'whats going on there. In fact thats not true. According to a Pew study from 2007,'
p303
aS'people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than'
p304
aS'in 2007. So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, its kind of beside the'
p305
aS'point. Whats relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is'
p306
aS'whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more'
p307
aS'particular, different ideological ones. I agree here again with Evgeny who says the'
p308
aS'regular folk dont read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting'
p309
aS'blog posts from all over the world. Instead they are more likely to use the internet to'
p310
aS'rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry. So to'
p311
aS'summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web.'
p312
aS"They want to show you what they think youre going to be interested in. And this isn't"
p313
aS'passive. This isnt me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of'
p314
aS'the Nation. This is embedded in an increasing number of websites. Yahoo News in 2007,'
p315
aS'was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same. But now, Yahoo runs 13'
p316
aS'million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day. And theyre different'
p317
aS'for each person. Its hard to even see. We dont know how tailored our view of the web'
p318
aS'is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences. So'
p319
aS'the object of this personalization is to get us to click more. Its to get us to like more.'
p320
aS'And importantly, its to get us to click on ads. And theres little benefit in that world to'
p321
aS'presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views,'
p322
aS'or that makes us think differently. I dont think that this has caused the extreme'
p323
aS'political polarization that were seeing right now. But I think it cant help but exacerbate'
p324
aS'it.'
p325
aS'Google says that its trying to provide relevance. But what is the most relevant search'
p326
aS'result when youre a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11? Is it the conspiracy links'
p327
aS'that Googles algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article'
p328
aS'that would debunk that stuff? I asked Google this question and they didnt really have a'
p329
aS'clear answer. So its with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential.'
p330
aS'The way that most people actually use the thing isnt to broaden their political'
p331
aS'perspectives. In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our'
p332
aS'political views. Thank you.'

S'Thank you John. Eli, you cant have Evgeny. Hes committed to me till at least 8:15.'
p359
aS'Look, Ill concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting'
p360
aS'theoretical problem. People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already'
p361
aS'agree with. And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic'
p362
aS'bubble, where they mostly interact with people who have similar views. But is that a'
p363
aS'phenomenon thats getting worse? And if it is getting worse, is it getting worse because'
p364
aS'of the internet? Eli, and I think Siva, is going to argue that because, they think that'
p365
aS'because Google and Facebook are bad for us, it must be. But their skepticism about'
p366
aS'these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who'
p367
aS'think that new technology only brings us good things. There are a lot of interesting'
p368
aS'theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug, that are just'
p369
aS'never born out in practice.'
p370
aS'The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right? Is Google making you'
p371
aS'stupid? Is Facebook making you lonely? Thats actually the cover this month. Is Twitter'
p372
aS'destroying your attention span? But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at'
p373
aS'questions like this in a more empirical way. So whats the evidence for tonights'
p374
aS'proposition, the internet is narrowing our views. I wont say theres none, but I will say'
p375
aS'its laughably weak. And theres some really good evidence that the webs doing the'
p376
aS'opposite of what our opponents claim, that its exposing us to a broader range of'
p377
aS'perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook. And its on that empirical'
p378
aS'basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow, that you'
p379
aS'should vote against tonights motion. Theres of course some studies about this. There'
p380
aS'was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers dont just talk to their'
p381
aS'own side.'
p382
aS'They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and its not all the kind of'
p383
aS"exchange John cited at the beginning. There's a Pew study from last year that show --"
p384
aS'this is a quote, "No evidence that social network users, including those who use'
p385
aS'Facebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded'
p386
aS'and similar people as some have feared." There\'s another new Pew study that says that'
p387
aS"people's social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries. The biggest study"
p388
aS'which involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but it'
p389
aS'was a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people they'
p390
aS"aren't close to. That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news. So Eli said"
p391
aS'at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that "Google'
p392
aS'was tailoring search results to our politics." He said that on the basis of one anecdote'
p393
aS"from a friend I don't think he named. He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt."
p394
aS'Allow me to be skeptical.'
p395
aS'You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the'
p396
aS'day for a variety of reasons. But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine,'
p397
aS'different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search some'
p398
aS'parallel, very political loaded terms like "climate change." And basically, they got'
p399
aS"exactly the same thing. And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to support"
p400
aS"what Eli is talking about. I've looked at the studies. Now, since Eli wrote his book,"
p401
aS'Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and search'
p402
aS"returns. So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only people"
p403
aS"in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideological"
p404
aS'bias in the returns. But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically'
p405
aS"addresses Eli's problem. He had a lot of influence on this. You can turn customization"
p406
aS'off by pressing the prominent button that says, "Hide personal results." And you can'
p407
aS"toggle back and forth if you're curious about the difference."
p408
aS"On Facebook, it's just as easy to turn off customization. You change the sort option on"
p409
aS'your top stories to most recent. In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites,'
p410
aS'is completely transparent and optional. I leave customization on most of the time'
p411
aS"because a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble. And take music just"
p412
aS'as an example I think we can all relate to. The reason I use Spotify, which is a social'
p413
aS"music service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to be"
p414
aS"exposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends. So back at the"
p415
aS'level of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political'
p416
aS"perspective? I think it's much harder to do that than it seems. News organizations are"
p417
aS"really trying to do that. They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, when"
p418
aS'you go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page. Of course, you can'
p419
aS"get narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that."
p420
aS'You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV. Now, it is worth'
p421
aS"noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about."
p422
aS"And that was the mainstream media before the internet. When I was a kid in the '70s,"
p423
aS'you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, local'
p424
aS"newspapers. There weren't any national ones. And it was a very limited range of"
p425
aS'viewpoints and voices. And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you have'
p426
aS'to do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers. So'
p427
aS'personally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter. I use it as a'
p428
aS'filter for stories that are relevant to me. And what it does is the opposite of narrowing'
p429
aS"my perspective. Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources as"
p430
aS'well as American ones. I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab'
p431
aS'Spring. I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei'
p432
aS"the Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the world"
p433
aS'today.'
p434
aS'And those filters broaden my perspective. Twitter is a serendipity engine. Finally, I'
p435
aS"don't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up"
p436
aS"your mind about tonight's motion. All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple"
p437
aS'question: Has the web narrowed my mind? Has it made me less tolerant of people I'
p438
aS'disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say? Or has it exposed me'
p439
aS'to a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied'
p440
aS"on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information? Unless you're"
p441
aS"convinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion."

p475
aS"So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I didn't hear a word Jacob said."
p476
aS'So in these brief comments, I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked'
p477
aS"in the resolution and what we mean by politics. And I'm going to convince you to"
p478
aS'support the resolution. First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of'
p479
aS'Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity. In 1999,'
p480
aS'Thomas Friedman wrote these words: "the internet is going to be like a huge vise. It\'s'
p481
aS'going to keep tightening and tightening that system --meaning the system of'
p482
aS'globalization -- "around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller'
p483
aS'and faster and faster."'
p484
aS"Well, Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong. He's been exactly that wrong"
p485
aS'many times, but never more wrong.'
p486
aS'Now, in 2012, it\'s clear that there is no such thing as "The Internet, capital T, capital I as'
p487
aS'Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s. There is no equalizing force, great'
p488
aS'democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives'
p489
aS'us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that'
p490
aS'matter. In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized,'
p491
aS"compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized. It's far from"
p492
aS"global, and it's getting less so every day. The online experience of a person sitting in"
p493
aS'Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so'
p494
aS'different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in'
p495
aS'China.'
p496
aS'And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in'
p497
aS"Russia or the United States. And we're talking about more than censorship, although, in"
p498
aS"many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue. We're also"
p499
aS'talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments'
p500
aS'will let people use. The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as'
p501
aS'well. Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication'
p502
aS"in an instant, we've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we've"
p503
aS'seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States. Internet'
p504
aS'technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want. And'
p505
aS"the fact is, we're pretty provincial animals. So add the internet to it, we just double"
p506
aS'down.'
p507
aS'We get more provincial. Platforms matter, defaults matter, and policies matter. So'
p508
aS'here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook'
p509
aS'friends across the globe singing, "We are the world." There is no coordinated global'
p510
aS"movement for justice. There's no sophisticated online debate about our collective"
p511
aS'human state or even our basic human needs. The dominant powers governing our'
p512
aS'digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the'
p513
aS'United States are not interested in such matters. They are not interested in us being'
p514
aS'political. Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China. More often than'
p515
aS'not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like'
p516
aS"shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows. Not that there's anything wrong with"
p517
aS"clicking on virtual cows, but it ain't political."
p518
aS'Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated'
p519
aS'into niches and nations. But all hope is not lost. There is nothing about the nature of'
p520
aS'the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political. Many of us actually'
p521
aS'are, I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of'
p522
aS"avoiding these traps. We're pretty elite. We're pretty aware. And we're pretty"
p523
aS"connected. And we route around a lot of these problems. We're also hungry for"
p524
aS"information. If you weren't hungry, you wouldn't be here. So many of us, despite what"
p525
aS'Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have'
p526
aS'managed to be richly political. But we do know that the internet by itself does not'
p527
aS"topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers. It's just not that simple. If we"
p528
aS'recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can'
p529
aS'correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive.'
p530
aS'We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend'
p531
aS"cosmopolitan perspectives. We just haven't done that yet. We've been really busy"
p532
aS'clicking on cows. But all that takes work. It takes real human work in addition to'
p533
aS'invention and imagination, real human effort. But the first step to recognizing that --'
p534
aS"I'm sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what's happening. When it"
p535
aS'comes to politics, the Internet, most importantly how we experience the Internet is'
p536
aS'closing our minds one cow click at a time. Please vote for the motion. Thanks.'

p567
aS"Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with"
p568
aS"us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history. First, technology always plays"
p569
aS'the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind.'
p570
aS'Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," in'
p571
aS"the '80s? Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the"
p572
aS'American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones. And he actually argued'
p573
aS'that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents. We know what the late Allan'
p574
aS'Bloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried by'
p575
aS'the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me.'
p576
aS'The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as'
p577
aS'the . As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew'
p578
aS'Shapiro, which argued, and I quote, "Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia'
p579
aS'than cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and with'
p580
aS'information tailored to your desires." That was 1995. Six years later, Cass Sunstein'
p581
aS'argued that, "The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because'
p582
aS'likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views,"'
p583
aS'end of quote. So enter Eli Pariser. In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiro'
p584
aS'and Sunstein. All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is'
p585
aS"taking place. But they're also different."
p586
aS'Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way out'
p587
aS'and simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters and'
p588
aS"algorithms are doing this for us. It's a very important difference. Shapiro and Sunstein"
p589
aS'blame the filter bubble on us, the users. But Pariser blames it on the companies. Now,'
p590
aS"who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory? After all, it's always good to find"
p591
aS'someone else to blame but us. I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that'
p592
aS'Jacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters'
p593
aS"naturally enhance our political culture. So let's take Twitter. Many people think that"
p594
aS'Twitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering. That'
p595
aS'is actually not true. Twitter does hide certain types of messages. Thus, if you follow me'
p596
aS"but you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet."
p597
aS'Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my'
p598
aS"messages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva."
p599
aS'And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf. Is it paternalistic?'
p600
aS'Sure. Are these types of paternalism justified? Well, take my case. I follow more than'
p601
aS"2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get. But if I have"
p602
aS'to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of'
p603
aS"people that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000"
p604
aS"people. At best, I would follow 100. This is the beauty of it, Twitter's "
p605
aS"filter allows me to access more, not less useful information. Now, let's take Facebook."
p606
aS'It has 800 million users. Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends and'
p607
aS'spend hours on it every day. Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen'
p608
aS'friends. So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation. If you are a heavy'
p609
aS'user, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order.'
p610
aS'Thats the most recent updates from all your friends come first. However, if you only'
p611
aS'use it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates. The'
p612
aS'assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30'
p613
aS'minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order? To'
p614
aS'Facebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption. Thats why relevance'
p615
aS'rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users. If you want to see all'
p616
aS'the recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called most'
p617
aS'recent. Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is'
p618
aS'good or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, we'
p619
aS'should also accept that filters make it better. Now lets tackle the elephant in the room,'
p620
aS'which is Google. Suppose Im so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is'
p621
aS'larger than Glenn Becks.'
p622
aS'So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job. I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim,'
p623
aS'that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that the'
p624
aS'government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on. In other words, Im exactly'
p625
aS'the kind of guy that Eli is worried about. Furthermore, suppose that I became all of that'
p626
aS'before the filter bubble set in. In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to'
p627
aS'call the era of cable television. So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts'
p628
aS'personalizing my search results. Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11,'
p629
aS'actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends.'
p630
aS'In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well.'
p631
aS'Now this is the new mutual exposure, why is it a good thing? Well if you think that all'
p632
aS'my friends are nut cases like me, then we do have a problem, because '
p633
aS'exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid.'
p634
aS'But lets leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment. I dont think'
p635
aS'theyre representative of most internet users and their friends. The way Google and'
p636
aS'Facebook map out our social connections, they try to be very comprehensive. We see'
p637
aS'links from people we went to school with, our colleagues, our relatives, and so forth.'
p638
aS'Its quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11,'
p639
aS'climate change, Obamas birthplace, and UFOs. So my point is this, that a link to the'
p640
aS'report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, is'
p641
aS'more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social'
p642
aS'filter. In other words, its a possibility that people would now be paying more attention'
p643
aS'or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial,'
p644
aS'only because their friends are known to endorse those positions.'
p645
aS'So, to conclude, there are many good concerns about the future of the Internet. That'
p646
aS'of privacy ranks very high on my personal list, but the filter bubble is not one of them.'
p647
aS'Its okay to hate Google and Facebook, but we should hate them for the right reasons.'
p648
aS'Thank you.'

aS'And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US debate, where the motion'
p666
aS'being argued is, "When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." Keep in'
p667
aS'mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because were going to ask you to'
p668
aS'vote again at the end and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be'
p669
aS'declared our winner. Now we go on to round two. Round two is where the debaters'
p670
aS'address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and'
p671
aS'from me. We have two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, "When it'
p672
aS'comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds." The side arguing for the motion, Eli'
p673
aS'Pariser and Siva Vaidhyanathan. Theyre arguing that the internet is actually several'
p674
aS'internets, that they put up walls between the lands that are occupied by people of'
p675
aS'differing opinions, between nations as much as between liberals and conservatives.'
p676
aS'And that especially with customization, designed to give us what we want, that the'
p677
aS'internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded. The team'
p678
aS'arguing against the motion, Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov, theyre saying sure,'
p679
aS'maybe these bad things could happen someday but theres not much evidence that they'
p680
aS'are happening a lot yet right now. And besides a tool that can and does connect'
p681
aS'strangers globally around the world by definition, almost, is a good thing. And that'
p682
aS'customization, perhaps helps to organize the way that we think. So I want to put a'
p683
aS'question to the side that is arguing against the motion, that when it comes to politics,'
p684
aS'the internet is closing our minds. Jacob Weisberg, you said as your sort of slam dunk'
p685
aS'point to the audience, you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing'
p686
aS'your mind.'
p687
aS'But if the other guys are right, they wont know whether the audience is closing their'
p688
aS'minds because if their minds are being closed, part of having their minds closed is not'
p689
aS"knowing that their minds are being closed. I mean, but they're saying that it's an"
p690
aS"insidious thing, that it's a stealth thing, particularly with the customization, that it"
p691
aS'happens in a way that it comes to you -- you go through this process unawares. Can you'

p775
aS'funded by the companies themselves.'
p776
aS'The one clear study on Google personalization that has been peer reviewed is a study by'
p777
aS"a guy named Martin Feuz. And it's pretty clear. The methodology is good. He looked at"
p778
aS"how a search history affects the personalization you get. And it's very clear, again, 60"
p779
aS'percent of the search results on the first page are different for most -- for people who'
p780
aS"have a long web history in Google. But actually, the study that's the most interesting"
p781
aS'here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to. This is a study that was sort of'
p782
aS'initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that'
p783
aS"the internet isn't as polarizing as we thought. And the interesting thing is that if you dig"
p784
aS'into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite. What they did was they'
p785
aS'created an isolation index for each different kind of medium. And so the isolation index'
p786
aS'for cable news that that study used was about 3.3. On the internet, the internet had a 7'
p787
aS'-- an isolation index of 7.'
p788
aS"And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news. Now, what's more interesting"
p789
aS'is that this was -- the study was done before the personalized internet. So the main'
p790
aS'thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving'
p791
aS'patterns lead them to Yahoo! and then from Yahoo! out to a whole bunch of'
p792
aS"ideologically diverse links. But Yahoo!'s changed since 2007, since that study was"

S'So I want to read you a quote from two Stanford researchers from 1997. They said, "We'
p2430
aS'expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the'
p2431
aS'advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. We believe that the issue of'
p2432
aS'advertising causes enough mixed incentives that its crucial to have a competitive search'
p2433
aS'engine that is transparent and in the academic realm."'
p2434
aS'Now, the two researchers were Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and this was just months'
p2435
aS'before they launched Google as a for-profit entity. I think that version of them was'
p2436
aS'right. I think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put'
p2437
aS'information online have mixed motives. And the motives that they use in creating these'
p2438
aS'filters may not be, and in fact arent in our best interests. Theyre more likely to'
p2439
aS'surround us with voices that tell us that were great and were right and were good'
p2440
aS'enough and strong enough. And theyre less likely to confront us with the places where'
p2441
aS'were wrong. Whats been interesting for me since writing the book is that Ive actually'
p2442
aS'been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies, Amazon, Apple,'
p2443
aS'Google, YouTube, and Facebook. Ive had conversations with people in each of those'
p2444
aS'places. And its sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isnt a big part'
p2445
aS'of what these companies are trying to do. The engineers know that it is.'
p2446
aS'They wrestle with it every day. They wrestle with the mixed motives, with these'
p2447
aS'questions of how they should be building these platforms. And they know as one Netflix'
p2448
aS'vice president told me, that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles'
p2449
aS'where they tend to believe the same thing. So if you believe that the companies whose'
p2450
aS'algorithms decide what we pay attention to, will tend to expose us to a broad diverse'
p2451
aS'set of sources, you should vote with them. But if you agree with me that we should'
p2452
aS'scrutinize that, and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to'
p2453
aS'placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view, then you'
