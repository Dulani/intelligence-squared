aS"Well, I don't mean to be a name dropper, but last week I posed our resolution to two of my dinner partners, Rupert Murdoch and George W. Bush."
p37
aS'They both had strong views, and both were against the motion.'
p38
aS'Murdoch was vehement that FOX News is not polarizing, but presents -- -- but presents a more balanced view than the other networks and attracts an audience that is 40 percent Democrat, which I thought was an interesting statistic.'
p39
aS'And President Bush argued that in most of the world, the internet has opened minds to the way of life in the liberal democracies and has been a hugely constructive force for change.'
p40
aS'He acknowledged the extreme polarization of American politics, but blamed it on the class warfare rhetoric of his successor.'
p41
aS'Whenever one thinks of their points, they do illuminate some of the subtleties in the language of our resolution.'
p42
aS'Murdoch correctly grasped that it does not posit that the internet is the sole or even the primary driver of the narrow ideologies that seem to dominate politics.'
p43
aS'Rather, he understood the internet as part of a broader trend toward a highly fragmented media.'
p44
aS'And President Bush, by taking the resolution in a global context, prompts me to clarify that what we expect to talk about tonight is American politics.'
p45
aS'Why might be the internet be closing our minds?'
p46
aS'The first reason is that the internet makes it very easy to tailor the information we get to conform to a preconceived world view.'
p47
aS'We can choose news aggregators on the left or on the right, not to mention highly ideological bloggers and live our lives without encountering any contrary opinion.'
p48
aS'In a great little essay called, "Why Groups Go to Extremes," Cass Sunstein, the Obama administration\'s regulatory czar, demonstrated empirically that discussing issues with like-minded folks tends to make positions more extreme.'
p49
aS'In addition to self selection, the internet makes it easy for websites to, "personalize our offerings.'
p50
aS'" It seems innocuous, even helpful when Netflix tells us that the viewers who enjoyed movie A also enjoyed movie B.'
p51
aS'But if you Google federal deficit or Medicare reform, is it healthy for your search to come up differently than mine based on what Google has been able to infer about our political leanings?'
p52
aS'Those against the motion will argue that the internet is a vast information utility which facilitates search, learning and communications.'
p53
aS'Personalization may be a blessing, simply helping us make the choices we want to make.'
p54
aS"We can turn personal filters on or off, so there's no real danger here."
p55
aS'And little hard evidence that Google has helped us erect mental fortresses through which contrary ideas are not allowed to penetrate.'
p56
aS'Indeed, the filters from the pre-internet era, three like-minded networks and a handful of local newspapers, were arguably less hospitable to views outside American census than the open marketplace and information and ideas we have today.'

S'Good evening, everyone.'
p329
aS'I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds with a bit of regret.'
p330
aS"This isn't the place that I would want to be, and actually as of a few years ago I would have been arguing the other side, but I've come to believe that the -- well, the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get together, think together, work together."
p331
aS"But it's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people, and that the view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is kind of a dated view, that the Internet's changing, and that there are a few big companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of open place."
p332
aS'So the core of my argument is this, attention is the most valuable commodity out there right now.'
p333
aS"If you command attention, then you can direct it towards products or services and you can make a lot of money, and that's why all of the big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for gathering as much of it as possible."
p334
aS"And most of them are focused on the same strategy which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us what they think, what they predict, based on their -- this data and their algorithms, we're going to be interested in."
p335
aS'Relevance is the big watchword here.'
p336
aS"So, you know, if you talk to these companies, if you look at what they're saying, it's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan."
p337
aS'Eric Schmidt says, "Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not in some way been tailored to you.'
p338
aS'" Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, says, "Within the next few years, it\'ll be anachronistic to visit a website that hasn\'t been customized to your personal interests in some way.'
p339
aS'" And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how people get their news and how people get their information.'
p340
aS'So why are they doing this?'
p341
aS'Well, I think Evgeny actually put it really well.'
p342
aS'Why does Facebook employ filters?'
p343
aS'The more they know about us, the more they can make in advertising revenues.'
p344
aS"And the thing is that these companies aren't blind to the psychology of all this."
p345
aS"They've read all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that confirms what they already believed was true, you can actually see these little bursts of pleasure happening in people's brains."
p346
aS'And conversely, when people are presented with information that challenges what they believed, they get cranky.'
p347
aS"That's just the way we're wired."
p348
aS"And so if you're a company that's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people with information that tends to validate them, why wouldn't you?"
p349
aS"As a result of this kind of personalization and self selection, we're more likely to see things we agree with and less likely to see things we disagree with."
p350
aS"Now, to be clear, I'm not arguing that all personalization is bad."
p351
aS'Personalization certainly can have benefits.'
p352
aS"I'm a Netflix user."
p353
aS'But the question is, what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that most people use, and what are the effects of that personalization?'
p354
aS"And I'll argue that because of the motives of these companies, those filters that they're building are going to tend to surround us with information that's agreeable to us and not with information that's uncomfortable."
p355
aS'So a few examples of what this looks like in practice, it looks like one person googling Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring.'
p356
aS"This actually happened, I've got the screenshots on my website."
p357
aS"And, you know, I could run through a number of other anecdotes, but actually there's been a study -- the only peer reviewed study I'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front page are usually personalized."
p358
aS"Either they're in a different order or they're actually, you know, totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks you'll be interested in."
p359
aS'So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do.'
p360
aS"And in particular we have to tease apart what's possible to access versus what people do access."
p361
aS"For example, now that the -- it's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde or Die Zeit, as it is, in fact to access the New York Times."
p362
aS'So you would think, given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy, information, of whats going on in other countries, that people would know more about whats going on there.'
p363
aS'In fact thats not true.'
p364
aS'According to a Pew study from 2007, people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than in 2007.'
p365
aS'So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever, its kind of beside the point.'
p366
aS'Whats relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently, is whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more particular, different ideological ones.'
p367
aS'I agree here again with Evgeny who says the regular folk dont read sites like Global Voices, an aggregator of the most interesting blog posts from all over the world.'
p368
aS'Instead they are more likely to use the internet to rediscover their own culture and dare we say it, their own national bigotry.'
p369
aS'So to summarize, big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web.'
p370
aS'They want to show you what they think youre going to be interested in.'
p371
aS"And this isn't passive."
p372
aS'This isnt me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of the Nation.'
p373
aS'This is embedded in an increasing number of websites.'
p374
aS'Yahoo News in 2007, was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same.'
p375
aS'But now, Yahoo runs 13 million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day.'
p376
aS'And theyre different for each person.'
p377
aS'Its hard to even see.'
p378
aS'We dont know how tailored our view of the web is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences.'
p379
aS'So the object of this personalization is to get us to click more.'
p380
aS'Its to get us to like more.'
p381
aS'And importantly, its to get us to click on ads.'
p382
aS'And theres little benefit in that world to presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable, that challenges our views, or that makes us think differently.'
p383
aS'I dont think that this has caused the extreme political polarization that were seeing right now.'
p384
aS'But I think it cant help but exacerbate it.'
p385
aS'Google says that its trying to provide relevance.'
p386
aS'But what is the most relevant search result when youre a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11?'
p387
aS'Is it the conspiracy links that Googles algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article that would debunk that stuff?'
p388
aS'I asked Google this question and they didnt really have a clear answer.'
p389
aS'So its with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential.'
p390
aS'The way that most people actually use the thing isnt to broaden their political perspectives.'
p391
aS'In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our political views.'
p392
aS'Thank you.'

aS'Eli, you cant have Evgeny.'
p482
aS'Hes committed to me till at least 8:15.'
p483
aS'Look, Ill concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting theoretical problem.'
p484
aS'People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already agree with.'
p485
aS'And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic bubble, where they mostly interact with people who have similar views.'
p486
aS'But is that a phenomenon thats getting worse?'
p487
aS'And if it is getting worse, is it getting worse because of the internet?'
p488
aS'Eli, and I think Siva, is going to argue that because, they think that because Google and Facebook are bad for us, it must be.'
p489
aS'But their skepticism about these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who think that new technology only brings us good things.'
p490
aS'There are a lot of interesting theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug, that are just never born out in practice.'
p491
aS'The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right?'
p492
aS'Is Google making you stupid?'
p493
aS'Is Facebook making you lonely?'
p494
aS'Thats actually the cover this month.'
p495
aS'Is Twitter destroying your attention span?'
p496
aS'But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at questions like this in a more empirical way.'
p497
aS'So whats the evidence for tonights proposition, the internet is narrowing our views.'
p498
aS'I wont say theres none, but I will say its laughably weak.'
p499
aS'And theres some really good evidence that the webs doing the opposite of what our opponents claim, that its exposing us to a broader range of perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook.'
p500
aS'And its on that empirical basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow, that you should vote against tonights motion.'
p501
aS'Theres of course some studies about this.'
p502
aS'There was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers dont just talk to their own side.'
p503
aS'They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and its not all the kind of exchange John cited at the beginning.'
p504
aS'There\'s a Pew study from last year that show -- this is a quote, "No evidence that social network users, including those who use Facebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded and similar people as some have feared.'
p505
aS'" There\'s another new Pew study that says that people\'s social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries.'
p506
aS"The biggest study which involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but it was a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people they aren't close to."
p507
aS'That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news.'
p508
aS'So Eli said at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that "Google was tailoring search results to our politics.'
p509
aS'" He said that on the basis of one anecdote from a friend I don\'t think he named.'
p510
aS'He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt.'
p511
aS'Allow me to be skeptical.'
p512
aS'You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the day for a variety of reasons.'
p513
aS'But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine, different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search some parallel, very political loaded terms like "climate change.'
p514
aS'" And basically, they got exactly the same thing.'
p515
aS"And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to support what Eli is talking about."
p516
aS"I've looked at the studies."
p517
aS'Now, since Eli wrote his book, Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and search returns.'
p518
aS"So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only people in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideological bias in the returns."
p519
aS"But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically addresses Eli's problem."
p520
aS'He had a lot of influence on this.'
p521
aS'You can turn customization off by pressing the prominent button that says, "Hide personal results.'
p522
aS'" And you can toggle back and forth if you\'re curious about the difference.'
p523
aS"On Facebook, it's just as easy to turn off customization."
p524
aS'You change the sort option on your top stories to most recent.'
p525
aS'In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites, is completely transparent and optional.'
p526
aS"I leave customization on most of the time because a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble."
p527
aS'And take music just as an example I think we can all relate to.'
p528
aS"The reason I use Spotify, which is a social music service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to be exposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends."
p529
aS'So back at the level of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political perspective?'
p530
aS"I think it's much harder to do that than it seems."
p531
aS'News organizations are really trying to do that.'
p532
aS"They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, when you go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page."
p533
aS"Of course, you can get narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that."
p534
aS'You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV.'
p535
aS"Now, it is worth noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about."
p536
aS'And that was the mainstream media before the internet.'
p537
aS"When I was a kid in the '70s, you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, local newspapers."
p538
aS"There weren't any national ones."
p539
aS'And it was a very limited range of viewpoints and voices.'
p540
aS'And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you have to do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers.'
p541
aS'So personally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter.'
p542
aS'I use it as a filter for stories that are relevant to me.'
p543
aS'And what it does is the opposite of narrowing my perspective.'
p544
aS"Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources as well as American ones."
p545
aS'I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab Spring.'
p546
aS"I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei the Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the world today."
p547
aS'And those filters broaden my perspective.'
p548
aS'Twitter is a serendipity engine.'
p549
aS"Finally, I don't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up your mind about tonight's motion."
p550
aS'All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple question: Has the web narrowed my mind?'
p551
aS'Has it made me less tolerant of people I disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say?'
p552
aS'Or has it exposed me to a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information?'
p553
aS"Unless you're convinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion."

aS'Theres of course some studies about this.'
p582
aS'Therewas one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers dont just talk to theirown side.They respond to each other and link to each other a lot, and its not all the kind ofexchange John cited at the beginning.'
p583
aS'There\'s a Pew study from last year that show --this is a quote, "No evidence that social network users, including those who useFacebook, were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like mindedand similar people as some have feared.'
p584
aS'" There\'s another new Pew study that says thatpeople\'s social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries.'
p585
aS"The biggest studywhich involved 250 million Facebook users, yes, it was sponsored by Facebook, but itwas a good study, showed convincingly that most people share links from people theyaren't close to."
p586
aS'That is, we do reach outside of our personal circles for news.'
p587
aS'So Eli saidat the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year, that "Googlewas tailoring search results to our politics.'
p588
aS'" He said that on the basis of one anecdotefrom a friend I don\'t think he named.'
p589
aS'He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt.Allow me to be skeptical.You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of theday for a variety of reasons.'
p590
aS'But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine,different parts of the country, different political views, different worlds, to search someparallel, very political loaded terms like "climate change.'
p591
aS'" And basically, they gotexactly the same thing.'
p592
aS"And I don't think that there is more than anecdotes to supportwhat Eli is talking about."
p593
aS"I've looked at the studies."
p594
aS'Now, since Eli wrote his book,Google has changed, and it now includes results from your social network and searchreturns.'
p595
aS"So if you're spending all your time on Google Plus, and you're the only peoplein your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you may in fact see some ideologicalbias in the returns."
p596
aS"But Google added social searching in a way that actually specificallyaddresses Eli's problem."
p597
aS'He had a lot of influence on this.'
p598
aS'You can turn customizationoff by pressing the prominent button that says, "Hide personal results.'
p599
aS'" And you cantoggle back and forth if you\'re curious about the difference.On Facebook, it\'s just as easy to turn off customization.'
p600
aS'You change the sort option onyour top stories to most recent.'
p601
aS'In other words, the filtering they do, these giant sites,is completely transparent and optional.'
p602
aS"I leave customization on most of the timebecause a social filter doesn't actually trap you in your own bubble."
p603
aS'And take music justas an example I think we can all relate to.'
p604
aS"The reason I use Spotify, which is a socialmusic service, is that I'm a little bored with the music I already know, and I want to beexposed to stuff I don't know, which I get through my Facebook friends."
p605
aS'So back at thelevel of theory, could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your politicalperspective?'
p606
aS"I think it's much harder to do that than it seems."
p607
aS'News organizations arereally trying to do that.'
p608
aS"They actually haven't been very successful, which is why, whenyou go to newyorktimes.com, and I go, we get the same home page."
p609
aS"Of course, you canget narrow minded, politically filtered news, but you don't need the internet to do that.You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV."
p610
aS"Now, it is worthnoting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli's worried about.And that was the mainstream media before the internet."
p611
aS"When I was a kid in the '70s,you found out about the world through TV networks, a couple of news magazines, localnewspapers."
p612
aS"There weren't any national ones."
p613
aS'And it was a very limited range ofviewpoints and voices.'
p614
aS'And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble, all you haveto do is remove technologies before television, before radio, before newspapers.'
p615
aS'Sopersonally, I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter.'
p616
aS'I use it as afilter for stories that are relevant to me.'
p617
aS'And what it does is the opposite of narrowingmy perspective.'
p618
aS"Thanks to Twitter, I'm regularly getting news from global sources aswell as American ones."
p619
aS'I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the ArabSpring.'
p620
aS"I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiweithe Chinese artist who's become one of the most important dissidents in the worldtoday.And those filters broaden my perspective."
p621
aS'Twitter is a serendipity engine.'
p622
aS"Finally, Idon't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make upyour mind about tonight's motion."
p623
aS'All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simplequestion: Has the web narrowed my mind?'
p624
aS'Has it made me less tolerant of people Idisagree with and less interested in what they have today to say?'
p625
aS'Or has it exposed meto a broader range of voices, sources and ideas than we all used to get when we reliedon a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information?'
p626
aS"Unless you'reconvinced that the web makes you narrower, you should vote against tonight's motion."

p664
aS"And I'm going to convince you to support the resolution."
p665
aS'First, try to remember 1999, the days of AOL, the days of Prodigy, the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity.'
p666
aS'In 1999, Thomas Friedman wrote these words: "the internet is going to be like a huge vise.'
p667
aS'It\'s going to keep tightening and tightening that system --meaning the system of globalization -- "around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller, smaller and faster and faster.'

p669
aS"He's been exactly that wrong many times, but never more wrong."
p670
aS'Now, in 2012, it\'s clear that there is no such thing as "The Internet, capital T, capital I as Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s.'
p671
aS'There is no equalizing force, great democratizing force, there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes, for that matter.'
p672
aS'In fact, the alleged network of networks is, in 2012, balkanized, nationalized, compromised, anesthetized, supervised, circumcised and hypnotized.'
p673
aS"It's far from global, and it's getting less so every day."
p674
aS'The online experience of a person sitting in Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in China.'
p675
aS'And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil, in Russia or the United States.'
p676
aS"And we're talking about more than censorship, although, in many of those countries, online censorship is a serious and crippling issue."
p677
aS"We're also talking about platforms, the platforms that people use, the platforms that governments will let people use."
p678
aS'The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as well.'
p679
aS"Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication in an instant, we've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012, and we've seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States."
p680
aS'Internet technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want.'
p681

p682

aS'So here in 2012, or now in 2012, we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook friends across the globe singing, "We are the world.'
p686
aS'" There is no coordinated global movement for justice.'
p687
aS"There's no sophisticated online debate about our collective human state or even our basic human needs."
p688
aS'The dominant powers governing our digital experiences, the state, for instance, in China, or corporations in Brazil or the United States are not interested in such matters.'
p689
aS'They are not interested in us being political.'
p690
aS'Sometimes these powers actively restrict us, like in China.'
p691
aS'More often than not, these powers seduce us into shallow consumption, consumptive behaviors like shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows.'
p692
aS"Not that there's anything wrong with clicking on virtual cows, but it ain't political."
p693
aS'Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted, fractured and segregated into niches and nations.'
p694
aS'But all hope is not lost.'
p695
aS'There is nothing about the nature of the internet that prevents us from being political, richly political.'

p701
aS"We're also hungry for information."
p702
aS"If you weren't hungry, you wouldn't be here."
p703
aS'So many of us, despite what Facebook does with thoughts, despite what the Iranian government does in Iran, have managed to be richly political.'
p704
aS'But we do know that the internet by itself does not topple dictators, does not undermine newspapers.'
p705
aS"It's just not that simple."
p706
aS'If we recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems, we can correct, we can adjust, we can invest, we can invent, we can resist, persist, and thrive.'
p707
aS'We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend cosmopolitan perspectives.'
p708
aS"We just haven't done that yet."
p709

S'Thank you.'
p795
aS"Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history."
p796
aS'First, technology always plays the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind.'
p797
aS'Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," in the \'80s?'
p798
aS'Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones.'
p799
aS'And he actually argued that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents.'
p800
aS'We know what the late Allan Bloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried by the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me.'
p801
aS'The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as the .'
p802
aS'As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew Shapiro, which argued, and I quote, "Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia than cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and with information tailored to your desires.'
p803
aS'" That was 1995.'
p804
aS'Six years later, Cass Sunstein argued that, "The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views," end of quote.'
p805
aS'So enter Eli Pariser.'
p806
aS'In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiro and Sunstein.'
p807
aS'All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is taking place.'
p808
aS"But they're also different."
p809
aS'Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way out and simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters and algorithms are doing this for us.'
p810
aS"It's a very important difference."
p811
aS'Shapiro and Sunstein blame the filter bubble on us, the users.'
p812
aS'But Pariser blames it on the companies.'
p813
aS"Now, who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory?"
p814
aS"After all, it's always good to find someone else to blame but us."
p815
aS'I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that Jacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters naturally enhance our political culture.'
p816
aS"So let's take Twitter."
p817
aS'Many people think that Twitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering.'
p818
aS'That is actually not true.'
p819
aS'Twitter does hide certain types of messages.'
p820
aS"Thus, if you follow me but you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet."
p821
aS"Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my messages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva."
p822
aS'And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf.'
p823
aS'Is it paternalistic?'
p824
aS'Sure.'
p825
aS'Are these types of paternalism justified?'
p826
aS'Well, take my case.'
p827
aS"I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get."
p828
aS"But if I have to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of people that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000 people."
p829
aS'At best, I would follow 100.'
p830
aS"This is the beauty of it, Twitter's filter allows me to access more, not less useful information."
p831
aS"Now, let's take Facebook."
p832
aS'It has 800 million users.'
p833
aS'Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends and spend hours on it every day.'
p834
aS'Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen friends.'
p835
aS'So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation.'
p836
aS'If you are a heavy user, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order.'
p837
aS'Thats the most recent updates from all your friends come first.'
p838
aS'However, if you only use it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates.'
p839
aS'The assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30 minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order?'
p840
aS'To Facebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption.'
p841
aS'Thats why relevance rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users.'
p842
aS'If you want to see all the recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called most recent.'
p843
aS'Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is good or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, we should also accept that filters make it better.'
p844
aS'Now lets tackle the elephant in the room, which is Google.'
p845
aS'Suppose Im so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is larger than Glenn Becks.'
p846
aS'So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job.'
p847
aS'I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim, that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that the government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on.'
p848
aS'In other words, Im exactly the kind of guy that Eli is worried about.'
p849
aS'Furthermore, suppose that I became all of that before the filter bubble set in.'
p850
aS'In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to call the era of cable television.'
p851
aS'So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts personalizing my search results.'
p852
aS'Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11, actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends.'
p853
aS'In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well.'
p854

p856

p861
aS'So my point is this, that a link to the report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, is more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social filter.'
p862
aS'In other words, its a possibility that people would now be paying more attention or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial, only because their friends are known to endorse those positions.'

S"Thank you.Well, I'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with [[applause]] us, but I'd like to begin with a few lessons from history."
p877
aS'First, technology always playsthe scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind.Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book, "The Closing of the American Mind," inthe \'80s?'
p878
aS'Well, let me remind you, Bloom has actually argued that the closing of theAmerican mind occurs because of CD players and headphones.'
p879
aS'And he actually arguedthat those might incite teenagers to kill their parents.'
p880
aS'We know what the late AllanBloom would have made of the iPad, why his reactionary torch is now being carried bythe liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me.The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as [[laughter]] the .'
p881
aS'As early as 1995, the Nation Magazine carried an article by AndrewShapiro, which argued, and I quote, "Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbiathan cy-Berkeley, where you interact only with people of your choosing and withinformation tailored to your desires.'
p882
aS'" That was 1995.'
p883
aS'Six years later, Cass Sunsteinargued that, "The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism becauselikeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views,"end of quote.'
p884
aS'So enter Eli Pariser.'
p885
aS'In one respect, he follows in the tradition of Shapiroand Sunstein.'
p886
aS'All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation istaking place.'
p887
aS"But they're also different.Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we, the users, might choose the easy way outand simply award our comfortable viewpoints, but Pariser argues that filters andalgorithms are doing this for us."
p888
aS"It's a very important difference."
p889
aS'Shapiro and Sunsteinblame the filter bubble on us, the users.'
p890
aS'But Pariser blames it on the companies.'
p891
aS"Now,who doesn't like such an exciting conspiracy theory?"
p892
aS"After all, it's always good to findsomeone else to blame but us."
p893
aS'I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons thatJacob has outlined, but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filtersnaturally enhance our political culture.'
p894
aS"So let's take Twitter."
p895
aS'Many people think thatTwitter, unlike Google and Facebook, does not engage in customizing and filtering.'
p896
aS'Thatis actually not true.'
p897
aS'Twitter does hide certain types of messages.'
p898
aS"Thus, if you follow mebut you don't follow Siva, and I send Siva a public tweet, you will not see that tweet.Just think about it, you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of mymessages, but you're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva.And, mind you, Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf."
p899
aS'Is it paternalistic?Sure.'
p900
aS'Are these types of paternalism justified?'
p901
aS'Well, take my case.'
p902
aS"I follow more than2,000 people on Twitter, and I'm very happy with the breadth of news I get."
p903
aS"But if I haveto read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands ofpeople that they know but I don't know, I will have never managed to follow 2,000people."
p904
aS'At best, I would follow 100.'
p905
aS"This is the beauty of it, Twitter's filter allows me to access more, not less useful information."
p906
aS"Now, let's take Facebook.It has 800 million users."
p907
aS'Some of them are heavy users, they have 5,000 friends andspend hours on it every day.'
p908
aS'Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozenfriends.'
p909
aS'So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation.'
p910
aS'If you are a heavyuser, it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order.Thats the most recent updates from all your friends come first.'
p911
aS'However, if you onlyuse it occasionally, they will show you only the most interesting updates.'
p912
aS'Theassumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30minutes to catch up, why go through thousands of messages in chronological order?'
p913
aS'ToFacebook and to me, this seems like a reasonable assumption.'
p914
aS'Thats why relevancerather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users.'
p915
aS'If you want to see allthe recent messages, all you have to do, as Jacob said, is just click a button called mostrecent.'
p916
aS'Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking isgood or evil, but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity, weshould also accept that filters make it better.'
p917
aS'Now lets tackle the elephant in the room,which is Google.'
p918
aS'Suppose Im so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard islarger than Glenn Becks.So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job.'
p919
aS'I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim,that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media, that thegovernment is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on.'
p920
aS'In other words, Im exactlythe kind of guy that Eli is worried about.'
p921
aS'Furthermore, suppose that I became all of thatbefore the filter bubble set in.'
p922
aS'In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used tocall the era of cable television.'
p923
aS'So now comes the filter bubble and Google startspersonalizing my search results.'
p924
aS'Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11,actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends.In turn, when my friends use Google, they see the links that I visited and I liked as well.Now this is the new mutual exposure, why is it a good thing?'
p925
aS'Well if you think that allmy friends are nut cases like me, then we do have a problem, because exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid.But lets leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment.'
p926
aS'I dont thinktheyre representative of most internet users and their friends.'

aS'We seelinks from people we went to school with, our colleagues, our relatives, and so forth.Its quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11,climate change, Obamas birthplace, and UFOs.'

aS'So my point is this, that a link to thereport of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle, ismore trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar socialfilter.'

aS'And now it is time to learn which side you believe has argued best.'
p3601
aS"We're going to ask you again to go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote on which side you feel presented the stronger argument tonight."
p3602
aS'And we will get the readout pretty much immediately.'

aS'Press one if you support the motion that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.'
p3604
aS'Press number two if you are against this motion.'
p3605
aS'And press number three if you remain or became undecided.'
p3606

p3607
aS"And we'll have the results in about 90 seconds."
p3608
aS'So first, I want to ask -- I want to ask for a round of applause for our debaters, for the quality of -- -- of the arguments that they brought here tonight.'
p3609
aS'It was witty, and it was informative, and it went places.'
p3610
aS'Thank you very much to them.'
p3611
aS"Thank you also to everyone in the audience who had the guts to stand up and ask a question and to all the people who I didn't get to answer -- to ask questions, I wasn't able to allow to ask questions, thank you, very much for your contribution to those as well."

p3613
aS"It's our last debate of the season."
p3614

aS'" And we had actually set this debate up quite a while back.'
p3616
aS'It has -- it was not in relation to the Penn State scandal.'
p3617
aS'It was actually motivated more by reporting that was done about the business side of college football and the sometimes harsh nature of the sport on the bodies of the athletes who play it.'
p3618
aS'So our debaters will include somebody who wrote one of those articles, Malcolm Gladwell, who is author of "The Tipping Point," and "Blink," and he will be on the panel arguing for the motion.'
p3619
aS'And he wrote the piece in the New Yorker in which he compares college football to dog fighting.'
p3620
aS'His partner will be Buzz Bissinger.'
p3621
aS'He is the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author of Friday Night Lights.'

aS'That served as the inspiration for a movie of the same name and a critically acclaimed television series also of the same name.'
p3623
aS'Opposing them, we have a football player, Tim Green.'
p3624
aS'He is the former Atlanta falcons NFL defensive end, and Syracuse University all American.'
p3625
aS'He was inducted into the college football hall of fame in 2002.'

aS"That's a block away from here on Third Street between Thompson and Sullivan."

aS'Details are in the programs that you have.'
p3635
aS'But our idea was that we noticed a lot of times people walk out of here still kind of energized and revisiting the issues and debating among yourselves.'
p3636
aS'We wanted to give you a place to do it and get together.'
p3637
aS'And to share your ideas across the partisan divide.'
