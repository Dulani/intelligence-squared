S'Thank you. Thank --'
p357
aS"I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on"
p358
aS'topic this important. My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with'
p359
aS'some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start. But I just want'
p360
aS'to make two points this evening.'
p361
aS'First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the'
p362
aS"government that Americans have traditionally had. I'll come back to that point. Second,"
p363
aS"if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay"
p364
aS"for that government will largely come from the non-rich. Now, let's start with how high"
p365
aS'tax rates are. If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that'
p366
aS"about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid. If that's true, the current and"
p367
aS'projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are'
p368
aS"very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income. And, if you're New"
p369
aS"Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a"
p370
aS'lot on the table here. And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course'
p371
aS"corporate taxes were already paid there. And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that"
p372
aS"taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime."
p373
aS'All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income,'
p374
aS'44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond. Now, the calls for'
p375
aS"higher tax rates really raise two concerns. First, if you step back, they treat the nation's"
p376
aS"income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's"
p377
aS'sliced. An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes'
p378
aS'have on the decisions we all make. Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower'
p379
aS'activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes. The second choice here is that the real fiscal'
p380
aS'policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government. And here my'
p381
aS"observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we"
p382
aS'all will have to pay for it.'
p383
aS"The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich. Now, let's start, first, on the cost of"
p384
aS'raising tax rates. Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of'
p385
aS'course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you'
p386
aS'can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it. And'
p387
aS'economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high. Now, some of the'
p388
aS'somethings we get less of are work and saving. And, here, I just want to offer you a'
p389
aS'forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that'
p390
aS'"Glenn can\'t even forecast the past."'
p391
aS'And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what'
p392
aS"it's worth. But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast"
p393
aS'changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates. The responses of high income tax'
p394
aS'payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other'
p395
aS'tax payers.'
p396
aS'Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income. High business'
p397
aS'taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs. More than half of'
p398
aS'Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes'
p399
aS'at individual rates. Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring,'
p400
aS"discourages investment. If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher"
p401
aS"rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates"
p402
aS'in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise'
p403
aS'investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent. And high tax'
p404
aS"rates don't necessarily produce revenue. The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't"
p405
aS'varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70'
p406
aS'percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of'
p407
aS'lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times.'
p408
aS'The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by'
p409
aS'broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for'
p410
aS'those tax payers. Now, what about the larger government? Before the financial crisis,'
p411
aS'federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades. What'
p412
aS"if we decide we'd like a bigger government? Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger"
p413
aS"number, like many European countries. Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for"
p414
aS"that government? Well, the simple answer is no. Or, more accurately, it can't. If you"
p415
aS"look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may"
p416
aS'surprise some of you. The U.S. has the most progressive tax system.'
p417
aS'And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other'
p418
aS'country\'s tax system. So you think to yourself, "Well, how can this be? We\'re thinking of'
p419
aS'European nations with large government and social welfare programs." But the answer'
p420
aS"is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there's just not that much income at the top,"
p421
aS'and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those'
p422
aS'nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all'
p423
aS"citizens to fund their spending. So the real choice is the size of government. That's the"
p424
aS'debate we need to have first. Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance'
p425
aS'growth and living standards. The right tax system for this country can accomplish both.'
p426
aS' And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past'
p427
aS'few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax'
p428
aS'rates on high income individuals.'
p429
aS'If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay. The rich are not a'
p430
aS'plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch. For the proposition, The Rich Are'
p431
aS"Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes."

S'As you can see, the economy has worn me down.'
p469
aS"But we're in a recovery."
p470
aS'Look. I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a'
p471
aS"chance to vote against it again. It's an absurd motion for the following reasons."
p472
aS" Number one, we have a huge budget deficit. Even if we didn't want to expand the size"
p473
aS'of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a'
p474
aS'gigantic budget deficit. And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross'
p475
aS'domestic product. And the question is how do you get the deficit down? How do you'
p476
aS"get the debt down? Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got"
p477
aS'to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts. The Simpson-Bowles'
p478
aS'commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "Well, we have one'
p479
aS'dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts."'
p480
aS"But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn't the size of"
p481
aS'government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax'
p482
aS'increases. Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are'
p483
aS'in the middle, or is it people who are poor? And I want to tell you in terms of common'
p484
aS'sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top. Why, why, why?'
p485
aS"You can applaud, but don't take away from my time."
p486
aS'Why? Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good. I mean, the'
p487
aS'percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one'
p488
aS"percent, has doubled over the past 30 years. It used to be 10 percent back in 1980. It's"
p489
aS'now over 20 percent. That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20'
p490
aS"percent of total income. If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't"
p491
aS'just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years.'
p492
aS"If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total"
p493
aS'income over the last 30 years. The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the'
p494
aS'bottom 150 million of us put together. And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of'
p495
aS'distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really'
p496
aS"something new in this country, at least within people's living memory. It wasn't this way"
p497
aS"in the '50s or '60s or '70s. It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s. So, if we're going to"
p498
aS'have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the'
p499
aS'top. Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, "Well, you have a negative effect, a negative'
p500
aS'incentive effect." Come on. In the immortal words of Joe Biden, "Malarkey!"'
p501
aS'I mean, look. The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981'
p502
aS'-- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at'
p503
aS'least 70 percent. Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower,'
p504
aS"Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly would"
p505
aS'not have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes'
p506
aS'under Eisenhower was 91 percent. If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits,'
p507
aS"it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher"
p508
aS"than anybody today is talking about. We're talking -- right now, we're talking about the"
p509
aS"difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's"
p510
aS'days? I mean, this is a ridiculous debate. It should not even be debated obviously.'
p511
aS"Given where we were before and where we are now, we shouldn't even be raising this"
p512
aS'question. I mean, they will say higher taxes have a negative impact on economic'
p513
aS'growth. Well, guess what? In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher'
p514
aS'on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981.'
p515
aS' There was no negative impact on growth. I mean, George W. Bush reduces --'
p516
aS'remember 1981 -- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, "Oh, we\'re'
p517
aS'going to get this huge increase in growth, and we\'re going to get all kinds of jobs," using'
p518
aS'and spouting supply-side -- excuse me, Art -- nonsense --'
p519
aS'-- and what did we get? We actually had less growth. We had fewer jobs, even before'
p520
aS'the great crash. We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under'
p521
aS'the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised'
p522
aS'taxes.'
p523
aS'We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were'
p524
aS"created. That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth. We raised"
p525
aS'taxes, 22 million new jobs were created. I was secretary of labor during those times. I'
p526
aS'created every single one of those jobs.'
p527
aS'Thank you. Thank you very much.'
p528
aS'So just to -- in summary --'
p529
aS'-- we have to raise taxes in order to deal with the budget deficit, regardless of what your'
p530
aS'particular ideology is about a smaller or larger government. Number two, the rich have'
p531
aS"done extraordinarily well. Everybody else hasn't. In fact, median family incomes since"
p532
aS'2000 have actually dropped 8 percent. You want to put more taxes on average working'
p533
aS"people? No. That's simply not fair."
p534
aS"It's not going to work. Number three, the rich right now bear a lower, smaller, marginal"
p535
aS'tax burden than they have at any time in the post-war era. Of course you have to raise'
p536
aS"taxes on the rich if we're going to get on with the business of this country. So please"
p537
aS'vote against this silly proposition. Thank you.'

aS"and I -- but, Robert, you're a favorite of mine, and you have been for years; and, Glenn,"
p586
aS"you did a great job on this; and Mark, I'm anticipating your comments and -- but look at"
p587
aS'it, you got -- there would be three reasons you could possibly want to raise tax rates on'

aS"the rich. You're jealous of them, and Robert may be but he's one of them."
p589
aS"And the other thing is, you're going to get more revenue. And you're going to create"
p590
aS"prosperity. Those are the other two. And I'm going to land on the last two and look at"
p591
aS'the facts if I can. I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go'
p592
aS"back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we"
p593
aS"cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s. It was called"
p594
aS'the "Roaring 20s" for a reason. We had enormous expansion of growth, output, and'
p595
aS'employment. The top 1 percent of income earners, now, we have great data on the top'
p596
aS'1 percent of income earners. The IRS really likes to know how much you owe them.'
p597
aS' And we have great data. The top 1 percent of income earners, their taxes as a share of'
p598
aS"GDP soared during the period of the Roaring '20s. If you look at the 1930s, we raised"
p599
aS'the highest margin -- well, we first had May of 1930 we had the Smoot-'
p600
aS'Hawley Tariff.'
p601
aS'Then Hoover raised the highest tax rate on the rich from 25 percent to 63 percent. Then'
p602
aS'Roosevelt on January 1936 raised it from 63 to 79 percent and then up to 83 percent.'
p603
aS" There's a reason why it was called the Great Depression. The economy was in a"
p604
aS'shambles in large part because of the tax increases. The revenues from the top 1'
p605
aS'percent of income earners as a share of GDP went down during this period. You look at'
p606
aS'the Kennedy period where we cut the highest tax rates from 91 percent to 70 percent.'
p607
aS' We also put in the investment tax credit, accelerated depreciation, cut the corporate'
p608
aS'rates, did tariff reform as well -- the Kennedy-run tariff negotiation, tax rate -- it was'
p609
aS'called the -- it was called the "Go-Go \'60s," if you remember, a boom in the economy,'
p610
aS'and tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners went up during that period'
p611
aS'as a share of GDP. We then had the four stooges, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter.'
p612
aS'Which I consider to be the largest assemblage of bipartisan ignorance probably ever put'
p613
aS'on planet Earth.'
p614
aS'If you look at that period, we had stagnation for 16 straight years. The stock market'
p615
aS'collapsed during that period. Tax revenues for the top 1 percent of income earners'
p616
aS'went down as a share of GDP. Then we had -- then we had Ronny -- oh, excuse me, the'
p617
aS'sky is opened, the sun shone forth on the planet, the grass turned green, the animals,'
p618
aS'they multiplied, the children danced in the street, but we cut the highest tax rates of'
p619
aS"everything we could find. We had Steiger-Hansen in '78, then we cut the -- I mean,"
p620
aS'under Reagan, cut it from 70 percent to 28 percent. If you look at the whole period'
p621
aS'from 1978 all the way to 2007, we cut the highest tax rate on earned income from 50'
p622
aS'percent to 35 percent. We cut the highest tax rates on unearned income from 70'
p623
aS'percent to 15 percent.'
p624
aS'We cut the capital gains tax rate, we cut all of these tax rates across the board. We had'
p625
aS"a boom, and it wasn't just Ronald Reagan. Robert, your president, by the way, cut the"
p626
aS'capital gains tax rate dramatically; he got rid of capital gains taxes on owner occupied'
p627
aS'homes for everyone, he also got rid of the tax on retirees working, which was the group'
p628
aS'between 65 and 72. He also put in welfare reform, he also cut gtovernment spending as'
p629
aS'a share of GDP by more than the next four best presidents combined, and he had the'
p630
aS'greatest secretary of labor of all time --'
p631
aS'But he was a big taxer. We had huge growth during that period. If you look at what'
p632
aS'happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax'
p633
aS'revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP. By 2007, tax'
p634
aS'revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more'
p635
aS'than doubled.'
p636
aS"Let me tell you really honestly, you're not going to get the money from these guys."
p637
aS" You're not. They can hire lawyers, they can hire accountants, they can hire deferred"
p638
aS'income specialists, they can hire congressmen, they can hire senators --'
p639
aS"They can hire -- when you see a group of people hanging with the president, don't for a"
p640
aS"moment think it's a group of street people trying to explain to the president what it's"
p641
aS"like being poor. They're in there for some reason and they find it. You know, what you"
p642
aS'really want to do is get a low rate, flat tax, where you have no exceptions, no'
p643
aS'exemptions, no deductions, none of that stuff. And get them out of the business of'
p644
aS'trying to finagle their tax codes, get them out of the business of trying to influence'
p645
aS'government, get them into a position where they create prosperity and economic'
p646
aS'growth. And that is the way you got to go. We all want increased tax rates on the rich,'
p647
aS"but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it by"
p648
aS'lowering rates and broadening the base. And if I can correct one other little mistake,'
p649
aS'Robert, just a little one.'
p650
aS'Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici.'
p651
aS" They lower rates, they broaden the base. In '86, we cut tax rates on the rich"
p652
aS'dramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent. In the Senate, 97 votes for that, three'
p653
aS'against it, including Joe Biden. What was his malarkey comment? Excuse me, maybe he'
p654

aS"The statistics here are pretty startling. Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth"
p698
aS'distribution. If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50'
p699
aS"percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income."
p700
aS' They consume 60 percent of the total pie. So, from cars to clothing and everything in'

p703
aS'over the past 30 years. You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these'
p704
aS"statistics were very different. I'll just give you one example. I mentioned that the top"
p705

aS"So, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed. Our fiscal problems are obviously very"
p708
aS"significant as well. If you go back to the year 2000 -- we'll give Bob credit for the 22"
p709
aS'million jobs. Should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too? Okay, Bob.'
p710
aS" Let's clap for that."
p711
aS"There was a surplus, 2000. We've been running deficits ever since. The last fiscal year"
p712
aS'just ended. We had a deficit of $1.1 trillion. You can ask, "Well, what\'s going on?" Lots'
p713
aS"of things. There's the wars. That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years. That's"
p714
aS"Afghanistan and Iraq. There's the Bush era tax cuts. According to the nonpartisan"
p715
aS'Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period. And, of'
p716
aS"course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us"
p717
aS"about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years. You add it up, it's a lot of money."
p718
aS" So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle."
p719
aS'Now, the bad news is that -- it sounds pretty bad --'
p720
aS"The bad news is that if we -- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act. If they"
p721
aS"don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very"
p722
aS'self-reinforcing in a negative way. Take the deficits. If policymakers continue on with'
p723
aS"current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut"
p724
aS"spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax"
p725
aS"holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go"
p726
aS"from the current 70 percent -- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from"
p727
aS"35 to 70 percent -- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025. Now, all good research would"
p728
aS"show that we got a problem if that happens. The world's not going to work for us."
p729
aS"At some point, investors are going to balk. Interest rates are going to rise. It's going to"
p730
aS'affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards. That has to change.'
p731
aS" And the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to -"
p732
aS"- are firmly in place, and they're not going to change. There's many. Globalization -- a"
p733
aS'great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological'
p734
aS'change -- these are all really very good things for our economy. We need to continue on'
p735
aS'with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our'
p736
aS"lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth. I'm a person with no"
p737
aS"skills and talent, I'm getting creamed by trade. I'm competing against low-wage workers"
p738
aS"in China and India. I can't compete. I'm just getting crushed. And, of course, high"
p739
aS'income households are benefitting enormously, right? I mean, Glenn, Art, Bob go off to'
p740
aS'China, they go off to India, they go off to the UK to give a speech, they get paid very'
p741
aS'well.'
p742
aS"Unfortunately, I'm not in their class, you know? I don't get paid as well. But, it's"
p743
aS'globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth'
p744
aS"rises. And I think the problem here is that if we don't address the skewing of the"
p745
aS'distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, "Enough!" And they\'re'
p746
aS"going to stop the process of globalization, and they're going to rebel against the pace of"
p747
aS"technological change, and that's going to be to everyone's detriment, including higher"
p748
aS"income households. Now, here's the good news. We can solve this problem, and we"
p749
aS'can solve it together in a combined way. We have to think about addressing our fiscal'
p750
aS'problems through the prism of the income -- the distribution of income and wealth. So,'
p751
aS'we need to cut government spending? Absolutely. We have to do this. But, we have to'
p752
aS"do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs."
p753
aS' You know, take -- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance'
p754
aS'policies, but that only goes so far.'
p755
aS"We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare"
p756
aS"program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security. That'd only"
p757
aS"take us so far. So we have to address taxes. If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise"
p758
aS"tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right? I am all for tax reform. Let's"
p759
aS"close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden"
p760
aS"the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to"
p761
aS"cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right? I mean, that is the best way, that is the"
p762
aS"way proposed by Simpson-Bowles, that's the way proposed by Domenici-Rivlin, and that"
p763
aS"is a bipartisan way. So this is not hard. It's -- we can do it, and that's the good news."
p764
aS' Now, let me end this way with a personal note. I started my own company back 25'
p765
aS"years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother. And I wasn't in the"
p766
aS'proverbial garage but I was pretty close. It grew into a pretty good size -- a small'
p767
aS'business.'
p768
aS"I had 100 employees when I sold it to the Moody's Corporation. And the reason I'm"
p769
aS"telling you this is because I wanted to let you know that I'm not just an egghead. You"
p770
aS"know, I look like one maybe, but I'm not. So I look at these things through the -- in"
p771
aS'terms of data, theory, and experience. And my experience says, "You need to vote'
p772
aS'against this proposition." Thank you.'

p793

p795
aS' We have two teams of two arguing it out. The team arguing for the motion, Glenn'
p796

p797
aS'absolutely going to backfire, that taxes have consequences on behavior, and that the'
p798
aS'wealthy, who would be the provider of jobs by being the builders of factories would be'
p799
aS'discouraged from doing so.'
p800
aS'And that as a result of that, not only would they be able to dodge their taxes as Art'
p801
aS'Laffer pointed out by hiring lawyers and he also said hiring senators --'
p802
aS'-- but they will also not be giving jobs to people who would help broaden the tax base.'
p803
aS' The side arguing against the motion, Robert Reich and Mark Zandi, are saying, "It\'s'
p804
aS'absolutely common sense when you have to close a budget gap to go where the money'
p805
aS'is, that you go to tax the rich because they have an -- disproportionate amount of the'
p806
aS'wealth in the country to a degree that they never have before, and that the argument'
p807
aS'that taxing the wealthy will lead to depressions and recessions has not been borne out'
p808
aS'over certain periods of time. And we know that both sides to some degree are'
p809

aS' He was sitting there asking my friends and I need to have higher tax rates, and I looked'
p840
aS'at his letter to the New York Times, and he said he paid a little less than 7 million in'
p841
aS"taxes, and he said his tax rate was 17.4 percent, which I did the math, hold back, I'm a"
p842
aS'wiz, but I divided it. He had adjusted gross income of $40 million in that year.'
p843
aS'I then went to Forbes. His wealth increased from 40 billion to 50 billion. I went to the'
p844
aS'Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and what you found there is he gave 1.75 billion to'
p845
aS'the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not counting his sons foundations or his'
p846
aS'daughter\'s foundation. Now, as a definition of "income," to me income is what you'
p847
aS'spend, what you give away, and your increase in your wealth. It s called the Simon'
p848
aS'definition of income. If you look at Bill Gates -- I mean -- if you look at Warren Buffett,'
p849
aS'his income that year was $12 billion, and he paid 7 million in taxes. That is a tax rate of'
p850
aS"six 1/100th of 1 percent on his true income. That is obnoxious. But it's not because of"
p851
aS"any rates raising would change that tax. You've got to broaden the tax base by getting"

aS"rate in the Bowles-Simpson compromise plan is 28 percent. And that's financed by"

p931
aS'Second point, in fairness, is the OECD point that I made. If you look across industrial'

p933
aS'more on taxes that affect high income individuals that peer countries, and we do so for'
p934
aS'the reason I suggested. The third point I want to mention, if you add up all the tax'
p935
aS"increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in Washington, it's about 1"

aS"or any proposal that's reasonable, most of the onus of addressing our fiscal problems is"
p1065
aS"on the spending side. So, I'm with you on that."
p1066
aS'But, all of these proposals also say we need to generate revenue. This has got to be a'
p1067
aS'shared burden in terms of spending and tax. So, no disagreement there. The second'
p1068
aS'thing I say is that if we can raise tax revenue by lowering the deductions and credits in'
p1069
aS"the tax code -- and there're some very creative ways of doing it. Marty Feldstein has a"
p1070
aS'great proposal. Both Governor Romney and President Obama have put proposals that'
p1071
aS'are not dissimilar in this regard in terms of capping the amount of deductions and'
p1072
aS'credits that an individual can take, and that would burden -- in theory, would land on'
p1073
aS"higher-income households. I'm all for that. But I think it's also important that we do"
p1074
aS"this in a way that we're clear-eyed, because -- in a political sense, a political economy"
p1075
aS"sense -- because we know it's going to be really hard to scale back those deductions and"
p1076
aS'credits in the tax code.'
p1077
aS"It's -- you know, for every credit and deduction in the code, there is a constituency that"
p1078
aS'literally will go to war for it. So, we know that. So, in that context, we have to think'
p1079
