aS"Thank -- I'd certainly like to thank Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Center for an event on topic this important."
p475
aS'My partner, Art Laffer, the eponymous economist, will follow with some great thoughts on why raising tax rates is the wrong place to start.'
p476
aS'But I just want to make two points this evening.'
p477
aS'First, raising tax rates on the rich is both counterproductive and unnecessary to fund the government that Americans have traditionally had.'
p478
aS"I'll come back to that point."
p479
aS"Second, if we do want a larger government, and that's a political choice, the extra taxes to pay for that government will largely come from the non-rich."
p480
aS"Now, let's start with how high tax rates are."
p481
aS'If you look at survey data and ask Americans what they think is fair that about a quarter or a bit more would be fair in taxes paid.'
p482
aS"If that's true, the current and projected marginal tax rates -- that is the tax rate on the next dollar that you earn -- are very high for upper income folks, 35 percent for ordinary income."
p483
aS"And, if you're New Yorkers in this audience, you know that by omitting state and local taxes, I'm leaving a lot on the table here."
p484
aS'And 15 percent for dividends and capital gains, but of course corporate taxes were already paid there.'
p485
aS"And, on top of that, there's an estate tax that taxes money that had already been taxed once or twice in someone's lifetime."
p486
aS'All of these taxes are set to rise substantially next year, 40 percent for earned income, 44 percent for dividends, 24 percent for capital gains, and beyond.'
p487
aS'Now, the calls for higher tax rates really raise two concerns.'
p488
aS"First, if you step back, they treat the nation's income as an already big pie, and it doesn't really matter for the size of that pie how it's sliced."
p489
aS'An economic observation of that is that ignores a lot of incentives that taxes have on the decisions we all make.'
p490
aS'Those sorts of incentives would lead to lower activity, lower jobs, and lower incomes.'
p491
aS'The second choice here is that the real fiscal policy choice facing the nation is really about the size of government.'
p492
aS"And here my observation isn't economics, it's just arithmetic: if we want the larger government, we all will have to pay for it."
p493
aS'The bulk of the taxes will come from the non-rich.'
p494
aS"Now, let's start, first, on the cost of raising tax rates."
p495
aS'Now, I can look out and tell that your favorite course in college was, of course, economics, and you remember, from the public finance lecture in that class, you can boil it down to a simple sentence: if you tax something you get less of it.'
p496
aS'And economists worry, particularly, about tax rates that are already high.'
p497
aS'Now, some of the somethings we get less of are work and saving.'
p498
aS'And, here, I just want to offer you a forecast, and I should be honest with you that President Bush once said about me that "Glenn can\'t even forecast the past.'
p499
aS'" And I think what the president meant was data get revised, but you take that for what it\'s worth.'
p500
aS'But economists, like me, and my own academic research, have forecast changes in taxable income from changes in tax rates.'
p501
aS'The responses of high income tax payers are not only absolutely high, they are much higher than the responses of other tax payers.'
p502
aS'Of particular concern in this regard is the taxation of business income.'
p503
aS'High business taxes discourage investments in machines and ideas and jobs.'
p504
aS'More than half of Americans who work in the private sector work for businesses whose owner pay taxes at individual rates.'
p505
aS'Raising taxes on those business owners discourages hiring, discourages investment.'
p506
aS"If you make a comparison of next year's tax law, with higher rates, to the much bally-hooed Bowles-Simpson plan, you'd find that the lower tax rates in Bowles-Simpson that are financed by broadening the tax base, would raise investment in businesses by 54 percent, and raise hiring by 14 percent."
p507
aS"And high tax rates don't necessarily produce revenue."
p508
aS"The fact that revenue shares and GDP haven't varied substantially across periods when the top marginal rate was more than 70 percent, from when it was less than, or about, 28 percent, suggests that we have a lot of lost taxable income and a lot of wasteful tax planning when we have high tax times."
p509
aS'The right answer is tax reform to raise money from upper income households by broadening the tax base, and to seek expenditure reform that also reduces benefits for those tax payers.'
p510
aS'Now, what about the larger government?'
p511
aS'Before the financial crisis, federal spending in the U.S. averaged about 20 percent of GDP for many decades.'
p512
aS"What if we decide we'd like a bigger government?"
p513
aS"Let's say 25 percent, or maybe a larger number, like many European countries."
p514
aS"Shouldn't raising tax rates on the rich pay for that government?"
p515
aS'Well, the simple answer is no.'
p516
aS"Or, more accurately, it can't."
p517
aS"If you look across the OECD, the club of rich industrial nations, you'll find something that may surprise some of you."
p518
aS'The U.S. has the most progressive tax system.'
p519
aS"And, in fact, the U.S. tax system actually decreased inequality more than any other country's tax system."
p520
aS'So you think to yourself, "Well, how can this be?'
p521
aS"We're thinking of European nations with large government and social welfare programs."
p522
aS'" But the answer is simple, for reasons of arithmetic, that is, there\'s just not that much income at the top, and economics, consequences for investment and for jobs would be too grim, those nations actually use broad based consumption taxes, like a VAT that are borne by all citizens to fund their spending.'
p523
aS'So the real choice is the size of government.'
p524
aS"That's the debate we need to have first."
p525
aS'Taxation should be fair, but it should also seek to advance growth and living standards.'
p526
aS'The right tax system for this country can accomplish both.'
p527
aS'And so, for the government of the size that we all have been used to before the past few years, we can, we should, accomplish both fairness and growth without raising tax rates on high income individuals.'
p528
aS'If we, the body politic, want a larger government, we all must pay.'
p529
aS'The rich are not a plug number in a budget gambit for a free lunch.'
p530
aS"For the proposition, The Rich Are Taxed Enough, the answer is clear, and it's yes."

p624
aS'I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a chance to vote against it again.'
p625
aS"It's an absurd motion for the following reasons."
p626
aS'Number one, we have a huge budget deficit.'
p627
aS"Even if we didn't want to expand the size of government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have a gigantic budget deficit."
p628
aS'And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of gross domestic product.'
p629
aS'And the question is how do you get the deficit down?'
p630
aS'How do you get the debt down?'
p631
aS"Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's got to be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts."
p632
aS'The Simpson-Bowles commission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "Well, we have one dollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts.'
p633
aS'" But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn\'t the size of government, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the tax increases.'
p634
aS'Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who are in the middle, or is it people who are poor?'
p635
aS'And I want to tell you in terms of common sense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top.'
p636
aS'Why, why, why?'
p637
aS"You can applaud, but don't take away from my time."
p638
aS'Why?'
p639
aS'Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good.'
p640
aS'I mean, the percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top one percent, has doubled over the past 30 years.'
p641
aS'It used to be 10 percent back in 1980.'
p642
aS"It's now over 20 percent."
p643
aS'That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20 percent of total income.'
p644
aS"If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn't just double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years."
p645
aS"If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of total income over the last 30 years."
p646
aS'The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together.'
p647
aS"And this kind of asymmetry, this kind of distorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is really something new in this country, at least within people's living memory."
p648
aS"It wasn't this way in the '50s or '60s or '70s."
p649
aS"It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s."
p650
aS"So, if we're going to have to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on the top."
p651
aS'Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, "Well, you have a negative effect, a negative incentive effect.'
p652
aS'" Come on.'
p653
aS'In the immortal words of Joe Biden, "Malarkey!'
p654
aS'" I mean, look.'
p655
aS'The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981 -- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was at least 70 percent.'
p656
aS"Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly would not have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomes under Eisenhower was 91 percent."
p657
aS"If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits, it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higher than anybody today is talking about."
p658
aS"We're talking -- right now, we're talking about the difference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton's days?"
p659
aS'I mean, this is a ridiculous debate.'
p660
aS'It should not even be debated obviously.'
p661

p662

aS'Well, guess what?'
p664
aS'In the three decades before 1981, when taxes were higher on the rich, the economy on average per year grew faster than it has grown since 1981.'
p665
aS'There was no negative impact on growth.'
p666
aS'I mean, George W. Bush reduces -- remember 1981 -- 2001, 2003, he reduces taxes on the wealthy, saying, "Oh, we\'re going to get this huge increase in growth, and we\'re going to get all kinds of jobs," using and spouting supply-side -- excuse me, Art -- nonsense -- -- and what did we get?'
p667
aS'We actually had less growth.'
p668
aS'We had fewer jobs, even before the great crash.'
p669
aS'We had an economy that did not perform nearly as well as it did under the president I was very proud to have served under, that is Bill Clinton, who raised taxes.'
p670
aS'We had the largest and longest boom in modern memory, 22 million new jobs were created.'
p671
aS"That wasn't a negative growth, that was not a slowdown in growth."
p672
aS'We raised taxes, 22 million new jobs were created.'
p673
aS'I was secretary of labor during those times.'

aS"That's simply not fair."

p700
aS'I think this is an absurd motion, and I urge you to vote against it when you have a [[applause]] chance to vote against it again.'
p701
aS"It's an absurd motion for the following reasons."
p702
aS'Number one, we have a huge budget deficit.'
p703
aS"Even if we didn't want to expand the sizeof government, even if we want to contract the size of government, we still have agigantic budget deficit."
p704
aS'And the debt is about 85 percent, by some measures, of grossdomestic product.'
p705
aS'And the question is how do you get the deficit down?'
p706
aS'How do youget the debt down?'
p707
aS"Well, almost everybody who has looked at the issue has said it's gotto be some combination of tax increases and spending cuts."
p708
aS'The Simpson-Bowlescommission, to which my esteemed colleague referred to, said, "Well, we have onedollar of tax increases for every three dollars of spending cuts.'
p709
aS'"But there have got to be some tax increases, and the real question here isn\'t the size ofgovernment, the real question here is who is going to bear the brunt of the taxincreases.'
p710
aS'Is it going to be people mostly at the top, or is it going to be people who arein the middle, or is it people who are poor?'
p711
aS'And I want to tell you in terms of commonsense and logic and fairness, it ought to be people at the top.'
p712
aS"Why, why, why?You can applaud, but don't take away from my time."
p713
aS'[[applause]] Why?'
p714
aS'Because number one, people at the top have never had it so good.'
p715
aS'I mean, the [[laughter]] percentage of total income in this country going to people who are in the top onepercent, has doubled over the past 30 years.'
p716
aS'It used to be 10 percent back in 1980.'
p717
aS"It'snow over 20 percent."
p718
aS'That is people in the top 1 percent are now getting over 20percent of total income.'
p719
aS"If you're in the top one tenth of 1 percent, your share didn'tjust double, it actually tripled over the last 30 years.If you're in the top one-one-hundredth of 1 percent, your share quadrupled of totalincome over the last 30 years."
p720
aS'The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than thebottom 150 million of us put together.'
p721
aS"And this kind of asymmetry, this kind ofdistorted gap between the top and the wealthiest people and everybody else is reallysomething new in this country, at least within people's living memory."
p722
aS"It wasn't this wayin the '50s or '60s or '70s."
p723
aS"It wasn't even nearly this way in the '80s."
p724
aS"So, if we're going tohave to raise taxes, obviously fairness and logic would indicate you raise them on thetop."
p725
aS'Now, Glenn Hubbard is talking about, "Well, you have a negative effect, a negativeincentive effect.'

aS'" Come on.'

p728
aS'"I mean, look.'
p729
aS'The tax rate -- the marginal tax rate on top incomes -- go back before 1981 [[laughter]] -- for at least three decades before 1981, the top marginal tax rate in this country was atleast 70 percent.'
p730
aS"Under Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Dwight D. Eisenhower,Republican, who nobody would have accused of being a socialist -- Bill O'Reilly wouldnot have called him a communist -- and yet the marginal tax rate on the top incomesunder Eisenhower was 91 percent."
p731
aS"If you get rid of all the deductions and tax credits,it's still -- the effective tax rate under Eisenhower is closer to 56 percent, much higherthan anybody today is talking about."
p732
aS"We're talking -- right now, we're talking about thedifference between, what, a 35 percent tax rate and maybe going back to Bill Clinton'sdays?"
p733
aS'I mean, this is a ridiculous debate.'

p822
aS"I mean, in the 30 -- if you look at the growth rate there, we can go back in time, but, you know, if you look at the periods let's say from the Roaring '20s, we cut tax rates back then from 73 percent to 25 percent in the Roaring '20s."

p850
aS'We had huge growth during that period.'
p851
aS'If you look at what happened to the tax revenues from the top income earners -- you know, in 1980 tax revenues as share of GDP from the top 1 percent was 1.5 percent of GDP.'
p852
aS'By 2007, tax revenues from the top 1 percent of income earners was 3.2 percent of GDP, it more than doubled.'

p930
aS"We all want increased tax rates on the rich,but we want to do it not by raising rates, which won't work, we want to do it bylowering rates and broadening the base."
p931
aS'And if I can correct one other little mistake,Robert, just a little one.Simpson-Bowles lowers the highest tax rates on the rich, and so does Rivlin-Domenici.'
p932
aS'They lower rates, they broaden the base.'
p933
aS"In '86, we cut tax rates on the richdramatically, from 50 percent to 28 percent."

aS'The first, this is in no particular order of importance, but the first is, the skewing of the distribution of income consumption and wealth, and the second is our fiscal problems.'
p978
aS'The statistics here are pretty startling.'
p979
aS"Let's begin with the income distribution, wealth distribution."
p980
aS"If you take the top 20 percent of income earners, they take home over 50 percent of the nation's income, the top 20 percent take home 50 percent of the income."
p981
aS'They consume 60 percent of the total pie.'
p982
aS'So, from cars to clothing and everything in between, they consume 60 percent.'
p983
aS'And they own 90 percent of the wealth.'
p984
aS'These are pretty skewed statistics.'
p985
aS"And the more startling thing is they've gotten more skewed over the past 30 years."
p986
aS'You know, you go back to the early 1980s, late 1970s, these statistics were very different.'
p987
aS"I'll just give you one example."
p988
aS'I mentioned that the top 20 percent accounts for 60 percent of the spending.'
p989
aS'If you go back to 1980, it was closer to 45 percent.'
p990
aS"So, it's skewed, and it's getting more skewed."
p991
aS'Our fiscal problems are obviously very significant as well.'
p992
aS"If you go back to the year 2000 -- we'll give Bob credit for the 22 million jobs."
p993
aS'Should we give you credit for the surplus in the year 2000, too?'
p994
aS'Okay, Bob.'
p995
aS"Let's clap for that."
p996
aS'There was a surplus, 2000.'
p997
aS"We've been running deficits ever since."
p998
aS'The last fiscal year just ended.'
p999
aS'We had a deficit of $1.1 trillion.'
p1000
aS'You can ask, "Well, what\'s going on?'
p1001
aS'" Lots of things.'
p1002
aS"There's the wars."
p1003
aS"That's $1.2 trillion over the last 10 years."
p1004
aS"That's Afghanistan and Iraq."
p1005
aS"There's the Bush era tax cuts."
p1006
aS'According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that cost us $1.6 trillion over a 10 year period.'
p1007
aS"And, of course, there was a recession, the great recession, and by my calculation, that's cost us about $1.8 trillion over the course of the last 10 years."
p1008
aS"You add it up, it's a lot of money."
p1009
aS"So, we've got some big problems, very significant issues we have to tackle."
p1010
aS"Now, the bad news is that -- it sounds pretty bad -- The bad news is that if we -- these trends will continue if policymakers don't act."
p1011
aS"If they don't act, these trends will continue, and this will harm economic growth, become very self-reinforcing in a negative way."
p1012
aS'Take the deficits.'
p1013
aS"If policymakers continue on with current policy, if they don't do anything with the current tax rates, if they don't cut spending as agreed to as part of the sequestration, if they don't address the payroll tax holiday, you can go on and on and on, well, the nation's debt-to-GDP ratio is going to go from the current 70 percent -- and, by the way, it's doubled over the last 10 years from 35 to 70 percent -- it'll go over 100 percent by 2025."
p1014
aS'Now, all good research would show that we got a problem if that happens.'
p1015
aS"The world's not going to work for us."
p1016
aS'At some point, investors are going to balk.'
p1017
aS'Interest rates are going to rise.'
p1018
aS"It's going to affect investment, productivity growth, and our living standards."
p1019
aS'That has to change.'
p1020
aS"And the income and wealth distribution, the forces that are driving that aren't going to - - are firmly in place, and they're not going to change."
p1021
aS"There's many."
p1022
aS'Globalization -- a great recent piece in the New York Times, going over this, globalization, technological change -- these are all really very good things for our economy.'
p1023
aS'We need to continue on with the process of globalization and certainly technological change improves all our lives, but clearly it affects the distribution of income and wealth.'
p1024
aS"I'm a person with no skills and talent, I'm getting creamed by trade."
p1025
aS"I'm competing against low-wage workers in China and India."
p1026
aS"I can't compete."
p1027
aS"I'm just getting crushed."
p1028
aS'And, of course, high income households are benefitting enormously, right?'
p1029
aS'I mean, Glenn, Art, Bob go off to China, they go off to India, they go off to the UK to give a speech, they get paid very well.'
p1030
aS"Unfortunately, I'm not in their class, you know?"
p1031
aS"I don't get paid as well."
p1032
aS"But, it's globalization that allows them to get these great returns, and their income and wealth rises."
p1033
aS'And I think the problem here is that if we don\'t address the skewing of the distribution and wealth, the disenfranchised are going to say, "Enough!'
p1034
aS'" And they\'re going to stop the process of globalization, and they\'re going to rebel against the pace of technological change, and that\'s going to be to everyone\'s detriment, including higher income households.'
p1035
aS"Now, here's the good news."
p1036
aS'We can solve this problem, and we can solve it together in a combined way.'
p1037
aS'We have to think about addressing our fiscal problems through the prism of the income -- the distribution of income and wealth.'
p1038
aS'So, we need to cut government spending?'
p1039
aS'Absolutely.'
p1040
aS'We have to do this.'
p1041
aS"But, we have to do this in a way that's intelligent and maybe means-testing for entitlement programs."
p1042
aS'You know, take -- change the entitlement programs for the wealthy into insurance policies, but that only goes so far.'
p1043
aS"We don't want to go to the point where the insurance policies become a welfare program and we lose support for things like Medicare and Social Security."
p1044
aS"That'd only take us so far."
p1045
aS'So we have to address taxes.'
p1046
aS"If I were king for the day, I wouldn't raise tax rates on anybody, and I don't think we need to, right?"
p1047
aS'I am all for tax reform.'
p1048
aS"Let's close the deductions, let's close the loopholes, let's make the tax code fairer, broaden the base, I'm all for it, but let's use the revenue to address our fiscal problems, not to cut tax rates, until we're able to do that, right?"
p1049
aS"I mean, that is the best way, that is the way proposed by Simpson-Bowles, that's the way proposed by Domenici-Rivlin, and that is a bipartisan way."
p1050
aS'So this is not hard.'
p1051
aS"It's -- we can do it, and that's the good news."
p1052
aS'Now, let me end this way with a personal note.'
p1053
aS'I started my own company back 25 years ago with a good friend and my best friend and my brother.'
p1054
aS"And I wasn't in the proverbial garage but I was pretty close."
p1055
aS'It grew into a pretty good size -- a small business.'
p1056
aS"I had 100 employees when I sold it to the Moody's Corporation."
p1057
aS"And the reason I'm telling you this is because I wanted to let you know that I'm not just an egghead."
p1058
aS"You know, I look like one maybe, but I'm not."
p1059
aS'So I look at these things through the -- in terms of data, theory, and experience.'
