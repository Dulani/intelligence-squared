S'So just to start, I have to tell you I went to Oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, I was a New Yorker, she said, "How come you still talk like a New Yorker?'
p394
aS'" So it didn\'t work.'
p395
aS'But I never actually went to Oxford Union debates.'
p396
aS'And this is actually styled after it.'
p397
aS'I wish I had.'
p398
aS"So what I'd like to do first is just to talk about the way that we're going to branch out in terms of my teammate and I. I'm going to focus first on the domestic economy."
p399
aS"And actually because of what I do for a living, both in terms of the research I've done and the fact that I was a policy maker at the Federal Reserve, and my teammate John Taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong dollar policy."
p400
aS'So let me actually go out and make two points.'
p401
aS"And the first point is that when we think about what is good policy, I'm going to say what is a good policy for the American economy."
p402
aS'And in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now?'
p403
aS'And two things that I want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle, where are we in terms of unemployment?'
p404
aS'Not very good.'
p405
aS'We have unemployment rate of 7.7 percent.'
p406
aS'People are out there struggling.'
p407
aS"And furthermore, we're in a situation where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level."
p408
aS"So in fact we're in a situation where we're not doing as well as we'd like on either component of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy."
p409
aS'Furthermore, the economy is not growing that fast.'
p410
aS"It's been growing very, very slowly, hasn't really picked up yet."
p411
aS"So we're in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which is on the low side."
p412
aS"So now let's ask what would a strong dollar do?"
p413
aS"Well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that would make American goods and services more expensive; if they're more expensive people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services the way they did before."
p414
aS'What will that do?'
p415
aS'That will actually end up lowering the demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken further.'
p416
aS'Is that what we want?'
p417
aS"Absolutely not right now, because we'd actually get an economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower, which has been trending down, it'll go actually down lower."
p418
aS"So it's not the right policy at this particular point in time."
p419
aS"And so, in that sense, I think that it's a very bad policy to think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar."
p420
aS"So that's point one."
p421
aS"Point two is a little bit more subtle and I'm going to be a little more academic here, that I'm actually going to argue that it's a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong one or a weak one."
p422
aS'Why?'
p423
aS'Because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal policy, to actually stabilize the economy.'
p424
aS"At the current juncture we're in a situation where inflation is on the low side, we're actually in a situation where unemployment is on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don't want to have a strong dollar."
p425
aS'In fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong -- having tight policy would be the right thing to do.'
p426
aS'In particular, we raise interest rates rather than keep them low.'
p427
aS'And that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation.'
p428
aS"And we've been in periods where, in fact, we've had high inflation, very worried about it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy."
p429
aS'That would also result in a stronger dollar, then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction.'
p430
aS'A stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to go to policies that result in a strong dollar.'
p431
aS"The point here is that in a situation where you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that's not the ultimate objective for policy makers."
p432
aS'The ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have a very strong economy.'
p433
aS"So I'm going to end a little early, I'm told I get a little points for ending a little early."
p434
aS"But I made those two points and clearly there'll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard, which would be fun."

p540
aS'It preserves us from barter.'

p545
aS'The constitutional dollar was no placing of our monetary mandarins; it was a standard like the mile.'
p546
aS'Through most of the nations history, a dollar was defined under law as a particular weight of gold and silver, more often of gold, specifically of 23.22 grains fine.'
p547
aS'A little more than $20 was convertible on request into an ounce of gold, by and by the dollar was redefined.'
p548
aS'In the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of gold but still, still it was defined, anchored as something.'
p549
aS'Then came the fateful evening of August 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popular horse opera, Bonanza, President Nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar would have no definition, no anchor.'
p550
aS'No longer would Americas creditors have the option of converting 35 George Washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetary medium that nobody can print.'
p551
aS'Henceforth said Nixon, lashing out against unnamed speculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper.'
p552
aS'And that at least, is one political promise that Washington D.C. has faithfully kept.'
p553
aS'And what has this soft, undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought?'
p554
aS'Well in 1971, the gross public debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of GDP.'
p555
aS'As of yesterday, the gross public debt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 GDP.'

aS'Sweet it has been this privilege of America, the privilege of paying its foreign creditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print.'
p570
aS'But the unprivileged are fighting back.'
p571
aS'They too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra- low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing.'
p572
aS'You know, some years ago, the Financial Times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing, that is to say in laymens language, central banks conjuring of new paper money secured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it.'
p573
aS'I finally think I understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote.'
p574
aS'What I no longer understand is the meaning of the word money.'
p575
aS'Under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance their budgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square up accounts.'
p576
aS'I dont have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today.'
p577
aS'Deficits grow and imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetary sense.'
p578
aS'After all, we are playing tennis without a net.'

aS'And for that matter, without baselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls.'

aS'Incongruous this is as well, volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated, the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime of weights and measures.'

aS'And a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projects involve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes to an accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as Robert Crease relates in his book, "World in the Balance.'

aS'In the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of goldbut still, still it was defined, anchored as something.Then came the fateful evening of August 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popularhorse opera, Bonanza, President Nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar wouldhave no definition, no anchor.'
p616
aS'No longer would Americas creditors have the option ofconverting 35 George Washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetarymedium that nobody can print.'
p617
aS'Henceforth said Nixon, lashing out against unnamedspeculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper.'
p618
aS'And that at least, isone political promise that Washington D.C. has faithfully kept.'
p619
aS'And what has this soft,undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought?'
p620
aS'Well in 1971, the grosspublic debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of GDP.'
p621
aS'As of yesterday, the gross publicdebt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 GDP.Now think of the long-grade line of plans and resolutions to bring our national financesunder control.'
p622
aS'The institution of the Congressional Budget Office.'
p623
aS'Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the emergency deficit control act, Reaffirmation Act of 1987, and on and on,and now comes Paul Ryan.'
p624
aS'Will he be our messiah?'
p625
aS'Well maybe, but I doubt it.'
p626
aS'As longas the treasury can borrow at 2 percent and as long as the Federal Reserve can conjurehundreds of billions of what they are pleased to call dollars, with which to buy up theseemissions of debt, the red ink will continue to spill.'
p627
aS'Alexander Hamilton himself mighthave succumbed to the temptation.'
p628
aS'Anyway, in 1971, the final year in which the dollarwas anchored by something, anything, foreign governments held U.S. governmentsecurities on the order of $31 billion.'
p629
aS'$31 billion.These holdings today top $3.3 trillion.'
p630
aS'They are the spore of our non-stock deficit ondirt goods and services.'
p631
aS'Consuming more than we produce, Americans remit dollars bythe boatloads to our Asian creditors who obligingly return them by return mail in theshape of American investments in American IOUs.'
p632
aS'Its as if the dollars never left the 50states.'
p633
aS'Sweet it has been this privilege of America, the privilege of paying its foreigncreditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print.'
p634
aS'But the unprivileged are fightingback.'
p635
aS'They too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra-low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing.'
p636
aS'You know, some yearsago, the Financial Times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing,that is to say in laymens language, central banks conjuring of new paper moneysecured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it.'
p637
aS'I finally thinkI understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote.'
p638
aS'What I nolonger understand is the meaning of the word money.Under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance theirbudgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square upaccounts.'
p639
aS'I dont have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today.'
p640
aS'Deficits growand imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetarysense.'
p641
aS'After all, we are playing tennis without a net.'
p642
aS'And for that matter, withoutbaselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls.'
p643
aS'Incongruous this is as well,volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated,the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime ofweights and measures.'
p644
aS'And a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projectsinvolve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes toan accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as Robert Crease relates in his book,"World in the Balance.'
p645
aS'"Well, well, it\'s an ill wind that blows no one any good.'

aS"Well, just look at the quality of that man's suit.It's a fabulous business."
p650
aS'The more the currencies dance and swerve, the better it is for [[laughter]] Mr. Taylor and his hedge fund.'
p651
aS"To him, as to others in the forex trades, the very idea ofmonetary stability is -- it's worse than anathema."
p652
aS"It's unprofitable.I would no more expect him to espouse a system of stable currencies and fixed [[laughter]] exchange rates than I would an oncologist to welcome a cure for cancer.No, that is -- that's not my best one."

p693
aS'I would start out by saying that, Jim, your first statement to Rick was that you would be cutting the number of employees at the Fed.'
p694
aS"I would say that if we follow any of your policies, we'd be cutting the number of employees everywhere."
p695
aS'And, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every currency in the world is as good as paper.'
p696
aS"We're not worse."
p697
aS"We're not better."
p698
aS"But the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar that's as good as paper is convertible into anything."
p699
aS"You don't have to hold those dollars."
p700
aS'I give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where I tell people -- I hold up a Zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that\'s worth about 20 cents and tell people that "You shouldn\'t just keep your money in the United States, you should put your money around the world.'
p701
aS'You should be free.'
p702
aS'" But the fact of the matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the United States.'
p703
aS'Why can the Treasury borrow at 2 percent?'
p704
aS"They're not forcing you to lend them at 2 percent."
p705
aS"They're not forcing the Bank of England to invest its money at 2 percent."
p706
aS"They're not enforcing the Chinese to invest their money at 2 percent."
p707
aS'But they do.'
p708
aS'And, therefore, the dollar has a value.'
p709
aS"Paper or not, it's got a value."
p710
aS'And gold is not necessary.'
p711
aS'Also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of course, your currency is Zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that.'
p712
aS'By the way, the latest figure I saw was that the National Bank of Zimbabwe had $210 in its account.'
p713
aS"That's the central bank."
p714
aS"I don't know."
p715
aS"The value's probably changed in the last week or two."
p716
aS"But because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and that means Brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we're no longer on this standard where the U.S. has a -- you know, there's power over the world, we borrow in our own currency, and everybody else is stuck."
p717
aS'They have to, you know, balance their budget, do all the right things.'
p718
aS"No, unfortunately, in a way, from Jim's point of view, and I'm sure Steve's, as we'll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much."
p719
aS"I don't think it's a good idea, I don't think it's necessarily going to end well."
p720
aS'I believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the United States, as my partner Rick has pointed out.'
p721
aS'It would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a very strong impact on the rest of the world.'
p722
aS"If you're looking at the easy side of this from the U.S.'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have?"
p723
aS'Well, for a start it has a lot of impact on jobs in Ohio, in Michigan, in places where we actually produce things in the United States, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are to have a manufacturing sector.'
p724
aS'In 1985, when the U.S. had a strong dollar policy, and after a while a stated strong dollar policy under Ronald Reagan and Volcker, we began to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, "the rust belt.'
p725
aS'" And the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn\'t produce anything that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong.'
p726
aS'So now we all drive Mercedes and Toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that come out of Michigan.'
p727
aS"Now, let's face it, Michigan has other problems, and if you were -- I know I'm going to get defeated on this, Toyotas are all made in the United States, Hondas are made in the United States, yeah, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama."
p728
aS'There are reasons for that.'
p729
aS'But the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar -- the weak dollar today has brought these European and Japanese companies into the United States, even Korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too.'
p730
aS'One of the things that the Japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the Toyota plants come back to Japan so that they can actually employ Japanese to make Toyotas instead of people from Kentucky or Tennessee.'
p731
aS"So the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren't a hell of a lot of jobs."
p732
aS'How does the world do with the dollar?'
p733
aS'A strong dollar is bad for the world as well.'
p734
aS"And it's kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if youve got a strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us."
p735
aS'Right?'
p736
aS'Because everything looks cheap to us, right?'
p737
aS'And I must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look cheap to us.'
p738
aS'Now a lot of things look quite expensive.'
p739
aS"In fact, one of the worst things about a weak dollar is the fact that we can't go to Europe on vacation; it's too damn expensive."
p740
aS"If we had a strong dollar, Europe would be cheap and we could all go on vacation, but at the same time, all the New York City hotels would be empty, whereas now you walk around the New York City hotels, well, they're just loaded with people from places that I never thought could possibly afford New York."
p741
aS"And it's always interesting for me to sit and talk with somebody and have him tell me how much more expensive Belgrade is than New York."
p742
aS'That\'s like, "What?'
p743
aS'You got to be kidding.'
p744
aS"But they were serious But overseas, it's a little difficult to understand, but if the dollar is declining, then it's very inexpensive to build a plant, to finance your trade, because a weak dollar, which is the global currency because the dollar has been out there for years -- a weak dollar is the thing that you finance your trade in."
p745
aS"And if you know the dollar is going to be weaker in a year or two or three, you don't repay it."
p746
aS"You might be paying 6 percent for your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you're paying minus 4."
p747
aS"So it's a gift."
p748
aS'So when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from Citibank, from JP Morgan, from Goldman Sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system does very well.'
p749
aS'When the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, "Oh, my god, I now owe more for this loan, and my plant that I built in Thailand isn\'t as successful as I thought, and so I have to close it down and I have to lay off workers.'
p750
aS'" So when the dollar gets strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the United States is in a bit of a problem.'
p751
aS'Can we have a strong dollar policy?'
p752

aS'$3 oil went to $40 a barrel.'
p896
aS"When Reagan and Volcker stabilized the dollar in the '80s, crashed down to $10, stabilized to $20."
p897
aS'From the mid-1980s to the early part of this last decade when the Fed went off the rails again, dollar average -- average price of a barrel of oil more than $21.'
p898
aS'And now look what it is today, $80, $90.'
p899
aS'You saw it with the housing.'
p900
aS"We had an artificial housing boom in the late '70s, even worse one this time."
p901
aS'The housing bubble could not have happened without a weak dollar.'
p902
aS'So you get financial bubbles.'
p903
aS"Another thing that happens is, when you have a week currency, real wages go down, which is why the median income in the country's gone nowhere for 10 years."
p904
aS'Your salaries go down in real terms, which is why after 40 years of this nonsense, of having floating dollars like a floating clock, it takes two incomes in the family to do what one income could do several generations ago.'
p905
aS'So when the dollar goes down in value, you pay more for food; you pay more for gas; you pay more for electricity, which means money -- less money for other things.'
p906
aS'And so U.S. median incomes, as I mentioned, went down.'
p907
aS"And so workers do better when you have, in terms of improving their standard of living, people do better when they're in countries where the currency is stable, and they do worse in currency -- in countries over time that have weak currencies."
p908
aS'It also harms our security.'
p909
aS'Weak money, as I mentioned, has an artificial boost to commodity prices, particularly oil.'
p910
aS'That means vast transfers of wealth to commodity producers and the like, and also vast transfers lending trillions of dollars to countries unfriendly to the U.S. like Iran, Venezuela, and Russia.'
p911
aS'Weak dollar also has a moral dimension.'
p912
aS'It undermines social trust.'
p913
aS'It severs, or certainly weakens, the link between effort and reward.'
p914
aS'Wealth and progress is achieved less by hard work like gaining new skills, perhaps starting a new business, and more by speculation and gambling.'
p915
aS'Weak dollar means windfall gains, as I mentioned, for commodities and for exotic financial instruments and hurts small businesses and many start-ups.'
p916
aS'Faith in the future is undermined because it then suddenly becomes the present.'
p917
aS'Hard work is made a mockery of.'
p918
aS'You worry about whether you and your children, your grandchildren, are going to have a higher standard of living.'
p919
aS'The economy seems more like a casino rather than something where hard work can get you a better life.'
p920
aS'John Maynard Keynes summed it up very well.'
p921
aS'Keynes said, "Lenin was certainly right.'
p922
aS'There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than a debauched currency.'
p923
aS'" That is, weaken the currency.'
p924
aS'The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner in which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.'
p925
aS'What this means is, what we see happening today, this feeling that something is not right, this feeling that speculation, doing exotic financial instruments, greedy oil companies and the like is the way to get ahead instead of hard work -- it all relates to a weak and unstable currency.'
p926
aS'So just as you want 60 minutes in an hour, just as you want 16 ounces in a pounds, just as you want 5,280 feet in a mile, you need stability, fixed measure of value.'
p927
aS"That's all the dollar is, makes it easier to do commerce when it's stable in value."
p928
aS'You do more commerce, pure productive commerce.'
p929
aS"So bottom line is, wages suffer, investment gets skewed, we don't have a higher standing living that we would have had, and it weakens social trust."
p930
aS'Stable dollar is what we need, not funny money from politicians who think they know how to do our lives better than we do.'

aS'If the economy is growing too fast, it must act to slow the economy; and if the economy is growing too slowly, it must act to speed it up.'
p3607
aS'That is the policy that the government has been following for at least since World War II.'
p3608
aS"That policy, at least according to Jan Tinbergen, who did win a Nobel Prize in economics, the first one, given in 1953, said that there were four independent variables that drove the government's ability to control the economy and the economic outputs that are important to the people who live there."
p3609
aS"And so that's why I'm worried about the social welfare of the people."
p3610
aS'Those policies were money growth, interest rate levels, fiscal policy, i.e., the level of taxing and the level of spending, and the currency value.'
p3611
aS'Currency value was one of the four instruments that was chosen to manage the government output.'
p3612
aS'That was in 19 -- actually, earlier than 1953.'
p3613
aS"The Nobel Prize is never given to somebody who's done the work right then."
p3614
aS'But was involved with the Bretton Woods situation, and it was even-- by one of the leading economists of the world recognized that even under that time -- that currency movement was critical to keeping the world moving forward.'
p3615
aS'So my argument is that we should have a flexible policy that allows us to lean into the wind, or lean, -against it, depending on which way we need the government to act.'
p3616
aS'And so, therefore, we need that flexibility and we are against a strong dollar policy.'
