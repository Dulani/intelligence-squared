aS"you're undecided, which in our forum is a perfectly reasonable starting position, push"
p273
aS"number three. You can ignore all of the other keys. They're not live. And if you push"

S'So just to start, I have to tell you I went to Oxford for a year, and my mother, of course, I'
p294
aS'was a New Yorker, she said, "How come you still talk like a New Yorker?" So it didn\'t'
p295
aS'work. But I never actually went to Oxford Union debates. And this is actually styled'
p296
aS"after it. I wish I had. So what I'd like to do first is just to talk about the way that we're"
p297
aS"going to branch out in terms of my teammate and I. I'm going to focus first on the"
p298
aS'domestic economy. And actually because of what I do for a living, both in terms of the'
p299
aS"research I've done and the fact that I was a policy maker at the Federal Reserve, and my"
p300
aS'teammate John Taylor is going to focus on the international ramifications of a strong'
p301
aS'dollar policy.'
p302
aS'So let me actually go out and make two points. And the first point is that when we think'
p303
aS"about what is good policy, I'm going to say what is a good policy for the American"
p304
aS'economy. And in particular, the first thing we have to do is ask where are we right now?'
p305
aS'And two things that I want to talk about is where are we in terms of our business cycle,'
p306
aS'where are we in terms of unemployment? Not very good. We have unemployment rate'
p307
aS"of 7.7 percent. People are out there struggling. And furthermore, we're in a situation"
p308
aS'where we also have inflation which is actually too low, so inflation right now is actually'
p309
aS'running in the preferred measure, 1.2 percent, which is below their target level. So in'
p310
aS"fact we're in a situation where we're not doing as well as we'd like on either component"
p311
aS'of what we think s important in terms of stabilizing the economy. Furthermore, the'
p312
aS"economy is not growing that fast. It's been growing very, very slowly, hasn't really"
p313
aS"picked up yet. So we're in a situation with a weak economy and actually inflation, which"
p314
aS"is on the low side. So now let's ask what would a strong dollar do?"
p315
aS'Well, a strong dollar would actually mean that the currency would go up in value; that'
p316
aS"would make American goods and services more expensive; if they're more expensive"
p317
aS'people will buy less of them; that foreigners are not going to buy our goods and services'
p318
aS'the way they did before. What will that do? That will actually end up lowering the'
p319
aS'demand for our goods and services; as a result, our economy would actually weaken'
p320
aS"further. Is that what we want? Absolutely not right now, because we'd actually get an"
p321
aS'economy with higher unemployment and actually inflation, which would be even lower,'
p322
aS"which has been trending down, it'll go actually down lower. So it's not the right policy at"
p323
aS"this particular point in time. And so, in that sense, I think that it's a very bad policy to"
p324
aS"think that what we need to do right now is to strengthen the dollar. So that's point one."
p325
aS"Point two is a little bit more subtle and I'm going to be a little more academic here, that"
p326
aS"I'm actually going to argue that it's a mistake to have any dollar policy, whether a strong"
p327
aS'one or a weak one. Why? Because what policy should focus on is stabilizing the'
p328
aS'economy; we should use our tools, both in terms of monetary policy and also fiscal'
p329
aS"policy, to actually stabilize the economy. At the current juncture we're in a situation"
p330
aS"where inflation is on the low side, we're actually in a situation where unemployment is"
p331
aS"on the high side, so in this case, actually, we would think that we don't want to have a"
p332
aS'strong dollar. In fact, if our policies are expansionary, they might actually produce a'
p333
aS'weaker dollar; however, there are other circumstances where, in fact, a strong -- having'
p334
aS'tight policy would be the right thing to do. In particular, we raise interest rates rather'
p335
aS'than keep them low. And that would be a situation where we have a lot of inflation.'
p336
aS" And we've been in periods where, in fact, we've had high inflation, very worried about"
p337
aS'it, and in that situation we would want to have tighter policy, either higher interest rates'
p338
aS'for monetary policy or tighter fiscal policy. That would also result in a stronger dollar,'
p339
aS'then that would be okay, that would work in the right direction.'
p340
aS'A stronger dollar would weaken the economy, actually help lower inflation, and indeed'
p341
aS'in periods where we actually had to go out and control inflation we actually needed to'
p342
aS'go to policies that result in a strong dollar. The point here is that in a situation where'
p343
aS"you focus on the dollar, you may very well get it wrong because that's not the ultimate"
p344
aS'objective for policy makers. The ultimate objective for policy makers should be to have'
p345
aS"a very strong economy. So I'm going to end a little early, I'm told I get a little"
p346
aS' points for ending a little early. But I made those two points and clearly'
p347
aS"there'll be a lot of other discussion on these issues, maybe even the gold standard,"
p348
aS'which would be fun. I have bad news for you, Steve, your wish is not going to be'

S'What a strange proposition we are wrangling over this evening, ladies and gentlemen, a'
p400
aS'strong dollar, a not so strong dollar. The dollar is a unit of measurement. It measures'
p401
aS'the price of everything and anything. It preserves us from barter. It stores the value of'
p402
aS'work. The sine qua non of any unit of measurement is that it be fixed exacting,'
p403
aS'unwavering, true.'
p404
aS'My teammate and I, Steve Forbes favor a stable dollar so we oppose the motion in the'
p405
aS'same spirit we support the 12 inch foot, the well calibrated bathroom scale, and the'
p406
aS'more than 16 ounce serving of Mountain Dew.'
p407
aS'Now among the enumerated powers of congress is that to coin money and to regulate'
p408
aS'the value thereof and of foreign coin, and fix the standard weights and measures. The'
p409
aS'constitutional dollar was no placing of our monetary mandarins; it was a standard like'
p410
aS'the mile. Through most of the nations history, a dollar was defined under law as a'
p411
aS'particular weight of gold and silver, more often of gold, specifically of 23.22 grains fine.'
p412
aS'A little more than $20 was convertible on request into an ounce of gold, by and by the'
p413
aS'dollar was redefined. In the mid 1930s it was cheapened to 1/35th of an ounce of gold'
p414
aS'but still, still it was defined, anchored as something.'
p415
aS'Then came the fateful evening of August 15th, 1971, pre-empting the beloved popular'
p416
aS'horse opera, Bonanza, President Nixon announced that henceforth, the dollar would'
p417
aS'have no definition, no anchor. No longer would Americas creditors have the option of'
p418
aS'converting 35 George Washingtons into an ounce of bullion, that universal monetary'
p419
aS'medium that nobody can print. Henceforth said Nixon, lashing out against unnamed'
p420
aS'speculators, they always do, the dollar would be as good as paper. And that at least, is'
p421
aS'one political promise that Washington D.C. has faithfully kept. And what has this soft,'
p422
aS'undependable malleable post-1971 pure paper dollar wrought? Well in 1971, the gross'
p423
aS'public debt totaled 408 billion, or 38 percent of GDP. As of yesterday, the gross public'
p424
aS'debt totaled16.7 trillion, or more than 100 percent of projected 2013 GDP.'
p425
aS'Now think of the long-grade line of plans and resolutions to bring our national finances'
p426
aS'under control. The institution of the Congressional Budget Office. Gramm-Rudman-'
p427
aS'Hollings, the emergency deficit control act, Reaffirmation Act of 1987, and on and on,'
p428
aS'and now comes Paul Ryan. Will he be our messiah? Well maybe, but I doubt it. As long'
p429
aS'as the treasury can borrow at 2 percent and as long as the Federal Reserve can conjure'
p430
aS'hundreds of billions of what they are pleased to call dollars, with which to buy up these'
p431
aS'emissions of debt, the red ink will continue to spill. Alexander Hamilton himself might'
p432
aS'have succumbed to the temptation. Anyway, in 1971, the final year in which the dollar'
p433
aS'was anchored by something, anything, foreign governments held U.S. government'
p434
aS'securities on the order of $31 billion. $31 billion.'
p435
aS'These holdings today top $3.3 trillion. They are the spore of our non-stock deficit on'
p436
aS'dirt goods and services. Consuming more than we produce, Americans remit dollars by'
p437
aS'the boatloads to our Asian creditors who obligingly return them by return mail in the'
p438
aS'shape of American investments in American IOUs. Its as if the dollars never left the 50'
p439
aS'states. Sweet it has been this privilege of America, the privilege of paying its foreign'
p440
aS'creditors in the currency that only it may lawfully print. But the unprivileged are fighting'
p441
aS'back. They too are cheapening their currencies through the modern techniques of ultra-'
p442
aS'low interest rates and that cut glass phrase, quantitative easing. You know, some years'
p443
aS'ago, the Financial Times published a letter to the editor concerning quantitative easing,'
p444
aS'that is to say in laymens language, central banks conjuring of new paper money'
p445
aS'secured by nothing except the good faith of the government that prints it. I finally think'
p446
aS'I understand the meaning of quantitative easing this correspondent wrote. What I no'
p447
aS'longer understand is the meaning of the word money.'
p448
aS'Under the rules of the true blue gold standard, governments tended to balance their'
p449
aS'budgets and international debtors and creditors tended in a timely fashion to square up'
p450
aS'accounts. I dont have to tell you that no such constraints bind us today. Deficits grow'
p451
aS'and imbalances pile higher and higher, as you would expect them to, in a monetary'
p452
aS'sense. After all, we are playing tennis without a net. And for that matter, without'
p453
aS'baselines or sidelines and with imaginary green balls. Incongruous this is as well,'
p454
aS'volatile currencies, due to their mis-shift in a world increasingly and finely calibrated,'
p455
aS'the international system of units binds every commercial nation in a rigorous regime of'
p456
aS'weights and measures. And a good thing too, as 21st century engineering projects'
p457
aS'involve myriad interrelated elements which all must be measured alike, sometimes to'
p458
aS'an accuracy of up to one part in a million or more, as Robert Crease relates in his book,'
p459
aS'"World in the Balance."'
p460
aS"Well, well, it's an ill wind that blows no one any good. Unanchored exchange rates have"
p461
aS'created a cottage industry and monetary volatility. John Taylor. John Taylor, from'
p462
aS"whom you'll hear in a moment has built a thriving foreign exchange trading business on"
p463
aS"the ashes of the good as gold dollar. Well, just look at the quality of that man's suit."
p464
aS"It's a fabulous business. The more the currencies dance and swerve, the better it is for"
p465
aS'Mr. Taylor and his hedge fund. To him, as to others in the forex trades, the very idea of'
p466
aS"monetary stability is -- it's worse than anathema. It's unprofitable."
p467
aS'I would no more expect him to espouse a system of stable currencies and fixed'
p468
aS'exchange rates than I would an oncologist to welcome a cure for cancer.'
p469
aS"No, that is -- that's not my best one."
p470
aS'Our post-1971 helter-skelter monetary system also favors the prodigious talents of'

p515
aS"not like Jim's which is dealing with the world the way he would like it to be."
p516
aS'I would start out by saying that, Jim, your first statement to Rick was that you would be'
p517
aS'cutting the number of employees at the Fed. I would say that if we follow any of your'
p518

p519
aS'And, unfortunately, unfortunately, yes, the dollar is as good as paper, and every'
p520
aS'currency in the world is as good as paper.'
p521
aS"We're not worse. We're not better. But the fact of the matter is, is that your dollar"
p522
aS"that's as good as paper is convertible into anything. You don't have to hold those"
p523
aS'dollars. I give another speech trying to sell our cash management program where I tell'
p524
aS"people -- I hold up a Zimbabwean hundred trillion dollar note that's worth about 20"
p525
aS'cents and tell people that "You shouldn\'t just keep your money in the United States, you'
p526
aS'should put your money around the world. You should be free." But the fact of the'
p527
aS'matter is, is that almost everybody wants to keep their money in the United States.'
p528
aS"Why can the Treasury borrow at 2 percent? They're not forcing you to lend them at 2"
p529
aS"percent. They're not forcing the Bank of England to invest its money at 2 percent."
p530
aS"They're not enforcing the Chinese to invest their money at 2 percent. But they do. And,"
p531
aS"therefore, the dollar has a value. Paper or not, it's got a value. And gold is not"
p532
aS'necessary.'
p533
aS'Also today everybody has the pleasure of borrowing with their own currency unless, of'
p534
aS'course, your currency is Zimbabwe and nobody wants to hold that. By the way, the'
p535
aS'latest figure I saw was that the National Bank of Zimbabwe had $210 in its account.'
p536
aS"That's the central bank. I don't know. The value's probably changed in the last week or"
p537
aS'two. But because everyone has the privilege of borrowing in their own currency, and'
p538
aS"that means Brazil, all kinds of emerging countries, we're no longer on this standard"
p539
aS"where the U.S. has a -- you know, there's power over the world, we borrow in our own"
p540
aS'currency, and everybody else is stuck. They have to, you know, balance their budget, do'
p541
aS"all the right things. No, unfortunately, in a way, from Jim's point of view, and I'm sure"
p542
aS"Steve's, as we'll hear, everybody has this ability to borrow too much. I don't think it's a"
p543
aS"good idea, I don't think it's necessarily going to end well."
p544
aS'I believe in a lot of things that tend to be conservative, but the fact of the matter is that'
p545
aS'a strong dollar policy has a lot of impact on the United States, as my partner Rick has'
p546
aS'pointed out. It would hurt us dramatically if that happened, and also, the dollar has a'
p547
aS"very strong impact on the rest of the world. If you're looking at the easy side of this"
p548
aS"from the U.S.'s point of view, what impact does a strong dollar have? Well, for a start it"
p549
aS'has a lot of impact on jobs in Ohio, in Michigan, in places where we actually produce'
p550
aS'things in the United States, because the stronger our dollar is, the less likely it is we are'
p551
aS'to have a manufacturing sector. In 1985, when the U.S. had a strong dollar policy, and'
p552
aS'after a while a stated strong dollar policy under Ronald Reagan and Volcker, we began'
p553
aS'to develop something that we now call, and it came into practice then, "the rust belt."'
p554
aS"And the reason that was the rust belt is all of a sudden we couldn't produce anything"
p555
aS'that could compete with the rest of the world because the dollar was too damn strong.'
p556
aS' So now we all drive Mercedes and Toyotas and whatever, we do not drive things that'
p557
aS"come out of Michigan. Now, let's face it, Michigan has other problems, and if you were"
p558
aS"-- I know I'm going to get defeated on this, Toyotas are all made in the United States,"
p559
aS'Hondas are made in the United States, yeah, in Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama. There'
p560
aS'are reasons for that. But the fact of the matter is that the strong dollar -- the weak'
p561
aS'dollar today has brought these European and Japanese companies into the United'
p562
aS'States, even Korean, and if we had a strong dollar they would go, too. One of the things'
p563
aS'that the Japanese are trying to do with their latest effort is to make the Toyota plants'
p564
aS'come back to Japan so that they can actually employ Japanese to make Toyotas instead'
p565
aS'of people from Kentucky or Tennessee.'
p566
aS'So the dollar is very, very important domestically for us, and basically if you have a'
p567
aS"strong dollar you end up with a situation where the rich get richer and there aren't a hell"
p568
aS'of a lot of jobs.'
p569
aS'How does the world do with the dollar? A strong dollar is bad for the world as well.'
p570
aS"And it's kind of perverse, because if you would argue that, oh, gee whiz, if youve got a"
p571
aS'strong dollar, then anybody can sell anything to us. Right? Because everything looks'
p572
aS'cheap to us, right? And I must say that, you know, in the 1960s everything did look'
p573
aS'cheap to us. Now a lot of things look quite expensive. In fact, one of the worst things'
p574
aS"about a weak dollar is the fact that we can't go to Europe on vacation; it's too damn"
p575
aS'expensive. If we had a strong dollar, Europe would be cheap and we could all go on'
p576
aS'vacation, but at the same time, all the New York City hotels would be empty, whereas'
p577
aS"now you walk around the New York City hotels, well, they're just loaded with people"
p578
aS"from places that I never thought could possibly afford New York. And it's always"
p579
aS'interesting for me to sit and talk with somebody and have him tell me how much more'
p580
aS'expensive Belgrade is than New York. That\'s like, "What? You got to be kidding. But'
p581
aS'they were serious'
p582
aS"But overseas, it's a little difficult to understand, but if the dollar is declining, then it's"
p583
aS'very inexpensive to build a plant, to finance your trade, because a weak dollar, which is'
p584
aS'the global currency because the dollar has been out there for years -- a weak dollar is'
p585
aS'the thing that you finance your trade in. And if you know the dollar is going to be'
p586
aS"weaker in a year or two or three, you don't repay it. You might be paying 6 percent for"
p587
aS"your dollars, but hell, if the dollar goes down 10 percent a year, you're paying minus 4."
p588
aS"So it's a gift. So when the dollar is weak, people borrow money from Citibank, from JP"
p589
aS'Morgan, from Goldman Sachs, the people doing these deals, and our banking system'
p590
aS'does very well.'
p591
aS'When the dollar is strong, all of a sudden these people are, "Oh, my god, I now owe'
p592
aS"more for this loan, and my plant that I built in Thailand isn't as successful as I thought,"
p593
aS'and so I have to close it down and I have to lay off workers." So when the dollar gets'
p594
aS'strong, all of a sudden the rest of the world economies go down, and so, actually, the'
p595
aS'United States is in a bit of a problem. Can we have a strong dollar policy? We argue'
p596
aS"strongly that we can't, because there is no place for us to do it. We have to support the"
p597
aS'world.'

p631
aS"emphasize with Jim that we believe in a strong and stable dollar. We don't like inflation;"
p632
aS'we don\'t like deflation. We like "flation." Stability.'
p633
aS"This -- so let's lead. What is money? Money makes it easier to buy and sell with one"
p634
aS'another, to do transactions with each other. It is through buying and selling that wealth'
p635
aS'is ultimately created, doing things, interacting with each other. Before we had money,'
p636
aS'in the old days we had barter. If I sold an ad in Forbes Magazine 3,000 years ago, how'
p637
aS"would I get paid? Perhaps with a herd of goats. Let's say I wanted to buy iPads for our"
p638
aS'writers, so I go to the iPad store 3,000 years ago with my goats. Store owner says he'
p639
aS"doesn't want goats; he wants sheep. So then I have to figure out how I swap my goats"
p640
aS"for sheep. Perhaps I have to hire a sheep herder so the wolves don't eat the sheep."
p641
aS"Sheep herder wants to be paid in wine. I've got red wine; he wants white wine. So it"
p642
aS'becomes very, very cumbersome.'
p643
aS'Money makes all this easier, more convenient to do those transactions. So we got coins'
p644
aS'in Lydia 2,600 years ago. Then Athens picked it up, became a great commercial and'
p645
aS'cultural center. Got coins, and then paper, and then blips on a computer, but all of it'
p646
aS'means it makes it easier to do commerce, makes it easier to buy and sell with one'
p647
aS"another. That's the function of money."
p648
aS'If we had barter today, imagine what it would be like, trying to deposit a cow into an'
p649
aS'ATM or take out a pig from an ATM. So we have money, and money is like anything,'
p650
aS'fixed weight and measure. If it has a fixed value, it becomes extremely useful.'
p651
aS'We have -- when you go to the supermarket, say, buy a pound of hamburger, you'
p652
aS"assume it has 16 ounces, not 18, not 12. We don't float that pound from the British"
p653
aS'pound. But you know when you go to the market, 16 ounces. Twelve inches in a foot,'
p654
aS"that doesn't float. Imagine building a house 3,000 square feet if the rule floats each day."
p655
aS'Take -- what would your life be like if the Federal Reserve did to the clock what it does'
p656
aS"to the dollar? Float the clock. So it's 60 minutes in an hour one day, 20 minutes the"
p657
aS"next, 22 the next, 90 the next. You'd soon need to have hedges, derivatives futures, to"
p658
aS"figure out how many hours you're working."
p659
aS"So let's say you hire somebody, 15 bucks an hour, do you pay that -- is that a New York"
p660
aS"hour? New Jersey hour? Bangladesh hour? Let's say you're baking a cake. It says bake"
p661
aS'the batter 45 minutes. You have to figure out, is that an inflation-adjusted minute?'
p662
aS'So a weak dollar, unstable dollar, makes commerce harder, and it has very destructive'
p663
aS"impacts. First of all, it misdirects investment. Without investment, we don't get a"
p664
aS'higher standard of living. A weak dollar is like a virus in a computer, corrupts the'
p665
aS'information. When the dollar becomes weak, what happens to the flow of investment'
p666
aS'money? It becomes defensive. It goes into commodities. Try to preserve what you'
p667
aS'have instead of invest to grow in the future. You saw it in the 1970s. $3 oil went to $40'
p668
aS"a barrel. When Reagan and Volcker stabilized the dollar in the '80s, crashed down to"
p669
aS'$10, stabilized to $20. From the mid-1980s to the early part of this last decade when'
p670
aS'the Fed went off the rails again, dollar average -- average price of a barrel of oil more'
p671
aS'than $21. And now look what it is today, $80, $90.'
p672
aS"You saw it with the housing. We had an artificial housing boom in the late '70s, even"
p673
aS'worse one this time. The housing bubble could not have happened without a weak'
p674
aS'dollar. So you get financial bubbles. Another thing that happens is, when you have a'
p675
aS"week currency, real wages go down, which is why the median income in the country's"
p676
aS'gone nowhere for 10 years. Your salaries go down in real terms, which is why after 40'
p677
aS'years of this nonsense, of having floating dollars like a floating clock, it takes two'
p678
aS'incomes in the family to do what one income could do several generations ago. So'
p679
aS'when the dollar goes down in value, you pay more for food; you pay more for gas; you'
p680
aS'pay more for electricity, which means money -- less money for other things. And so U.S.'
p681
aS'median incomes, as I mentioned, went down. And so workers do better when you have,'
p682
aS"in terms of improving their standard of living, people do better when they're in"
p683
aS'countries where the currency is stable, and they do worse in currency -- in countries'
p684
aS'over time that have weak currencies.'
p685
aS'It also harms our security. Weak money, as I mentioned, has an artificial boost to'
p686
aS'commodity prices, particularly oil. That means vast transfers of wealth to commodity'
p687
aS'producers and the like, and also vast transfers lending trillions of dollars to countries'
p688
aS'unfriendly to the U.S. like Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. Weak dollar also has a moral'
p689
aS'dimension. It undermines social trust. It severs, or certainly weakens, the link between'
p690
aS'effort and reward.'
p691
aS'Wealth and progress is achieved less by hard work like gaining new skills, perhaps'
p692
aS'starting a new business, and more by speculation and gambling. Weak dollar means'
p693
aS'windfall gains, as I mentioned, for commodities and for exotic financial instruments and'
p694
aS'hurts small businesses and many start-ups. Faith in the future is undermined because it'
p695
aS'then suddenly becomes the present. Hard work is made a mockery of. You worry about'
p696
aS'whether you and your children, your grandchildren, are going to have a higher standard'
p697
aS'of living. The economy seems more like a casino rather than something where hard'
p698
aS'work can get you a better life. John Maynard Keynes summed it up very well. Keynes'
p699
aS'said, "Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the'
p700
aS'existing basis of society than a debauched currency." That is, weaken the currency. The'
p701
aS'process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and'
p702
aS'does it in a manner in which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.'
p703
aS'What this means is, what we see happening today, this feeling that something is not'
p704
aS'right, this feeling that speculation, doing exotic financial instruments, greedy oil'
p705
aS'companies and the like is the way to get ahead instead of hard work -- it all relates to a'
p706
aS'weak and unstable currency. So just as you want 60 minutes in an hour, just as you'
p707
aS'want 16 ounces in a pounds, just as you want 5,280 feet in a mile, you need stability,'
p708
aS"fixed measure of value. That's all the dollar is, makes it easier to do commerce when it's"
p709
aS'stable in value. You do more commerce, pure productive commerce. So bottom line is,'
p710
aS"wages suffer, investment gets skewed, we don't have a higher standing living that we"
p711
aS'would have had, and it weakens social trust. Stable dollar is what we need, not funny'

p760
aS'overriding long run -- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy. And in that'
p761
aS'context, youre absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a'
p762
aS'lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing. Im in no way advocating that.'
p763
aS'And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable'
p764
aS'inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to'
p765
aS'the gold standard, I think doesnt fly. So let me give you reasons why. If you actually'
p766
aS'look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the'
p767
aS'currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth lets say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth'
p768
aS'ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period. The problem is that youre'
p769
aS'now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars. And in'
p770
aS'particular, this is a period where in fact there wasnt a good dollar yardstick in the'
p771
aS'following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold'
p772
aS'standard period than we have now. Now what did happen in that period and one of the'
p773
aS'problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God.'
p774
aS'So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880 -- from 1880 to about 1896,'
p775
aS'because they couldnt find any gold. Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and'
p776
aS'actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the'
p777
aS'ground. So theres really an issue of technology here. The question is, can you actually'
p778
aS'get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan'
p779
aS'Greenspan I think said rightly so, is its like pornography, you know it when you see it.'
p780
aS'Its when you dont worry about whats happening to the price level in your day to day'

p2595
aS'must lean against the wind, whichever way that wind is blowing. If the economy is'
p2596
aS'growing too fast, it must act to slow the economy; and if the economy is growing too'
p2597
aS'slowly, it must act to speed it up. That is the policy that the government has been'
p2598
aS'following for at least since World War II. That policy, at least according to Jan'
p2599
aS'Tinbergen, who did win a Nobel Prize in economics, the first one, given in 1953, said'
p2600
aS"that there were four independent variables that drove the government's ability to"
p2601
aS'control the economy and the economic outputs that are important to the people who'
p2602
aS"live there. And so that's why I'm worried about the social welfare of the people."
p2603
aS'Those policies were money growth, interest rate levels, fiscal policy, i.e., the level of'
p2604
aS'taxing and the level of spending, and the currency value. Currency value was one of the'
p2605
aS'four instruments that was chosen to manage the government output. That was in 19 --'
p2606
aS"actually, earlier than 1953. The Nobel Prize is never given to somebody who's done the"

p2608
aS'by one of the leading economists of the world recognized that even under that time --'
p2609
aS'that currency movement was critical to keeping the world moving forward. So my'

aS'Well, put that way, it is absolutely ridiculous thinking if you change a measure of'
p2641
aS'something that, therefore, you can achieve a desired result. Inflation is the equivalent'
p2642
aS'of changing the number of ounces in a pound or changing how a mirror makes you look,'
p2643
aS'it is distortive, ridiculous, and destructive. Inflation is legalized counterfeiting, whether'
p2644
aS'its two percent a year or 20 percent. Dollar should be a fixed measure of value. Its'
p2645
aS'simply a yardstick, to make transactions easier. Otherwise, its like a virus in a'
p2646
aS'computer. It corrupts the information; you cant trust prices. You get a decline in'
p2647
aS'personal incomes, weakening social trust, distortion and misdirection of investment into'

aS'things that, hard assets instead of things of the future. And also as a transfer of wealth,'

S'So Im not going to use higher mathematics. In fact, thats never been really part of this'
p2671
aS'discussion. But I do want to talk about history. And in fact, theres a very wonderful'
p2672
aS'example about what happens when you pursue a strong currency policy. It happened to'
p2673
aS'deal with a great man who was great in helping save the world against Hitler, but was'
p2674
aS'not a very good economist. He was not a very good chancellor of the exchequer, which'
p2675
aS'is the equivalent of the finance minister, or Secretary of the Treasury, and this is'
p2676
aS'Winston Churchill.'
p2677
aS'But what the U.K. decided to do after World War I, was to pursue a strong pound policy.'
p2678
aS'They went back on the dollar -- on the pound -- excuse me, they went back on the gold'
p2679
aS'standard in 1925. They started taking measures to do this starting right after the war.'
p2680
aS'What was the result of this? Well, in order to do this they actually had very tight'
p2681
aS'monetary policy, very high interest rates. Were they successful? Absolutely, in 1925,'
p2682
aS'they went back on gold. What was the outcome? The outcome was, that we had, the'
p2683
aS'British had very high unemployment, they went to over 11 percent employment in'
p2684
aS'1921. They then had extremely high unemployment all through the roaring 20s when'
p2685
aS'everybody else was doing wonderfully. Then of course it got worse. But then even'
p2686
aS'more important to the current situation, they actually were trying to be virtuous. They'
p2687
aS'had 130 percent of debt, sovereign debt, of their government debt relative to GDP after'
p2688
aS'World War I, because it was so costly to fight it, they actually pursued very, very large, a'
p2689
aS'budget surpluses, excluding interest payments.'
p2690
aS'What happened to them? Well, they went 140 percent of GDP in 1919, by the time you'
p2691
aS'got to 1929, they were 170 percent of GDP. So indeed, in this current juncture, where in'
p2692
aS'fact we have to worry about fiscal consolidation, this ended up doing several things. It'
p2693
aS'meant it killed the economy. They actually had deflation. You talked -- Jim Grant talked'
p2694
aS'about deflation as being a good thing during a period of American history. It certainly'
p2695
aS'was not a good thing for the British. And what did you end up with? You ended up with'
p2696
aS'a much more dire fiscal situation, even when there was virtue. A strong dollar policy'
p2697
aS'would be something that would be very damaging to the economy and we do not need'
p2698
aS'a strong dollar policy.'
