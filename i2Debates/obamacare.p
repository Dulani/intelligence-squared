p42
aS'In considering thearguments of our panelists tonight, you might want to think about the effect of this bill oncosts.'
p43
aS'There is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to addressMedicare costs in particular.'
p44
aS'After all, some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in Americaare incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life.'
p45
aS'Some Republicans, by the way,have been quite disingenuous about this, raising the specter of death panels and WorldWar II vets languishing without appropriate care.But another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers, medical malpracticeinsurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that theyfoster.'
p46

p54
aS'Teenagers pay more for auto insurance.Smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth.But for health coverage, most states have mandated that everyone in the community paysthe same.'

p56
aS'Theyoften quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage.'
p57
aS'This bill would forcethem to do so.'

p224
aS'And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin,former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain.'
p225
aS'My partner,Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers.'
p226
aS"And I believehe will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps moreimportantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability."
p227
aS'Let me begin,however, by refuting two arguments.'
p228
aS"First, supporters of Obamacare will say thatRepublicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo.That is simply wrong."
p229
aS'I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcarereform bills than any other member of Congress.'
p230
aS'I wrote a number of patients rights billsin the early debate.But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn andJim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on.'
p231
aS"Andyou would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare.Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the governmentmoney."
p232
aS'And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money.'
p233
aS'Now,Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded.But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense.'
p234
aS'Obamacareinsures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid.'
p235
aS'That willincrease costs.'
p236
aS'It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies andbureaus.'
p237
aS"That's got to increase costs."
p238
aS'And it extends dramatic new mandates over healthinsurance in America.'
p239
aS'And that will increase costs.Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand.The current system is in fact broken.'
p240
aS'As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fixit.'
p241
aS"Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly."
p242
aS'There are too manyuninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot getaffordable coverage.'
p243
aS'I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has --who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition.One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible.'
p244
aS"It's the provision that says youremployee-provided care is tax free."
p245
aS'It costs them no taxes and you no taxes.'
p246
aS'But itpunishes those without employee-provided care.'
p247
aS"Indeed, it tells them, we want you to getinsurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making ita third more expensive."
p248
aS'That is simply outrageous and indefensible.'
p249
aS'And stunningly,Obamacare does not fix that problem.Obamacare is simply the wrong answer.'
p250
aS'First, it addresses symptoms, namely theuninsured, which are too high.But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost.Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up yourpremiums.'
p251
aS'And the experts agree on that point.'
p252
aS"It moves -- and perhaps this is mostimportant--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurancecompanies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding.But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me."
p253
aS'It gives them to the government.What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurancecompanies and give it to people.'
p254
aS'Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and letthem consult with their doctor and make those decisions.'
p255
aS'Republican proposals inCongress do exactly that.'
p256
aS'Why?'
p257
aS"Because if the health insurance is yours, not youremployer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you."
p258
aS"You can makethe changes.You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked."
p259
aS"You can force the insurancecompanies to compete, which they don't do now."
p260
aS"You can hire the plan of your choice.And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you.Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up."
p261
aS'By its terms, Obamacareinstitutes lots of mandates.'
p262
aS'One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turneddown.'
p263
aS'That will increase cost.'
p264
aS'One is modified community rating.'
p265
aS'That will increasecosts.'
p266
aS'And a third is an array of new benefit mandates.'
p267
aS'All of those will increase costs.Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every statewhere they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically.'
p268
aS"InMassachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued togo up at a rate faster than the national average.Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises.The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like yourplan, you can keep it."
p269
aS'Not true.'
p270
aS'He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it.'
p271
aS'Youcan keep him or her.'
p272
aS'Not true.'
p273
aS'And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curvedown.'
p274
aS'None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true.'
p275
aS'TheMedicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose theircurrent coverage.'
p276
aS'Leading experts say few plans will actually survive.'
p277
aS'How could theysurvive?'
p278
aS"They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written.In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare becausetheir small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it."
p279
aS'They willlose their healthcare.'
p280
aS"AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committeethat showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' careand pay the fine.John Deere will lose $150 million a year."
p281
aS'Caterpillar, $100 million a year.'
p282
aS'3M, $90million a year.'
p283
aS'The numbers go on and on.'
p284
aS'Those employers will have no choice to theirstockholders but to drop that care.'
p285
aS"They'll be forced."
p286
aS"And think about their workers.Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor."
p287
aS'We simply haveto do better than that.The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax codeis now.'
p288
aS'It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if youbuy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange.'
p289
aS'And if you join the exchange,you can get a government subsidy.'
p290
aS'But if you have employer-provided care, you cannotjoin the exchange.'
p291
aS"That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care issubsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care."

aS"Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly."
p326
aS'There are too many uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get affordable coverage.'
p327
aS'I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has -- who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition.'
p328
aS'One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible.'
p329
aS"It's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free."
p330
aS'It costs them no taxes and you no taxes.'
p331
aS'But it punishes those without employee-provided care.'
p332
aS"Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it a third more expensive."
p333
aS'That is simply outrageous and indefensible.'
p334
aS'And stunningly, Obamacare does not fix that problem.'
p335
aS'Obamacare is simply the wrong answer.'
p336
aS'First, it addresses symptoms, namely the uninsured, which are too high.'
p337
aS'But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost.'
p338
aS'Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your premiums.'
p339
aS'And the experts agree on that point.'
p340
aS"It moves -- and perhaps this is most important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding."
p341
aS"But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me."
p342
aS'It gives them to the government.'
p343
aS'What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people.'
p344
aS'Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions.'
p345
aS'Republican proposals in Congress do exactly that.'
p346
aS'Why?'
p347
aS"Because if the health insurance is yours, not your employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you."
p348
aS'You can make the changes.'
p349
aS"You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked."
p350
aS"You can force the insurance companies to compete, which they don't do now."
p351
aS'You can hire the plan of your choice.'
p352
aS"And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you."
p353
aS'Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up.'
p354
aS'By its terms, Obamacare institutes lots of mandates.'
p355
aS'One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned down.'
p356
aS'That will increase cost.'
p357
aS'One is modified community rating.'
p358
aS'That will increase costs.'
p359
aS'And a third is an array of new benefit mandates.'
p360
aS'All of those will increase costs.'
p361
aS'Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically.'
p362
aS'In Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average.'
p363
aS"Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises."
p364
aS'The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your plan, you can keep it.'
p365
aS'Not true.'
p366
aS'He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it.'
p367
aS'You can keep him or her.'
p368
aS'Not true.'
p369
aS'And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve down.'
p370
aS'None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true.'
p371
aS'The Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage.'
p372
aS'Leading experts say few plans will actually survive.'
p373
aS'How could they survive?'
p374
aS"They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written."
p375
aS'In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it.'
p376
aS'They will lose their healthcare.'
p377
aS"AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care and pay the fine."
p378
aS'John Deere will lose $150 million a year.'
p379
aS'Caterpillar, $100 million a year.'
p380
aS'3M, $90 million a year.'
p381
aS'The numbers go on and on.'
p382
aS'Those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care.'
p383
aS"They'll be forced."
p384
aS'And think about their workers.'
p385
aS"Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor."
p386
aS'We simply have to do better than that.'
p387
aS'The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code is now.'
p388
aS'It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange.'
p389
aS'And if you join the exchange, you can get a government subsidy.'
p390
aS'But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot join the exchange.'
p391
aS"That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care."

p477
aS'And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the 1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population.'
p478
aS"By the early '90s, it was up to 37 million."
p479
aS"Now it's reached 50 million."
p480
aS'And if we were to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated, the number will go higher.'
p481
aS"Fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose everything they have because of illness."
p482
aS"For years surveys have shown that anxiety about not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans' anxieties."
p483
aS'And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost.'
p484
aS"Still, the majority of Americans, and I guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of those who already have protection."
p485
aS'The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted effort to do that.'
p486
aS"It extends coverage in two ways, by expanding Medicaid for poor people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no more than eight percent of income."
p487
aS'Now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept.'
p488
aS'Massachusetts has a working exchange, The Health Connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties.'
p489
aS"If you move to Massachusetts, you can use The Connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle."
p490
aS'No wonder brokers dont like the idea of the insurance exchange but we dont kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel agents, do we?'
p491
aS'And currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants, 30 cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and marketing costs.'
p492
aS'The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the system.'
p493
aS'In regard to coverage, the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts reforms.'
p494
aS'It does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance.'
p495
aS'The origins of this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals, to a plan that Richard Nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee, with 20 Republican cosponsors, back in 1981 -- 1991, a bill by the way that had an individual mandate in it.'
p496
aS'And substantively, the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation.'
p497
aS'We just dont happen to live in a bipartisan political era.'
p498
aS"Consider the law's moderate responsible approach to financing."
p499
aS'The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand coverage from within the healthcare system.'
p500
aS'We spend enough on healthcare, we just dont allocate it well.'
p501
aS"Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers, and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments, and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans."
p502
aS'The law also imposes a tax on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCains Health Policy Advisor.'
p503
aS'Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will explode the deficit, even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit.'
p504
aS'Now, Jon is my partner in this.'
p505
aS'Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost.'
p506
aS"But while you're listening to the other side, please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at a $3.1 trillion surplus back then."
p507
aS'And Bush came in, cut taxes, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no financing, sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit exploded.'
p508
aS'It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the great recession.'
p509
aS'What happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between 2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress?'
p510
aS'What did they do about health care costs?'
p511
aS'Here are the facts.'
p512
aS'Family health insurance premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a decline of three percent in real median household income.'
p513
aS'Faced with a potential death spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed healthcare reform in the past, the American Medical Association, the hospitals, the for- profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be changed.'
p514
aS'And thats why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it.'
p515
aS'Now just a word on Mr. Shadeggs proposals.'
p516
aS'We have low-regulation states, states that dont regulate the insurance industry.'
p517
aS'His own state of Arizona is one of those states and their costs are just as high as elsewhere.'
p518
aS'Arizona has 20 percent uninsured.'
p519
aS'The high deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and other Republicans favor and put into law havent shown any sign of reducing costs or extending coverage.'
p520
aS'They are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if youre in a high tax bracket, its great to have a health savings account.'
p521
aS'You can put money in the account, dont even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after age 65 without penalty.'
p522
aS'So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy and well-off.'

S'So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our opponents.'
p654
aS'You know, Im going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, youve all realized that what were debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform.'
p655
aS'My own history, Johns history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of which Im unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States.'
p656
aS'Real healthcare reform has two pieces.'
p657
aS'Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare.'
p658
aS'In the end, an insurance system takes the nations health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to.'
p659
aS'The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall healthcare bill.'
p660
aS'And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get.'
p661
aS'At one-sixth of our economy, its one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine.'
p662
aS'And the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades.'
p663
aS'If you look at income per person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades.'
p664
aS'Republicans, Democrats alike.'
p665
aS'It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums.'
p666
aS"And if you don't control costs, you cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about."
p667
aS'I favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform.'
p668
aS'It does not deal with the cost problem.'
p669
aS"Now, I don't need to say so."
p670
aS'Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so.'
p671
aS'The Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections.'
p672
aS'Did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this?'
p673
aS'No, it does not.'
p674
aS"You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of Medicare, not make it more solid."
p675
aS'You can ask Jonathan Gruber.'
p676
aS'Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare.'
p677
aS"He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded."
p678
aS"And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, This isn't about cost reform."
p679
aS'This is health insurance reform.'
p680
aS"There's nothing in it."
p681
aS"Much like Massachusetts, it's just about covering people."
p682
aS"It doesn't control costs."
p683
aS'And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform, Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average.'
p684
aS'And after reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform.'
p685
aS'So we need to get the healthcare reform.'
p686
aS'And without that, we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation.'
p687
aS"Now, I'm a former CBO director."
p688
aS'It is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future.'
p689
aS"I'll spare you the numbers tonight because I like you more than my children."
p690
aS'But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward -- forget re-litigating the past.'
p691
aS'Mr. Starr is good at that.'
p692
aS'But looking forward in the administrations budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after were soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is back at five percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars.'
p693
aS"Nine hundred billion of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing."
p694
aS"We are headed to that magical position where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else."
p695
aS'Along the road, we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation.'
p696
aS'We will no longer be a top- rated borrower.'
p697
aS'This act makes that situation worse, not better.'
p698
aS'It says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent.'
p699
aS"Revenue's not going to grow at eight percent."
p700
aS'The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors and gimmicks.'
p701
aS"And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score."
p702
aS"If you give them handcuffs, they'll come up with any answer that you might want."
p703
aS"So we can't afford this as a nation."
p704
aS"It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs."
p705
aS"It's not really healthcare reform."
p706
aS'You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare.'
p707
aS'One sixth of our economy is underperforming.'
p708
aS'If we care about economic performance, we should repeal Obamacare.'
p709
aS'Forget the mandates, forget the taxes.'
p710
aS'We had a system that was broken to begin with.'
p711
aS'One-sixth of our economy is broken.'
p712
aS'Why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it?'
p713
aS'But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues of fairness.'
p714
aS'Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed.'
p715
aS'There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000.'
p716
aS"One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income."
p717
aS"The other's going to get zip."
p718
aS'That is grotesquely unfair.'
p719
aS"And if any future Congress acts pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond."
p720
aS"They'll give everybody the money."
p721
aS'And my first problem will blow up even worse.'
p722
aS'Terrible idea.'
p723
aS'And for every young person in this audience, this is a disaster.'
p724
aS"Through the individual mandate you'll be obligated to be in the pool."
p725
aS'The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you.'
p726
aS"And at the end of your life, you get to pick up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare."
p727
aS"You'll get it at the front end."
p728
aS"You'll get it at the back end."
p729
aS'It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the United States Congress.'
p730
aS'Should be repealed on those grounds alone.'
p731
aS'There are other sort of detours along the way.'
p732
aS"The insurance companies, that's where all the costs come from."
p733
aS'Oh, my God, there are administrative costs.'
p734
aS'There are profits.'
p735
aS'The top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion.'
p736
aS"That's a lot of money."
p737
aS"I'd like to have it."
p738
aS'The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion.'
p739
aS'So go for it.'
p740
aS'Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits.'
p741
aS"You get about a year and a half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were."
p742
aS"This isn't about insurance companies."
p743
aS'This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs.'
p744
aS'And the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our problems.'
p745
aS'Medicare pays doctors.'
p746
aS'It pays hospitals.'
p747
aS'It pays some insurance companies, and it pays drug companies.'
p748
aS'And it has silos to pay them all.'
p749
aS'And nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary.'
p750
aS'Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care.'
p751
aS'Nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve.'
p752
aS'We should fix that first.'

p889

p890
aS'I do.Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the AffordableCare Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard.'
p891
aS"Now, you listened to this team over here.You've listened to their argument."
p892
aS"And they painted a very dire picture of a program outof control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks."
p893
aS"It's going to leave us all payingtons in insurance premiums."
p894
aS"And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picturebecause I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits ofthe plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existingconditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down,subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now."
p895
aS'People like that.'
p896
aS'They think that is agood idea.'
p897
aS'So they focus on this cost question.'
p898
aS"And, you know, during the healthcaredebate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simplynot in the -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents herewho I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, Idon't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs , but Ithink they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things.So I did two things here."
p899
aS'First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obamahealthcare bill will in fact reduce costs.'
p900
aS'And I want to specifically go through some ofthe arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading.Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money?'
p901
aS"I mean isn't --Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't?"
p902
aS"I don't think it's commonsense."
p903
aS'I look around the world.'
p904
aS'I look at countries like France and Germany andSwitzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better,people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do.'
p905
aS"Now, isthere something about the United States that we're not capable?"
p906
aS"We're not innovativeenough?"
p907
aS"We can't do that?"
p908
aS"I don't think so."
p909
aS'Certainly it is possible, certainly, to getexcellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money.'
p910
aS'So the question is, will this billdo it?'
p911
aS'And I believe it will.Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that.'
p912
aS'It has three basicapproaches.'
p913
aS'One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste.'
p914
aS"A lot of it'scorporate welfare."
p915
aS"Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefitsthrough Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much.They're making too much in profits."
p916
aS"So we say we're going to take some of that back.We're going to take back that corporate welfare.Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask peoplewho have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiestin our society, to pay back a little more in taxes."
p917
aS'And we get money from there.'
p918
aS"Now, Idon't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things willgenerate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan."
p919

p922
aS"Why therichest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had duringthe Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more.But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the mostimportant."
p923
aS'And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care systemworks.'
p924
aS"Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money inour medical care system.Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 differentinsurance companies."
p925
aS"Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A doesn't knowwhat Dr. B is doing to patient C. Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money fortreatments that don't work."
p926
aS"The Obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attackthose, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is notsomething crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the leftand the right."
p927
aS"It's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospitalinfection."
p928
aS"It's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track ofwhat patients are getting as they move through the medical system."
p929
aS"It's about givingfinancial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention,and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe willhelp control healthcare costs."
p930
aS'Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said thesenumbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, commonsense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional BudgetOffice.Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting.'
p931
aS'The CBO -- my readingof the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, "You knowwhat?'
p932
aS'This bill will reduce the deficit.'
p933
aS'It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, itwill reduce it by a lot more afterwards.'
p934
aS'" And by the way, the rate of growth in healthcarespending is going to start to slow down.'
p935
aS'Now, it is true that the CBO, you can say,"Well, the CBO ought to use these rules," or whatever.'
p936
aS'Well, what the CBO rules meanis that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented,and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works.Douglas Holtz-Eakin says, "Well, that never works because we\'ve never seen it happen.'
p937
aS'"Well, you know what?'
p938
aS"It's happened before."
p939
aS'During the late 1990s we tried to controlcosts in Medicare and we did for a while.'
p940
aS'We passed very large cuts to Medicare duringthe Balanced Budget Act.It was the late 1990s, and you know what?'
p941
aS'Those cuts stuck, and we were able to reducethe growth of Medicare from where it wouldve been otherwise.'
p942
aS'Its entirely possible todo this.'
p943
aS'Now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program.'
p944
aS'As mycolleague mentioned, during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they triedto approach healthcare in a different way.'
p945
aS"They said, All right, lets try a differentapproach, and lets have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it."
p946
aS'Well, that didincrease the deficit, and that is the sort of choice were talking about facing here.'
p947
aS'Now,my colleague -- my opponent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed,and he said, Well, John Gruber of MIT says this is not good, or he said, The CMSactuary said this.'
p948
aS'" Well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people -- the list ofexperts who have endorsed this, its not just the Congressional Budget Office, its peoplelike David Cutler, a professor at Harvard University, who won the John Base ClarkMedal for the most accomplished economist under 40.It\'s people like Jonathan Gruber from MIT -- I know he quoted Jonathan Gruber --Jonathan Gruber has said many times he endorses this bill.'
p949
aS"He thinks it's our best shotright now to get healthcare costs under control."
p950
aS"It's people like Mark McClellan, whohasn said that he believes the Affordable Care Act will start to reduce healthcarespending, and why do we care about Mark McClellan?"
p951
aS'Because Mark McClellan ranMedicare in the Bush administration, and its people like the Simpson-BowlesCommission, the bipartisan fiscal commission said, "The cost control in the AffordableCare Act will be affected, and we need if anything to double down on it.'

p961
aS'I want to thank the foundation.'
p962
aS'I want to thank my opponents.'
p963
aS"I want to thank Doug Holtz-Eakin in particular for some of the comments he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control, we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire society."
p964
aS'And you know, I agree with all of that.'
p965
aS'I do.'
p966
aS'Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard.'
p967
aS'Now, you listened to this team over here.'
p968
aS"You've listened to their argument."
p969
aS"And they painted a very dire picture of a program out of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks."
p970
aS"It's going to leave us all paying tons in insurance premiums."
p971
aS"And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture because I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits of the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down, subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now."
p972
aS'People like that.'
p973
aS'They think that is a good idea.'
p974
aS'So they focus on this cost question.'
p975
aS"And, you know, during the healthcare debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply not in the -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, I don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs , but I think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things."
p976
aS'So I did two things here.'
p977
aS'First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs.'
p978
aS'And I want to specifically go through some of the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading.'
p979
aS'Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money?'
p980
aS"I mean isn't -- Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't?"
p981
aS"I don't think it's common sense."
p982
aS'I look around the world.'
p983
aS'I look at countries like France and Germany and Switzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better, people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do.'
p984
aS"Now, is there something about the United States that we're not capable?"
p985
aS"We're not innovative enough?"
p986
aS"We can't do that?"
p987
aS"I don't think so."
p988
aS'Certainly it is possible, certainly, to get excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money.'
p989
aS'So the question is, will this bill do it?'
p990
aS'And I believe it will.'
p991
aS'Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that.'
p992
aS'It has three basic approaches.'
p993
aS'One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste.'
p994
aS"A lot of it's corporate welfare."
p995
aS'Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits through Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much.'
p996
aS"They're making too much in profits."
p997
aS"So we say we're going to take some of that back."
p998
aS"We're going to take back that corporate welfare."
p999
aS'Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes.'
p1000
aS'And we get money from there.'
p1001
aS"Now, I don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan."
p1002
aS'Now, they may not like those ideas.'
p1003
aS"And that's fine."
p1004
aS'And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare.'
p1005
aS"Why the richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during the Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more."
p1006
aS"But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most important."
p1007
aS'And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system works.'
p1008
aS'Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in our medical care system.'
p1009
aS"Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different insurance companies."
