S'Well thank you all. Thank you all for braving the weather to come and for joining us'
p34
aS'tonight. You know I do have in addition to my role on Intelligence Squared a day job'
p35
aS'and its running an insurance company which gets around two percent of its premiums'
p36
aS'from medical insurance. So this debate is not very material to our business but I thought'
p37
aS'I should share that fact with you in the interest of full disclosure. You know, I also want'
p38
aS'to share some of my own insurance expertise as it relates to tonights motion. What'
p39
aS'seems clear to me is that healthcare costs are out of control.'
p40
aS'They amount to around 16 percent of the U.S. economy compared to nine percent in'
p41
aS'other rich countries. Health costs have been a major drag on employment and growth and'
p42
aS'have jeopardized the financial position of the federal government, state governments and'
p43
aS'frankly we have no better health outcomes to show for these costs. In considering the'
p44
aS'arguments of our panelists tonight, you might want to think about the effect of this bill on'
p45
aS'costs. There is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to address'
p46
aS'Medicare costs in particular. After all, some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in America'
p47
aS'are incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life. Some Republicans, by the way,'
p48
aS'have been quite disingenuous about this, raising the specter of death panels and World'
p49
aS'War II vets languishing without appropriate care.'
p50
aS'But another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers, medical malpractice'
p51
aS'insurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that they'
p52
aS'foster. Democrats, traditional allies of the tort bar, have hardly been forthright about this'
p53
aS'aspect of the situation. Another factor is that consumers of health care generally have'
p54
aS'little incentive to control costs. Why should they economize if insurance companies are'
p55
aS'paying? Most insurance covers things you cant budget. Car insurance doesnt cover oil'
p56
aS'changes. Home owners insurance doesnt cover a soiled rug. But when it comes to'
p57
aS'health insurance, we expect coverage of every conceivable medical benefit. Most'
p58
aS'insurance policies are priced to reflect risk. Teenagers pay more for auto insurance.'
p59
aS'Smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth.'
p60
aS'But for health coverage, most states have mandated that everyone in the community pays'
p61
aS'the same. What this means is that healthy young people pay excessive premiums they'
p62
aS'cant well afford in order to subsidize their better-off but more illness prone elders. They'
p63
aS'often quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage. This bill would force'
p64
aS'them to do so. But whether requiring someone to purchase something they dont want is'
p65
aS'even constitutional will surely be touched on in tonights debate. So in considering the'
p66
aS'arguments youll hear this evening, I encourage you to listen with the following kinds of'
p67
aS'questions in mind. Does the bill address unproductive and undignified end-of-life care?'
p68
aS'Does it rein in tort lawyers to discourage defensive medicine? Does it encourage us as'
p69
aS'consumers to care about what we spend?'
p70
aS'Does it provide appropriate incentives for healthy life styles and preventive care? These'
p71
aS'are not rhetorical questions. But theyre very complex just like the bill were discussing.'
p72
aS'We have a stellar roster of panelists to help illuminate these issues and its now my'
p73
aS'pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator, John Donvan. Thank you'
p74
aS'very much.'

p96
aS'a congressman, presidential advisers, and a man who has written more about the topic'

p98
aS'And in this debate, we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience. You'

aS'Our motion is "Repeal Obamacare." And if you agree with this motion, push number'

p151
aS'tonight. I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate. And I want to'
p152
aS'recognize my opponents, one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world'
p153
aS'on this topic. And most of all, I want to thank my debate partner, Douglas Holtz-Eakin,'
p154
aS'former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain. My partner,'
p155
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy, and he will focus on the numbers. And I believe'
p156
aS"he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both won't work and perhaps more"
p157
aS"importantly, will put a critical strain on our nation's fiscal stability. Let me begin,"
p158
aS'however, by refuting two arguments. First, supporters of Obamacare will say that'
p159
aS"Republicans simply don't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo."
p160
aS'That is simply wrong. I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare'
p161
aS'reform bills than any other member of Congress. I wrote a number of patients rights bills'
p162
aS'in the early debate.'
p163
aS'But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and'
p164
aS'Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on. And'
p165
aS"you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation's healthcare."
p166
aS'Second, supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government'
p167
aS'money. And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money. Now,'
p168
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded.'
p169
aS'But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense. Obamacare'
p170
aS'insures roughly 32 million additional Americans, most through Medicaid. That will'
p171
aS'increase costs. It creates a massive new bureaucracy, some 150 plus agencies and'
p172
aS"bureaus. That's got to increase costs. And it extends dramatic new mandates over health"
p173
aS'insurance in America. And that will increase costs.'
p174
aS'Now, let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand.'
p175
aS'The current system is in fact broken. As I said, I have written numerous bills to try to fix'
p176
aS"it. Costs are way too high, and they're going up too quickly. There are too many"
p177
aS'uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and cannot get'
p178
aS'affordable coverage. I have a pre-existing condition, and I have an older sister who has --'
p179
aS'who is a breast cancer survivor, probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition.'
p180
aS"One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible. It's the provision that says your"
p181
aS'employee-provided care is tax free. It costs them no taxes and you no taxes. But it'
p182
aS'punishes those without employee-provided care. Indeed, it tells them, we want you to get'
p183
aS"insurance so much we're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars, making it"
p184
aS'a third more expensive. That is simply outrageous and indefensible. And stunningly,'
p185
aS'Obamacare does not fix that problem.'
p186
aS'Obamacare is simply the wrong answer. First, it addresses symptoms, namely the'
p187
aS'uninsured, which are too high.'
p188
aS'But it does not address, I do not believe appropriately, certainly not with incentives, cost.'
p189
aS'Second, it will not only increase the cost to the government, but it will drive up your'
p190
aS'premiums. And the experts agree on that point. It moves -- and perhaps this is most'
p191
aS'important--healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance'
p192
aS"companies they hire, and they're making lousy decisions, and they shouldn't be deciding."
p193
aS"But it doesn't give those decisions to you and me. It gives them to the government."
p194
aS'What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance'
p195
aS'companies and give it to people. Give it to patients, individuals and their families, and let'
p196
aS'them consult with their doctor and make those decisions. Republican proposals in'
p197
aS'Congress do exactly that. Why? Because if the health insurance is yours, not your'
p198
aS"employer's and not the government's, it's personal, and it belongs to you. You can make"
p199
aS'the changes.'
p200
aS"You aren't trapped in a plan your employer picked. You can force the insurance"
p201
aS"companies to compete, which they don't do now. You can hire the plan of your choice."
p202
aS"And because it's yours, you can fire it, meaning you can hold it accountable to you."
p203
aS'Briefly, let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up. By its terms, Obamacare'
p204
aS'institutes lots of mandates. One is guaranteed issue, meaning nobody can be turned'
p205
aS'down. That will increase cost. One is modified community rating. That will increase'
p206
aS'costs. And a third is an array of new benefit mandates. All of those will increase costs.'
p207
aS'Indeed, in every state, with guaranteed issue and community rating, and in every state'
p208
aS'where they mandated more and more benefits, costs have gone up dramatically. In'
p209
aS'Massachusetts, after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare, costs have continued to'
p210
aS'go up at a rate faster than the national average.'
p211
aS"Let me touch on some of Obamacare's broken promises."
p212
aS'The president told us over and over, and quite frankly, over again, that if you like your'
p213
aS'plan, you can keep it. Not true. He said if you like your doctor, you can keep it. You'
p214
aS'can keep him or her. Not true. And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve'
p215
aS'down. None of those promises, as we examine the plan, turn out to be true. The'
p216
aS'Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their'
p217
aS'current coverage. Leading experts say few plans will actually survive. How could they'
p218
aS"survive? They have to meet benefit mandates that haven't even yet been written."
p219
aS'In fact, thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because'
p220
aS'their small employer or large employer cannot afford to continue to offer it. They will'
p221
aS'lose their healthcare. AT&T, a study was done and provided to the commerce committee'
p222
aS"that showed AT&T will save $2 billion, $2 billion if they cancel their employees' care"
p223
aS'and pay the fine.'
p224
aS'John Deere will lose $150 million a year. Caterpillar, $100 million a year. 3M, $90'
p225
aS'million a year. The numbers go on and on. Those employers will have no choice to their'
p226
aS"stockholders but to drop that care. They'll be forced. And think about their workers."
p227
aS"Their workers will lose their current plan, and they'll lose their doctor. We simply have"
p228
aS'to do better than that.'
p229
aS'The new, indeed, one provision of the law is outrageously unfair, as unfair as the tax code'
p230
aS'is now. It provides, in the new healthcare exchanges, that if you are uninsured, or if you'
p231
aS'buy in the individual market, you can enjoin the exchange. And if you join the exchange,'
p232
aS'you can get a government subsidy. But if you have employer-provided care, you cannot'
p233
aS"join the exchange. That simply isn't fair because it means the cost of your care is"
p234
aS'subsidized, some with the exact same income cannot get subsidized care.'

p305
aS'We should uphold the Affordable Care Act because it is morally the right thing to do and'
p306
aS'it is in our common interest. And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the'
p307
aS'1970s, the official number for the uninsured was 26 million, 12 percent of the population.'
p308
aS"By the early '90s, it was up to 37 million. Now it's reached 50 million. And if we were"
p309
aS'to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated, the number will go higher.'
p310
aS"Fifty million, that's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating, who may lose"
p311
aS'everything they have because of illness. For years surveys have shown that anxiety about'
p312
aS"not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans' anxieties."
p313
aS'And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich'
p314
aS'democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost. Still, the majority of'
p315
aS"Americans, and I guess most of the people here tonight, do have insurance, and it's tricky"
p316
aS'to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of'
p317
aS'those who already have protection. The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted'
p318
aS'effort to do that. It extends coverage in two ways, by expanding Medicaid for poor'
p319
aS"people who've been cut out of that program, and by creating insurance exchanges where"
p320
aS'other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of'
p321
aS'rules that, for example, prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions, and'
p322
aS'where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no'
p323
aS'more than eight percent of income.'
p324
aS'Now, the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept. Massachusetts has a'
p325
aS'working exchange, The Health Connector, adopted as part of the reforms introduced by'
p326
aS'Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties. If you move to'
p327
aS"Massachusetts, you can use The Connector's website and, in half an hour, sign up for an"
p328
aS"insurance plan, no broker's fees, no hassle. No wonder brokers dont like the idea of the"
p329
aS'insurance exchange but we dont kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel'
p330
aS'agents, do we? And currently, if you buy coverage individually or through a small'
p331
aS'business, and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants, 30'
p332
aS'cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and'
p333
aS'marketing costs. The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the'
p334
aS'system. In regard to coverage, the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts'
p335
aS'reforms.'
p336
aS'It does a lot more on cost containment, and far from being a government takeover, the'
p337
aS'program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance. The origins of'
p338
aS'this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals, to a plan that Richard'
p339
aS'Nixon proposed in 1974, and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee, with 20'
p340
aS'Republican cosponsors, back in 1981 -- 1991, a bill by the way that had an individual'
p341
aS'mandate in it. And substantively, the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation. We'
p342
aS"just dont happen to live in a bipartisan political era. Consider the law's moderate"
p343
aS'responsible approach to financing. The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand'
p344
aS'coverage from within the healthcare system. We spend enough on healthcare, we just'
p345
aS'dont allocate it well.'
p346
aS'Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers,'
p347
aS"and since the law's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits, it claws back"
p348
aS'some of the revenue, for example, by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments,'
p349
aS'and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans. The law also imposes a tax'
p350
aS'on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because'
p351
aS'he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCains'
p352
aS'Health Policy Advisor. Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will'
p353
aS'explode the deficit, even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit. Now, Jon is'
p354
aS"my partner in this. Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost. But while you're listening"
p355
aS'to the other side, please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at'
p356
aS'a $3.1 trillion surplus back then.'
p357
aS'And Bush came in, cut taxes, passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no'
p358
aS'financing, sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and, of course, the deficit'
p359
aS'exploded. It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the'
p360
aS'great recession. What happened to health care costs in that period, in the years between'
p361
aS'2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress?'
p362
aS'What did they do about health care costs? Here are the facts. Family health insurance'
p363
aS'premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a'
p364
aS'decline of three percent in real median household income. Faced with a potential death'
p365
aS'spiral in the individual and small group markets, many of the interest groups that opposed'
p366
aS'healthcare reform in the past, the American Medical Association, the hospitals, the for-'
p367
aS'profit hospitals, too, even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be'
p368
aS'changed.'
p369
aS'And thats why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but'
p370
aS'because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it.'
p371
aS'Now just a word on Mr. Shadeggs proposals. We have low-regulation states, states that'
p372
aS'dont regulate the insurance industry. His own state of Arizona is one of those states and'
p373
aS'their costs are just as high as elsewhere. Arizona has 20 percent uninsured. The high'
p374
aS'deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and'
p375
aS'other Republicans favor and put into law havent shown any sign of reducing costs or'
p376
aS'extending coverage. They are, however, a great tax shelter and in fact if youre in a high'
p377
aS'tax bracket, its great to have a health savings account.'
p378
aS'You can put money in the account, dont even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after'
p379
aS'age 65 without penalty. So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy'
p380
aS'and well-off. They just dont happen to do much for the low-income workers and the'
p381
aS'others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare.'

aS'We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. Im'
p406
aS'John Donvan of ABC News. We have four debaters, two teams of two, who are fighting'
p407
aS'it out over this motion, Repeal Obamacare. You have heard from the first two debaters'
p408
aS'and now on to the third. To argue for the motion, to argue for the repeal of Obamacare,'
p409
aS'Id like to introduce Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is president of the American Action'
p410
aS'Forum. He was with the McCain campaign as an adviser and in his critiques of the'
p411
aS'Obama health plan, came up with the telling phrase, fantasy in, fantasy out.'
p412
aS'I believe thats yours. You own that. You also --'
p413
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin:'
p414
aS'Not very profitable but I own it.'
p415
aS'Yes. I also learned through Google another delicious fact -- you were a good sport about'
p416
aS'it -- but after leaving the McCain campaign, you couldnt get health insurance for some'
p417
aS'time.'
p418
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin:'
p419
aS'Not exactly right but I have a pre-existing condition. Actually, I have two kidneys on my'
p420
aS'left side from some extensive work before the 21st Century and I was left on COBRA'
p421
aS'coverage and the solution, of course, is to start your own employer so I started a think'
p422
aS'tank to get insurance.'
p423
aS'So youre covered.'
p424
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin:'
p425
aS'I am covered.'
p426
aS'You took it the hard way. Ladies and gentlemen, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Thank you.'
p427
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin:'
p428
aS'So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our'
p429
aS'opponents. You know, Im going to ask you to support the motion but in the end, youve'
p430
aS'all realized that what were debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the'
p431
aS'United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform.'
p432
aS'My own history, Johns history, probably the histories on the other side of the table of'
p433
aS'which Im unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States.'
p434
aS'Real healthcare reform has two pieces. Number one, it extends healthcare coverage to'
p435
aS'Americans, gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts'
p436
aS'around the cost of your healthcare. In the end, an insurance system takes the nations'
p437
aS'health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost, moving it from some'
p438
aS'people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others'
p439
aS'who may be able to. The second piece, the piece that drives everything, is the overall'
p440
aS'healthcare bill. And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and'
p441
aS'certainly far too large for what we get. At one-sixth of our economy, its one of the most'
p442
aS'inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine. And the key fact to remember in'
p443
aS'thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades. If you look at income per'
p444
aS'person in the United States and healthcare spending per person, the resources versus the'
p445
aS'costs, costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for'
p446
aS'four decades.'
p447
aS'Republicans, Democrats alike. It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that'
p448
aS"ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums. And if you don't control costs, you"
p449
aS'cannot control insurance premiums, and you cannot deal with extending coverage to'
p450
aS'Americans, which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about. I favor repeal'
p451
aS'because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform. It does not deal with the cost'
p452
aS'problem.'
p453
aS"Now, I don't need to say so. Many people, far more qualified than I, have said so. The"
p454
aS'Congressional Budget Office, in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act, put'
p455
aS'out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections. Did health'
p456
aS'spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this? No, it does not.'
p457
aS"You can look at the CMS actuary, the administration, the Obama administration's own"
p458
aS'chief actuary, Richard Foster, who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise'
p459
aS'national healthcare spending, not lower it, and will actually endanger the future of'
p460
aS'Medicare, not make it more solid.'
p461
aS'You can ask Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare.'
p462
aS"He's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded."
p463
aS"And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, he says, This isn't"
p464
aS"about cost reform. This is health insurance reform. There's nothing in it. Much like"
p465
aS"Massachusetts, it's just about covering people. It doesn't control costs."
p466
aS'And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where, prior to reform,'
p467
aS'Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average. And after'
p468
aS'reform, they were at 30 percent higher than the national average, no improvement in the'
p469
aS'fundamental requirement of healthcare reform.'
p470
aS'So we need to get the healthcare reform. And without that, we will never control the'
p471
aS'budgetary costs that threaten our nation.'
p472
aS"Now, I'm a former CBO director. It is my obligation to stand up in public and say"
p473
aS"apocalyptic things about the budgetary future. I'll spare you the numbers tonight because"
p474
aS'I like you more than my children. But the bottom line is this nation, looking forward --'
p475
aS'forget re-litigating the past. Mr. Starr is good at that. But looking forward in the'
p476
aS'administrations budget 10 years from now, after the financial crisis is in memory, after'
p477
aS'were soon to be out of Iraq, out of Iran, after the economy is back at five'
p478
aS'percent unemployment, we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars. Nine hundred billion'
p479
aS"of it's to pay interest on previous borrowing. We are headed to that magical position"
p480
aS"where we're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else. Along the road, we"
p481
aS'will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation. We will no longer be a top-'
p482
aS'rated borrower.'
p483
aS'This act makes that situation worse, not better. It says that two new open-ended'
p484
aS'entitlement programs that will grow, according to CBO, at eight percent a year, as far as'
p485
aS"the eye can see, the economy is not going to grow at eight percent. Revenue's not going"
p486
aS'to grow at eight percent.'
p487
aS'The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke, mirrors'
p488
aS"and gimmicks. And that's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with, in which the"
p489
aS"CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score. If you give them handcuffs, they'll come"
p490
aS'up with any answer that you might want.'
p491
aS"So we can't afford this as a nation. It is dangerous because it doesn't control costs. It's"
p492
aS'not really healthcare reform. You need to vote for healthcare reform, not Obamacare.'
p493
aS'One sixth of our economy is underperforming. If we care about economic performance,'
p494
aS'we should repeal Obamacare. Forget the mandates, forget the taxes. We had a system'
p495
aS'that was broken to begin with. One-sixth of our economy is broken. Why not fix it'
p496
aS'instead of writing checks and papering over it?'
p497
aS'But you hear some other arguments from the other side, the popular ones, now, the issues'
p498
aS'of fairness. Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever'
p499
aS'passed. There are the inequities between two people similarly situated, making $70,000.'
p500
aS"One's going to get $7,000 in federal subsidies, 10 percent of their income. The other's"
p501
aS'going to get zip. That is grotesquely unfair. And if any future Congress acts'
p502
aS" pass one, it'll get solved in a nanosecond. They'll give everybody the"
p503
aS'money. And my first problem will blow up even worse. Terrible idea. And for every'
p504
aS"young person in this audience, this is a disaster. Through the individual mandate you'll be"
p505
aS'obligated to be in the pool. The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills'
p506
aS'of people who are older and sicker than you. And at the end of your life, you get to pick'
p507
aS"up the debt that's been incurred through Obamacare. You'll get it at the front end. You'll"
p508
aS'get it at the back end. It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever'
p509
aS'been scripted by the United States Congress. Should be repealed on those grounds alone.'
p510
aS"There are other sort of detours along the way. The insurance companies, that's where all"
p511
aS'the costs come from. Oh, my God, there are administrative costs. There are profits. The'
p512
aS"top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $260 billion. That's a lot of money. I'd like to"
p513
aS'have it. The cost growth problem every year is $175 billion. So go for it.'
p514
aS'Nationalize the insurance companies, confiscate their profits. You get about a year and a'
p515
aS"half's worth of relief, and we're right back where we were. This isn't about insurance"
p516
aS'companies. This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we'
p517
aS'coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs. And the greatest'
p518
aS'missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare, which is at the root of our'
p519
aS'problems. Medicare pays doctors. It pays hospitals. It pays some insurance companies,'
p520
aS'and it pays drug companies. And it has silos to pay them all. And nowhere in there can'
p521
aS'you find a beneficiary. Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care. Nowhere in'
p522
aS'there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve. We should fix that first. We should'
p523
aS'repeal this now. Thank you.'
p524
aS'Thank you, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Our motion, "Repeal Obamacare" and our final'
p525
aS'speaker in opening statements to speak against the motion, Jonathan Cohn who is a senior'
p526
aS'editor at the New Republic.'
p527
aS"He wrote a book called Sick: The Untold Story of America's Healthcare Crisis, which"
p528
aS'in some ways explains his evolution from pure journalist into advocate with these scores'
p529
aS'and scores of stories of people in dire straits that he reported and is very passionate about.'
p530
aS'You also had a blog throughout the debate called The Treatment. And you signed off,'
p531
aS'after the legislation passed, saying, and I quote you, "The debate has ended." So why are'
p532
aS'we here?'

p563
aS'he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country, the importance of trying to get'
p564
aS"healthcare costs under control because if we don't get healthcare costs under control,"
p565
aS"we're not only going to bankrupt our government, we're going to bankrupt our entire"
p566
aS'society. And you know, I agree with all of that. I do.'
p567
aS'Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine, is that I happen to think the Affordable'
p568
aS'Care Act, Obamacare, helps us in that regard. Now, you listened to this team over here.'
p569
aS"You've listened to their argument. And they painted a very dire picture of a program out"
p570
aS"of control that's going to cost more than anybody thinks. It's going to leave us all paying"
p571
aS'tons in insurance premiums. And you know, they have to paint an apocalyptic picture'
p572
aS'because I think the honest truth is most of us, when we hear that -- about the benefits of'
p573
aS"the plan, that we'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing"
p574
aS'conditions, the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down,'
p575
aS"subsidies for people who can't buy coverage now. People like that. They think that is a"
p576
aS'good idea. So they focus on this cost question. And, you know, during the healthcare'
p577
aS'debate, we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply'
p578
aS'not in the -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here'
p579
aS"who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it, I think they're giving you, well, I"
p580
aS"don't want so say they're making things up out of whole costs , but I"
p581
aS"think they're giving you a slightly, let's say, one-sided picture of things."
p582
aS'So I did two things here. First, I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama'
p583
aS'healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs. And I want to specifically go through some of'
p584
aS'the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading.'
p585
aS"Now, why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money? I mean isn't --"
p586
aS"Congressman Shadegg said, isn't it common sense that it won't? I don't think it's common"
p587
aS'sense. I look around the world. I look at countries like France and Germany and'
p588
aS'Switzerland and Japan, countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better,'
p589
aS'people who have easier access to healthcare, and yet they spend less than we do. Now, is'
p590
aS"there something about the United States that we're not capable? We're not innovative"
p591
aS"enough? We can't do that? I don't think so. Certainly it is possible, certainly, to get"
p592
aS'excellent healthcare, cover everybody and save money. So the question is, will this bill'
p593
aS'do it? And I believe it will.'
p594
aS'Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that. It has three basic'
p595
aS"approaches. One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare, the waste. A lot of it's"
p596
aS'corporate welfare. Right now, for example, insurance companies that provide benefits'
p597
aS'through Medicare, study after study has shown that we pay them too much.'
p598
aS"They're making too much in profits. So we say we're going to take some of that back."
p599
aS"We're going to take back that corporate welfare."
p600
aS'Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people'
p601
aS'who have benefited the most from our economy, the people who are the very wealthiest'
p602
aS'in our society, to pay back a little more in taxes. And we get money from there. Now, I'
p603
aS"don't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will"
p604
aS'generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan. Now, they may not like those'
p605
aS"ideas. And that's fine. And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us"
p606
aS'why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare. Why the'
p607
aS'richest people in this country, who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during'
p608
aS"the Clinton administration, can't afford to pay a little more."
p609
aS"But it's the third part of healthcare reform, the third part of cost control that's the most"
p610
aS'important. And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system'
p611
aS'works. Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in'
p612
aS'our medical care system.'
p613
aS"Some of this is administrative waste because everyone's dealing with 10 different"
p614
aS"insurance companies. Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A doesn't know"
p615
aS'what Dr. B is doing to patient C. Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for'
p616
aS"treatments that don't work. The Obama healthcare bill, what it does is it tries to attack"
p617
aS"those, and it tries dozens of different approaches, and it's not a liberal takeover, it is not"
p618
aS"something crazy extremists cooked up on one side, it's actually the best ideas of the left"
p619
aS"and the right. It's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital"
p620
aS"infection. It's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of"
p621
aS"what patients are getting as they move through the medical system. It's about giving"
p622
aS'financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention,'
p623
aS'and efforts like this that together, the smartest people have stated this, all believe will'
p624
aS'help control healthcare costs. Now, Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said these'
p625
aS'numbers are crazy, that of course this is going to explode the deficit, and again, common'
p626
aS'sense, well, the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional Budget'
p627
aS'Office.'
p628
aS'Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting. The CBO -- my reading'
p629
aS'of the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said, "You know'
p630
aS'what? This bill will reduce the deficit. It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years, it'
p631
aS'will reduce it by a lot more afterwards." And by the way, the rate of growth in healthcare'
p632
aS'spending is going to start to slow down. Now, it is true that the CBO, you can say,'
p633
aS'"Well, the CBO ought to use these rules," or whatever. Well, what the CBO rules mean'
p634
aS'is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented,'
p635
aS'and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works.'
p636
aS'Douglas Holtz-Eakin says, "Well, that never works because we\'ve never seen it happen."'
p637
aS"Well, you know what? It's happened before. During the late 1990s we tried to control"
p638
aS'costs in Medicare and we did for a while. We passed very large cuts to Medicare during'
p639
aS'the Balanced Budget Act.'
p640
aS'It was the late 1990s, and you know what? Those cuts stuck, and we were able to reduce'
p641
aS'the growth of Medicare from where it wouldve been otherwise. Its entirely possible to'
p642
aS'do this. Now, in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program. As my'
p643
aS'colleague mentioned, during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they tried'
p644
aS'to approach healthcare in a different way. They said, All right, lets try a different'
p645
aS"approach, and lets have a healthcare bill, let's not pay the cost for it. Well, that did"
p646
aS'increase the deficit, and that is the sort of choice were talking about facing here. Now,'
p647
aS'my colleague -- my opponent, Mr. Holtz-Eakin, cited a number of authorities he believed,'
p648
aS'and he said, Well, John Gruber of MIT says this is not good, or he said, The CMS'
p649
aS'actuary said this." Well, in fact, if you look at the written record, the people -- the list of'
p650
aS'experts who have endorsed this, its not just the Congressional Budget Office, its people'
p651
aS'like David Cutler, a professor at Harvard University, who won the John Base Clark'
p652
aS'Medal for the most accomplished economist under 40.'
p653

p1194
aS'Seventy percent of the healthcare costs in any year are concentrated in 10 percent of the'

p1196
aS'and to look for the 50 percent of people who actually account for only three percent of'

aS'the costs. And when you have this market where supposedly everybody has individual'

p1199
aS'and avoid the sick people. They will do everything in their -- it is the best business model'
p1200
aS"for them. Rather than try to control healthcare costs, it's just to avoid sick people. The"
p1201
aS'way the exchanges work is that if you want to sell insurance in the exchange, you have to'
p1202
aS'agree to take anybody. Thats the bargain. And what the exchange does, so the people'
p1203
aS'pay in on a community rated basis, but the insurance companies get paid according to the'
p1204
aS'risk of the population they enroll. So if they enroll an older population, if they enroll a'

p2323
aS"millions who don't have it. To Europeans across the political spectrum, it's unthinkable"
p2324
aS'to withhold health insurance, just as we would regard it as unthinkable to deny an'
p2325

p2326
aS"medical care, don't become uninsurable when they get ill. They don't get locked into a"

p2328

p2416
aS'hundreds like it is where this all starts for me. This is a problem we have had in this'

p2419
aS'President Obama won, the Democrats got in and this was job number one. They reached'

aS'out to the Republicans. They took ideas that Republicans had for years claimed as their'
p2421
aS'own and said, "All right, well meet you halfway, and well try -- we will come up with a'
p2422
aS'plan that builds on your ideas and our ideas and well work together." And the'
p2423
aS'Republicans walked away, and they said, "Fine. We have to go it alone, well go it'
p2424
aS'alone." But they kept the same ideas, they took the best from left and right, and what did'
p2425
aS'they get? Its not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that will mean 30 million people have'
p2426
aS'health insurance.'
p2427
aS'It will mean that the insurance people have will be good insurance that will cover what'

p2429
aS'never tells you this part of his plan, but the credit he would offer people isnt enough to'
