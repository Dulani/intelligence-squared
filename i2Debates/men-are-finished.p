S'Welcome. Well, "Men are finished," mmm. I for one hope not. But there does seem to'
p34
aS'be a lot of evidence that we are. Traditional male attributes like competitiveness,'
p35
aS'aggression and risk taking are discouraged in -- in classrooms and derided in popular'
p36
aS'culture. As a society, our values seem to be shifting toward the traditional feminine'
p37
aS'virtues of empathy, cooperation, emotional intelligence. Increasingly, men are not'
p38
aS'taking the responsibility for parenting, and women are proceeding on their own.'
p39
aS'At the top of the cognitive pyramid, women are now a majority in our universities,'
p40
aS'graduate schools of law, business and medicine. And at the bottom, the high-paid jobs'
p41
aS'men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in'
p42
aS'factories have fallen victim to globalization. Men are overrepresented in prisons and in'
p43
aS'the ranks of the unemployed. And underrepresented in higher education. Project these'
p44
aS'trends forward for a couple of decade, and the future looks pretty bleak for men.'
p45
aS'On the other hand, and there always is another hand in our debates, men still hold'
p46
aS'positions of overwhelming dominance as CEOs of our largest companies and financial'
p47
aS'institutions, as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes, the Microsofts,'
p48
aS'Oracles, Googles, Facebooks, as top elected officials in both the federal and state'
p49
aS'governments, as the most influential artists and writers, as scientists with'
p50
aS'breakthroughs worthy of Nobel prizes and on and on.'
p51
aS'So where do you come out tonight on this question, are men finished? The answer may'
p52
aS"depend on how you interpret the question. What we meant but couldn't say in three"
p53
aS"provocative words, is whether we're at a tipping point where women are likely to"
p54
aS'achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past, or'
p55
aS'whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant,'
p56
aS'perhaps, but hardly fundamental. Well, we have an extraordinary group of panelists to'
p57
aS"help you make that decision, and it's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them,"
p58
aS'and to our moderator, John Donvan.'

p81
aS'Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University. Men are finished. Two'
p82
aS'teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides, one for it and one against it.'
p83
aS'These teams include Dan Abrams, my colleague at ABC News, where he is chief legal'
p84

p93
aS'Now, this is the debate. It is a contest. One team will win, and one team will lose in this'
p94
aS'joust of ideas. And you, our live audience here at the Skirball Center will be functioning'

aS'as our judges. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been asked to vote'
p96
aS'twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards to register where you stand on'
p97
aS'this motion, "Men are finished." And the team that has changed the most of your minds'
p98
aS"in the course of the debate will be declared our winner. So let's go to your preliminary"
p99
aS'vote.'
p100
aS'If you go to these key pads at your seat, they have numbers one through three along the'
p101
aS'top row. If you agree with the motion, "Men are finished," push number one. If you'
p102
aS'disagree, push number two. And if you are undecided, push number three. And if you'
p103
aS"feel that you've made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in your last vote."
p104
aS"And what we're going to do is tabulate those. And at the end of the debate after the"
p105
aS"second vote, I'll present both numbers. And reminding you again the team that has"
p106

p152
aS'Just kidding. Before I dive in, I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition.'
p153
aS'What do we mean by men are finished?'
p154
aS"We'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall, as the sign that points to an"
p155
aS"inevitable future. What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate, we don't have"

p157
aS'Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any'
p158
aS'minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a'
p159
aS'while as sex slaves. That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard. Maybe it'
p160
aS'sounds good to you guys.'
p161
aS'But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men'
p162
aS'dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success'
p163
aS'is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to.'
p164
aS'We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics'
p165
aS"between men and women are shifting very radically. I'll start with the fundamentals. In"
p166
aS'2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force. This is kind'
p167
aS'of an amazing fact.'
p168
aS'As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological'
p169
aS'phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of'
p170
aS'you might remember. Now she is the majority of the work force. If you look back at'
p171
aS'your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting,'
p172
aS'even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those'
p173
aS'schools. And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American'
p174
aS'managers.'
p175
aS"Now, how are men doing these days? They're doing very, very badly. The annual"
p176
aS'income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going.'
p177
aS"Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever"
p178
aS'existed.'
p179
aS'When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at'
p180
aS'night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the'
p181
aS'many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of'
p182
aS'those things. What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as'
p183
aS'having vast social consequences.'
p184
aS'Now, why is this happening? The very simple answer is college. Most economists agree'
p185
aS"that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple. It's just a college degree."
p186
aS'But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees'
p187
aS'than men. For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same.'
p188
aS"So why are women getting more college degrees? It's not that women are smarter"
p189
aS"because they're not smarter. These days, men and women test about the same on"
p190
aS'standardized tests for both math and English. But women have something. Some'
p191
aS'sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social'
p192
aS"intelligence. It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which"
p193
aS'women just seem to have in greater abundance than men. And this is a very new thing.'
p194
aS'Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in'
p195
aS"college. But then they're going to say so what? Women are goody goodies, then they"
p196
aS'go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else. But this is, of'
p197
aS'course, completely preposterous.'
p198
aS"For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you"
p199
aS'already see the results in the economy. You already see that for women under 30 these'
p200
aS"days are making more money than men under 30. And that's really, really new. Also"
p201
aS'women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something'
p202
aS"that's brand new. And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are"
p203
aS'starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my'
p204
aS'partner is going to talk about later.'
p205
aS'So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the'
p206
aS"culture. We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls"
p207
aS"the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack. And so we see him"
p208
aS"in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials. He's sitting"
p209
aS'around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to'
p210
aS"do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his"
p211
aS'40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up'
p212
aS'from college.'
p213
aS'I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season.'
p214
aS'The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here'
p215
aS'again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work,'
p216
aS'sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and'
p217
aS"they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames. One of the guys in the"
p218
aS'sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon'
p219
aS'his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from'
p220
aS'Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot.'
p221
aS"So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days. Now we're on to my favorite"
p222
aS'subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity.'
p223
aS'Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets. Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases'
p224
aS"because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health."
p225
aS"Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and"
p226
aS"aggression. The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's"
p227
aS'adventurous free loving spirit. These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity. Men are'
p228
aS'fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes. If you look at the back at'
p229
aS"the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an"
p230
aS"orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming"
p231
aS"out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man. These days the men are waxing and"
p232
aS'primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar'
p233
aS'with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner. '
p234
aS"Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about"
p235
aS'how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology'
p236
aS'industry.'
p237
aS"I have a few things to say to that. First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of"
p238
aS"men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are"
p239
aS"incarcerated or having trouble in school. It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful"
p240
aS"of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished. You're also likely to"
p241
aS'hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women'
p242
aS"there are out there at the top. I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on"
p243
aS'and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and'
p244
aS"women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside-"
p245
aS'down overnight. But the writing on the wall is still clear, men are finished, which is why'
p246
aS'you should vote for us.'

p288
aS"running the world but they're not replacing them. Women are flourishing in ways which"
p289
aS'are unprecedented, exciting, glorious. But men have hardly vanished from the limelight.'
p290
aS'I mean, after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns, men are still more likely than'
p291
aS'women to run for political office, start businesses, file patents, write editorials, tell'
p292
aS'jokes. They conduct the orchestras. They direct the great movies. They blow up things.'
p293
aS'Now, I admit blowing up things is problematic. I wish they would do less of it.'
p294
aS'Men commit most acts of wanton violence. But, at the same time, it usually takes other'
p295
aS'men to stop them.'
p296
aS'The males are in decline crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building'
p297
aS'women, happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy. They'
p298
aS'point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators, more social workers,'
p299
aS'veterinarians, dance therapists, teachers.'
p300
aS'The problem is that you cant sustain a network of nurturers and communicators'
p301
aS'without someone paying for it. Youre still going to need ambitious, hard-driven'
p302
aS'innovators, manufacturers, engineers, construction workers, along with police officers,'
p303
aS'firefighters and the military. Now, were told that toughness and assertiveness, those'
p304
aS'are obsolete, fit for another age, not the 21st century. Thats absurd. Its worse than'
p305
aS'absurd. It borders on being ungrateful and even elitist. It ignores the actions and'
p306
aS'virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and'
p307
aS'debate whether men are in decline. It reminds me of a quote by -- well, attributed to'
p308
aS'George Orwell. Orwell allegedly said, We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only'
p309
aS'because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf. Well, the world is still'
p310
aS'dangerous, and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some'
p311
aS'women who are willing to fight and die to protect us.'
p312
aS'Now, Hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid, but she says, quote,'
p313
aS'Mens hold on power in elite circles is loosening. Loosening? Yes, of course. I agree.'
p314
aS'And I welcome it. But its not evidence of a female takeover. I mean, just think about it.'
p315
aS'Women have amazing talents. They can be as dazzling as men when they set their'
p316
aS'minds to it. But the sexes are equal. But they exercise their equality in different ways.'
p317
aS'Consider science and technology. Women now hold a majority of college degrees, and'
p318
aS'they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology, veterinary medicine, biology. Its'
p319
aS'quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these'
p320
aS'fields and, indeed, very exciting to behold.'
p321
aS'Theyre just as competitive as men in those fields, if not more. But those numbers dont'
p322
aS'hold in other fields. Math, technology, engineering -- those are fields where men prevail'
p323
aS'by huge numbers. And give them time, says Hanna. Women have only just begun,'
p324
aS'and that women are in ascendancy. Theyre going to gain momentum. Where is it? I'
p325
aS'see no sign of it. According to a recent study by the Commerce Department, womens'
p326
aS'numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10'
p327
aS'years. I mean, if Hanna were right, these trends -- we would begin to see women taking'
p328
aS'over, or at least showing some progress. We see no progress, very little progress in'
p329
aS'those fields.'
p330
aS'Now, ask yourself, is technology finished? Is engineering finished? Is the military'
p331
aS'finished? Are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a'
p332
aS'roofer, a logger -- are those finished?'
p333
aS'Now, its true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble. And I agree very'
p334
aS'much with Hanna that this is a matter of grave concern. Girls do better than boys in'
p335
aS'school. They get better grades. They score higher on reading and writing tests. Theyre'
p336
aS'more likely to go to college. The reason for girls educational success, theyre'
p337
aS'complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and'
p338
aS'cultural differences. Teenage girls, for example, tend to pay attention better than'
p339
aS'teenage boys. But instead of declaring men finished because of their educational'
p340
aS'deficits, we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys'
p341
aS'and young men, and more conducive to their success.'
p342
aS'Why are we even having this debate about mens demise? The reason is we are living in'
p343
aS'an era you could call WAW, women are wonderful.'
p344
aS'Its a phenomenon thats been identified by some psychologists. And it used to be'
p345
aS'fashionable to celebrate mens superiority over women when women were truly the'
p346
aS'second sex. Fortunately, those chauvinist days are long gone. Today, a new kind of'
p347
aS'reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy, female chauvinism. Magazines, TV shows, yes,'
p348
aS'sitcoms claim, you know, the endless heroics about girl power, "You go, girl," claiming'
p349
aS'that women are better at everything. Women are better leaders, women are better'
p350
aS'communicators, all around better human beings. I saw one-story that said women have'
p351
aS'better orgasms than men. The rules of the WAW game make it impossible for them to --'
p352
aS"to win, because if women do something better than men, that's evidence of their"
p353
aS"superiority. If men outperform women, that's proof of discrimination and the"
p354
aS'continuing male culture.'
p355
aS'What you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the WAW'
p356
aS'phenomenon. The idea that men are finished is crazy.'
p357
aS'Men and women complement each other. We are not separate teams competing for a'
p358
aS"trophy. This is not a zero sum competition. We're dance partners like Fred Astaire and"
p359
aS'Ginger Rogers. Our fates are inextricably tied together. If one is in trouble, so is the'
p360
aS'other. Several years ago the Hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house. They'
p361
aS'wanted to manufacture -- they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls. The girls came'
p362
aS'in, and the boys. The girls played constructively with the dolls. The kids took the dolls'
p363
aS'and played house. The boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof. And the'
p364
aS'Hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation: Boys and girls are different.'

p443
aS'as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority? Did he do it to meet'
p444
aS"women? Did he -- did he do it to pander? You know, it's always frustrating for me when"
p445
aS"I'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book. I did it for both reasons, and it's"
p446
aS'worked incredibly well.'
p447
aS'Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question'
p448
aS'that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, "Man Down," far more attention'
p449
aS"than it ever would have received. I made a case based on evidence and men's rights"
p450
aS'groups and others have attacked me, saying, "He didn\'t use the scientific method in this'
p451
aS'book." Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort. So I separate it into'
p452
aS'two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived'
p453
aS'notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority.'
p454
aS'Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even'
p455
aS'they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women'
p456
aS'handling breakups better than men? I presented evidence. I presented studies,'
p457
aS"research. But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters. So let's"
p458
aS'put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are'
p459
aS"important. Hanna talked about women as students. They'll be better educated. They'll"
p460
aS"navigate tough economies better. They'll be better equipped for the workplace of the"
p461
aS"next generation. But I don't know. What about politics, finance, taking care of the"
p462
aS'planet? These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important'
p463
aS'the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in'
p464
aS'certain areas.'
p465
aS"Let's start with politics. Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the"
p466
aS'percentage of the population. In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent'
p467
aS'of women voted. 58 percent of men. In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the'
p468
aS'ballots, by the way, 66-62. Same thing in midterm elections in 2010. 53 percent of'
p469
aS'those who voted were female.'
p470
aS'But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men. Four out of'
p471
aS'five being elected are men. In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats. And for the'
p472
aS'first time in 30 years, lost House seats. This is true for now. But once the women voters'
p473
aS'and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot'
p474
aS'continue. Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has'
p475
aS'come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress.'
p476
aS'The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004'
p477
aS'women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their'
p478
aS'male counterparts. Women sponsored more bills. They cosponsored many more bills.'
p479
aS'They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues. In addition,'
p480
aS'two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and'
p481
aS'2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative'
p482
aS'process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall.'
p483
aS'And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police'
p484
aS'officers -- women are less corruptible. Two major international studies, one at the'
p485
aS'World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from'
p486
aS"dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey. They took a count of"
p487
aS'corruption levels within the countries. They took a count of culture, religion, education.'
p488
aS'The results were clear.'
p489
aS"The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature. So what the heck's"
p490
aS"going on? Why aren't there more women? I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it"
p491
aS'all. They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders'
p492
aS'and whether they thought men or women were superior. Honesty, overwhelmingly'
p493
aS'women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative,'
p494
aS'overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied. The only one of the eight'
p495
aS'relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness. In that same study,'
p496
aS'though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders.'
p497
aS'Similar results when it came to newscasters. A rigorous study done, male and female'
p498
aS'news casters reading the exact same message. The participants agreed that when it'
p499
aS'came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible. And yet when those same'
p500
aS'people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men.'
p501
aS'There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past'
p502
aS'sexism and assumptions.'
p503
aS"Now, finance. You don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance. 2009 and"
p504
aS'2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, "For Mother\'s'
p505
aS'Day, give her the reins to the portfolio" and "How men\'s overconfidence hurts them as'
p506
aS'investors." Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on'
p507
aS'less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money. Female hedge'
p508
aS'fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to'
p509
aS'hedge fund research by a whopping three percent. Business Week reported that when'
p510
aS'the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for'
p511
aS'men. Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers. Maybe they have to'
p512
aS'work harder to get there. Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game.'
p513
aS'But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves. And all other things'
p514
aS'equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman. Finally, new studies'
p515
aS'show that women are more committed to protecting the planet. They recycle more.'
p516
aS"They're more likely to be green. They eat less meat. They take shorter trips. In part"
p517
aS'because they give and follow better directions than men. They take public'
p518
aS'transportation more. They are also better and safer bus drivers. They save gas by'
p519
aS'speeding less. They make more eco purchases. Heck, God has decided that men are'
p520
aS'finished. Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men.'
p521
aS'So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas? Three reasons: Married'
p522
aS"or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the"
p523
aS'overconfidence of men; and three, sexism. When number one may not ever change for'
p524
aS'certain, number two and three will.'
p525
aS'They must. And then us men are in big trouble.'

p579
aS"Men can't possibly be finished because as all of you know, when men are finished, they"
p580
aS'roll over immediately and go to sleep.'
p581
aS"That's not happening. Clearly men are not rolling over. Now, they will have you believe"

aS'corporations, yes, win elections, and to your point quite sadly, tweet pics of their'

aS"genitalia to complete strangers. That's true. Nothing's changed."
p586
aS'Now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women now'
p587
aS"outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economy"
p588
aS'continues to place greater and greater importance on education. And men are certainly'
p589
aS'falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession,'
p590
aS'nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men, yes. Men make up the largest'
p591
aS'sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the'
p592
aS'majority of people who ought to be in rehab. And as Jeff Foxworthy might have put it,'
p593
aS'very few women say as their last words, "Hey, watch this."'
p594
aS"It's a fact. Testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men"
p595
aS'seven years sooner than women.'
p596
aS'So how can I concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must'
p597
aS"vote against this measure? It's simple. All of the statistics that my opponents will be"
p598
aS'citing tonight are indicative of a trend. Women are beginning to catch up to men. But'
p599
aS'the pace of that progress is inexorably slow. According to the United Nations women'
p600
aS"perform two-thirds of the world's work, but only earn a fraction of the world's income."
p601
aS"Men own 99 percent of the world's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign"
p602
aS"nations. Now, I didn't get through all of Freakonomics, admittedly, but these do not"
p603
aS'seem like winning statistics for that side.'
p604
aS"Obviously, the other 150 million American males out there aren't particularly alarmed"
p605
aS"either. I don't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of"
p606
aS'this debate out there burning their jockstraps.'
p607
aS"Men aren't finished. You have to vote against this motion. Now, what's going on? In"
p608
aS"part it's the biological drive. There is a women's movement for the simple reason that"
p609
aS'women are willing to move together more as a unit. Men are rugged individualists.'
p610
aS'They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for'
p611
aS"directions. So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our"
p612
aS"opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that."
p613
aS'It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action'
p614
aS'oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role. It was'
p615
aS'still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine. Its still men who make up 90'
p616
aS'percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours. It'
p617
aS'was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center. And'
p618
aS'while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, I'
p619
aS'personally am in awe of Rupert Murdochs wife.'
p620
aS'We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership. Even'
p621
aS'women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of'
p622
aS'masculinity. Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black'
p623
aS'leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is.'
p624
aS'Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down'
p625
aS'gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins.'
p626
aS'Yes, women are making enormous gains in education. They now earn the majority of'
p627
aS'graduate and undergraduate degrees. And I feel terrible, just terrible, for Bill Gates and'
p628
aS'Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and'
p629
aS'Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming'
p630
aS'billionaires to finish their homework. Awful. Its so tough. It would have been much'
p631
aS'better --'
p632
aS'It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken'
p633
aS'on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which'
p634
aS'now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex.'
p635
aS'Of course, theres self-made women billionaires -- Oprah, Martha, J.K. Rowling,'
p636
aS'imaginative visions shared worldwide. But its men who flood the patent offices with'
p637
aS'their big ideas. And until a woman invents the next Google or Facebook or iPad or bass-'
p638
aS'o-matic --'
p639
aS'-- the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes.'
p640
aS'So, men are driven to achieve power and influence. Men arent worried about losing'
p641
aS'out to women. Theyre still too focused on not losing out to other men. Thats why men'
p642

aS'thats arguing for the motion, and I think perhaps to you, Hanna Rosin. Your opponents'
p678
aS'are making the case that part of the reason that the notion is afloat, that "Men are'
p679
aS'finished," is because theres an attitude about, theres a sense that women can only be'
p680
aS'doing better if men are doing worse, that this is a zero-sum game. So is it? Is it not'
p681
aS'possible for both sides to do well without this imbalance resulting?'

p689
aS'was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over, then I think we'
p690
aS'agree that men are finished. So the resolution is about male dominance which weve'

S'I urge you to vote against this proposition for three reasons.'
p2852
aS'Number one, its false. Okay, women are not replacing men. Women are not becoming'
p2853
aS'the first sex. Women are becoming partners with men. Men continue to do most of the'
p2854
aS'arduous and dangerous work, and they are the primary risk-takers and innovators.'
p2855
aS'Society is driven by what the classical economist Joseph Schumpeter called the gale of'
p2856
aS'creative destruction. Women can cause such gales, but it has always been a masculine'
p2857
aS'specialty, and there is zero evidence that that is changing.'
p2858
aS'Now as I said in my earlier remarks, men have been doing less well in the classroom, but'
p2859
aS'this does not herald the end of men. Rather, it means that we have to find ways of'
p2860
aS'making our schools more effective for male students. Reason two you should oppose'
p2861
aS'this proposition: Its chauvinistic. As I said, in the old days, we had female supremacy.'
p2862
aS'Its been replaced by this variety of women are wonderful phenomenon.'
p2863
aS'The battle days of male supremacy are now followed by this female chauvinism. So, I'
p2864
aS'believe that an act in favor of this proposition is a vote for chauvinism. Third and most'
p2865
aS'important, the sexes need each other. They complement each other. They have been'
p2866
aS'known to love one another. As Henry Kissinger once said, No one will ever win the war'
p2867
aS'between the sexes. Theres just too much fraternizing with the enemy.'
p2868
aS'Now women and men do not succeed at one anothers expense. Were on the same'
p2869
aS'team. Were co-dependent. That was true on the African Savanna 100,000 years ago. It'
p2870
aS'has been true ever since. Its true in 21st century America. You can certainly find times'
p2871
aS'when one sex has acquitted itself better than the other, but you will never find'
p2872
aS'examples of one sex becoming irrelevant. Such a development is beyond anything in'
p2873
aS'human experience. I urge you to vote in favor of reality. Thank you.'

S'Im going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes. One is from a story called, The'
p2895
aS'Decline of the American Male. Men, this writer says, are endangered species. They'
p2896
aS'are expendable. Another quote: Women have gained in the past century while men'
p2897
aS'have fallen behind. Who is this mystery author? Dave Zinczenko is the mystery author'
p2898
aS'who wrote this story at USA Today in 2009. He keeps saying this is preposterous, this is'
p2899
aS'preposterous. Merely two years ago, he thought that it was true. Now Im going to'
p2900
aS'read you another series of quotes. It is boys who are the second sex. Its a bad time to'
p2901
aS'be a boy in America. The research -- listen to this closely -- commonly cited to support'
p2902
aS'claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors.'
p2903
aS'Who is the mystery author of this article? Christina Hoff Sommers, whos also saying'
p2904
aS'that this is all very preposterous. So, as you can see, its not that preposterous. We can'
p2905
aS'all see the writing on the walls. They keep talking about how men are still running the'
p2906
aS"country. Men are still doing this, men are still doing that. But that's not interesting."
p2907
aS'That just shows a lack of imagination. As we said, this "Men are finished" proposition,'
p2908
aS'you literally have to think of it as graffiti, as the writing on the wall pointing to an'
p2909
aS'inevitable future. All the signs are there.'
p2910
aS'So -- and then the final thing I want to say is, Christina says this is a vote for chauvinism,'
p2911
aS'that "Men are finished" is a vote for chauvinism. Don\'t think of it that way. You\'re'
p2912
aS'actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because I think if we'
p2913
aS'finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need'
p2914
aS'our help, and they might even need some affirmative action, then maybe we would'
p2915
aS'behave the right way, and we would help the men who desperately need our help. So'

p2936
aS'by the way, was arguing for better healthcare for men. There are five offices of'
p2937
aS"women's health in the federal government, zero for men. That was really the context."
p2938
aS'Now, my opponents tonight have outlined some trends that seem to herald the final'
p2939
aS'decent of the American male into a metaphorical trash heap of irrelevance and'
p2940
aS'impotence. They are trying to bury legions of men alive, okay? You have to vote against'
p2941
aS'this measure.'
p2942
aS'Sure, there are some worrisome trends.'
p2943
aS'They went through them, okay? And as we all know once a trend starts, it keeps going'
p2944
aS"on forever. That's why all of our houses are worth so much more today than they were"
p2945
aS'in 2007. Now, in the end, there are two reasons why you must vote against this motion,'
p2946
aS'because they might be wrong, but they might be right. Now, the first point, consider'
p2947
aS'this: Gender equality is something, we can all agree on, as an ideal. But if we are'
p2948
aS'approaching gender equality, why are there fewer women in government today than'
p2949
aS'there were ten years ago? Why is it so much easier for men to hold onto their gun'
p2950
aS"rights than it is for women to hold onto their reproductive rights? Not only aren't men"
p2951
aS"finished, but women haven't even begun. Let's at least get to the point where the game"
p2952
aS"is tied before we start writing all the men off. Let's imagine, though, that the trend"
p2953
aS'toward greater female political social and economic power continues unabated.'
p2954
aS"Highly unlikely because the great recession started with men and now it's starting to hit"
p2955
aS'predominantly female jobs more than before. And the scales are tilting. So the more'
p2956
aS'educated independent single women there are the more wonderful the world will'
p2957
aS'actually get for men, okay? So regardless of whether we one day achieve gender'
p2958
aS'equality, men are not finished. And by the way, women are not either. You have to'
