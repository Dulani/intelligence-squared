p41
aS'At the top of the cognitive pyramid, women are now a majority in our universities, graduate schools of law, business and medicine.'
p42
aS'And at the bottom, the high-paid jobs men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in factories have fallen victim to globalization.'

aS'Men are overrepresented in prisons and in the ranks of the unemployed.'
p44
aS'And underrepresented in higher education.'
p45
aS'Project these trends forward for a couple of decade, and the future looks pretty bleak for men.'
p46
aS'On the other hand, and there always is another hand in our debates, men still hold positions of overwhelming dominance as CEOs of our largest companies and financial institutions, as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes, the Microsofts, Oracles, Googles, Facebooks, as top elected officials in both the federal and state governments, as the most influential artists and writers, as scientists with breakthroughs worthy of Nobel prizes and on and on.'

p48
aS'The answer may depend on how you interpret the question.'
p49
aS"What we meant but couldn't say in three provocative words, is whether we're at a tipping point where women are likely to achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past, or whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant, perhaps, but hardly fundamental."

p201
aS'That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard.'
p202
aS'Maybe it sounds good to you guys.'
p203
aS'But what we do have to prove, and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to.'
p204
aS'We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically.'
p205
aS"I'll start with the fundamentals."
p206
aS'In 2010, for the first time ever, women became the majority of the work force.'
p207
aS'This is kind of an amazing fact.'
p208
aS'As recently as the 1980s, the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence, which many of you might remember.'
p209
aS'Now she is the majority of the work force.'
p210
aS'If you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to, law school, medical school, accounting, even business schools, you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools.'
p211
aS'And last year for the first time, women became 54 percent of all American managers.'
p212
aS'Now, how are men doing these days?'
p213
aS"They're doing very, very badly."
p214
aS'The annual income of men peaked around 1973, which is just when women started to get going.'
p215
aS"Right now, one in five men are out of work, which is the highest percentage that's ever existed."
p216
aS'When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at night, you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many, many gaps he has made over his long career, but he did not mention either of those things.'
p217
aS'What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences.'
p218
aS'Now, why is this happening?'
p219
aS'The very simple answer is college.'
p220
aS'Most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple.'
p221
aS"It's just a college degree."
p222
aS'But women, for some reason, are much better these days at getting college degrees than men.'
p223
aS'For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same.'
p224
aS'So why are women getting more college degrees?'
p225
aS"It's not that women are smarter because they're not smarter."
p226
aS'These days, men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and English.'
p227
aS'But women have something.'
p228
aS'Some sociologists call it grit, some call it engagement, some call it focus, some call it social intelligence.'
p229
aS"It's some special formula that's required for success these days, which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men."
p230
aS'And this is a very new thing.'
p231
aS'Now, I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college.'
p232
aS"But then they're going to say so what?"
p233
aS'Women are goody goodies, then they go to work, and they just flame out, and they never get anywhere else.'
p234
aS'But this is, of course, completely preposterous.'
p235
aS"For one thing, it's only been happening for about a generation and a half, and you already see the results in the economy."
p236
aS'You already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30.'
p237
aS"And that's really, really new."
p238
aS"Also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were, which is something that's brand new."
p239
aS'And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later.'
p240
aS'So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture.'
p241
aS"We've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls the omega male who's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack."
p242
aS'And so we see him in the Judd Apatow movies, we see him in the Bud Light commercials.'
p243
aS"He's sitting around, putting his feet up, drinking beers, basically not working and not sure what to do with his life, he's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college."
p244
aS'I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season.'
p245
aS"The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men, and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work, sometimes they work double shifts, their wives are working powerhouse jobs, and they're coming home to see their husbands play videogames."
p246
aS'One of the guys in the sitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot.'
p247
aS"So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days."
p248
aS"Now we're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity, the new male vanity."
p249
aS'Lose your guts, 30 red hot sex secrets.'
p250
aS"Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine, Men's Health."
p251
aS"Once upon a time men's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression."
p252
aS"The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man's adventurous free loving spirit."
p253
aS'These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity.'
p254
aS'Men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery, hair products, and waxes.'
p255
aS"If you look at the back at the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive, you'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day, he's got hair coming out of his shoulders, coming out of his thighs, he's a really big hairy man."
p256
aS'These days the men are waxing and primping more than I have ever done in my entire life, as we all became deeply familiar with, unfortunately, when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner.'
p257
aS"Now, from my opponents, you'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses, men are still inventors, how they drive the technology industry."
p258
aS'I have a few things to say to that.'
p259
aS"First of all, we're talking about a tiny percentage of men, and they're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school."
p260
aS"It's perfectly possible that we'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished."
p261
aS"You're also likely to hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top."
p262
aS"I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I'm on and my answer is always the same, duh, men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years, so of course the world doesn't flip upside- down overnight."
p263

p309
aS"One of the guys in thesitcoms, one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business uponhis granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA fromPurdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot.So this is the middle class's reflection of itself these days."

aS'How the heck did Dan Abrams, a far too old to still be single guy, not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority?'
p633
aS'Did he do it to meet women?'
p634
aS'Did he -- did he do it to pander?'
p635
aS"You know, it's always frustrating for me when I'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book."
p636
aS"I did it for both reasons, and it's worked incredibly well."
p637
aS'Now, it has not had any substantial impact on my social life, and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book, "Man Down," far more attention than it ever would have received.'
p638
aS'I made a case based on evidence and men\'s rights groups and others have attacked me, saying, "He didn\'t use the scientific method in this book.'
p639
aS'" Look, this book was, at times, a fun, tongue-in-cheek effort.'
p640
aS'So I separate it into two broad themes, chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority.'
p641
aS'Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain, or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men?'
p642
aS'I presented evidence.'
p643
aS'I presented studies, research.'
p644
aS'But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters.'
p645
aS"So let's put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important."
p646
aS'Hanna talked about women as students.'
p647
aS"They'll be better educated."
p648
aS"They'll navigate tough economies better."
p649
aS"They'll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation."
p650
aS"But I don't know."
p651
aS'What about politics, finance, taking care of the planet?'
p652
aS'These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas.'
p653
aS"Let's start with politics."
p654
aS'Women vote more, period, both in number of votes and the percentage of the population.'
p655
aS'In terms of registered voters in the year 2000, 61 percent of women voted.'
p656
aS'58 percent of men.'
p657
aS'In 2004, 65-62; 2008, with more women on the ballots, by the way, 66-62.'
p658
aS'Same thing in midterm elections in 2010.'
p659
aS'53 percent of those who voted were female.'
p660
aS'But wait, they, we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry, more men.'
p661
aS'Four out of five being elected are men.'
p662
aS'In fact, in 2010, women gained no Senate seats.'
p663
aS'And for the first time in 30 years, lost House seats.'
p664
aS'This is true for now.'
p665
aS'But once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are, it will not -- it cannot continue.'
p666
aS'Men will be if not finished, certainly marginalized, the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress.'
p667
aS'The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 women won their home districts an average of $49 million more per year than their male counterparts.'
p668
aS'Women sponsored more bills.'
p669
aS'They cosponsored many more bills.'
p670
aS'They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues.'
p671
aS'In addition, two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process, received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall.'
p672
aS'And as political leaders and police officers, for that matter -- you mentioned police officers -- women are less corruptible.'
p673
aS"Two major international studies, one at the World Bank development research group, one from Williams College analyzed data from dozens of countries' parliaments, plus a 93-country survey."
p674
aS'They took a count of corruption levels within the countries.'
p675
aS'They took a count of culture, religion, education.'
p676
aS'The results were clear.'
p677
aS'The more women legislators, the less corruption in a legislature.'
p678
aS"So what the heck's going on?"
p679
aS"Why aren't there more women?"
p680
aS'I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it all.'
p681
aS'They surveyed 2,250 people, asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior.'
p682
aS'Honesty, overwhelmingly women; intelligence, women; hard working tied; compassionate, outgoing, creative, overwhelmingly women, women, women; ambition, tied.'
p683
aS'The only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior, decisiveness.'
p684
aS'In that same study, though, only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders.'
p685
aS'Similar results when it came to newscasters.'
p686
aS'A rigorous study done, male and female news casters reading the exact same message.'
p687
aS'The participants agreed that when it came from a woman, they viewed it adds more credible.'
p688
aS'And yet when those same people were asked, are men or women news casters more credible, they said men.'
p689
aS'There is only so long men will be able to thrive, much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions.'
p690
aS'Now, finance.'
p691
aS"You don't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance."
p692
aS'2009 and 2010, Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled, "For Mother\'s Day, give her the reins to the portfolio" and "How men\'s overconfidence hurts them as investors.'
p693
aS'" Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information, buying and selling more often and losing more money.'
p694
aS'Female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent.'
p695
aS'Business Week reported that when the downturn began, funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men.'
p696
aS'Yes, women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers.'
p697
aS'Maybe they have to work harder to get there.'
p698
aS'Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game.'
p699
aS'But in the world of finance, numbers should speak for themselves.'
p700
aS'And all other things equal, anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman.'
p701
aS'Finally, new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet.'
p702
aS'They recycle more.'
p703
aS"They're more likely to be green."
p704
aS'They eat less meat.'
p705
aS'They take shorter trips.'
p706
aS'In part because they give and follow better directions than men.'
p707
aS'They take public transportation more.'
p708
aS'They are also better and safer bus drivers.'
p709
aS'They save gas by speeding less.'
p710
aS'They make more eco purchases.'
p711
aS'Heck, God has decided that men are finished.'
p712
aS'Between 1995 and 2008, 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men.'
p713
aS'So bottom line, why are women still lagging in so many areas?'
p714
aS"Three reasons: Married or unmarried, they're still primarily responsible for childcare; two, they often lack the overconfidence of men; and three, sexism."
p715
aS'When number one may not ever change for certain, number two and three will.'
p716

p859
aS"Nothing's changed."

p861

p862
aS'Men make up the largest sector of the unemployed, they are the majority of people in prison, in rehab, the majority of people who ought to be in rehab.'

aS'All of the statistics that my opponents will be citing tonight are indicative of a trend.'

aS"There is a women's movement for the simple reason that women are willing to move together more as a unit."
p881
aS'Men are rugged individualists.'
p882
aS'They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for directions.'
p883
aS"So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond our opponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that."
p884
aS'It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more action oriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role.'
p885
aS'It was still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine.'
p886
aS'Its still men who make up 90 percent of the on-the-job deaths, performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours.'
p887
aS'It was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center.'
p888
aS'And while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances, I personally am in awe of Rupert Murdochs wife.'
p889
aS'We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership.'
p890
aS'Even women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of masculinity.'
p891
aS'Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black leather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is.'
p892
aS'Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins.'
p893
aS'Yes, women are making enormous gains in education.'
p894
aS'They now earn the majority of graduate and undergraduate degrees.'
p895
aS'And I feel terrible, just terrible, for Bill Gates and Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming billionaires to finish their homework.'
p896
aS'Awful.'
p897
aS'Its so tough.'
p898
aS'It would have been much better -- It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home, stayed in school, taken on their share of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt, the majority of which now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex.'

aS'Of course, theres self-made women billionaires -- Oprah, Martha, J.K. Rowling, imaginative visions shared worldwide.'

aS"That's true."
p923
aS"Nothing's changed.Now, our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge, that women nowoutpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world's economycontinues to place greater and greater importance on education."

p941
aS"So that's the way that men are, and we need to move beyond ouropponents' assertions that there's something wrong with that.It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger, braver, or more actionoriented in times of crisis, but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role."

aS'Even [[laughter]] women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings ofmasculinity.'
p947
aS'Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing blackleather jackets, carrying a gun, bragging about how hot her spouse is.Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting downgays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins.Yes, women are making enormous gains in education.'
p948
