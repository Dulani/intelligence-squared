p449
aS'But the real question is not this one.'
p450
aS'The real question, do we have another choice?'
p451

p452
aS"Because it's possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran will have nuclear weapons."
p453
aS'So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then?'
p454
aS'What will be our policy in this case when Iran will have the weapons?'
p455

p456
aS'What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons?'
p457

p458
aS'And since, in Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game.'
p459
aS"And when I refer to Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources."
p460
aS"I don't know anything."
p461
aS'And I have to use this phrase, "according to foreign sources.'
p462

p463
aS'And the other side should know what are the rules of the game.'
p464
aS'There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it.'
p465
aS'For example, if Israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear missiles.'

p467
aS"Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources, and it, Tehran-- , it's fine and so on and so on."
p468
aS'And it should be clear for the other side what will happen.'
p469
aS'And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen.'
p470
aS"What will happen, that Iran will be destroyed, and we'll go back to the Middle Ages."
p471
aS"And I don't see any Iranian national interests that justifies this cost."
p472
aS'So I believe that we can deter them.'
p473
aS'I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality.'
p474
aS'We cannot deter these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs.'
p475
aS'And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack.'
p476
aS"But I don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent."
p477
aS"For this, we'll have to change not just the policy."
p478
aS'We have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have.'
p479
aS'And again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles.'
p480
aS'So we have second-strike capability, probably.'
p481
aS'So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers.'
p482
aS'They are not rational.'
p483
aS'They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb.'
p484
aS'And the Ayatollahs are not like this.'
p485
aS"And it seems from professional and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we'll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders."
p486
aS'We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not against Israel.'
p487
aS"It's based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the '80s, not against Israel."
p488
aS"And it's very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program."

p614
aS"Since you brought up this subject of the nature of the Iranian regime and what they believe and what they think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute."
p615
aS'What do we have in -- right now in the world?'
p616
aS"It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in the post-World War II international order."
p617
aS'We have a member state of the United Nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another member state of the United Nations.'
p618
aS'That is Israel.'
p619
aS"And they're very, very clear and consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the Islamic Republic."
p620
aS"I'll give you a couple of examples."
p621
aS"This is from the supreme leader of Iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader -- he's the guy who sets the policy."
p622
aS'Quote, this is from last February, "The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cut off.'
p623
aS'" Its feelings are echoed regularly among the Iranian, and military, and intelligence elite.'
p624
aS"I'll give you another example."
p625
aS'General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, "The fact is, is that there is no other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed.'
p626
aS'" General Hassan Firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, "The Iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel.'
p627
aS'" Finally, Mohammad Hassan Rahimian , who is a top aide to Khamenei, said in the January 2010 television interview, quote, "We have manufactured missiles that allow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust.'
p628
aS'" Mr. Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part -- -- of the Iranian regime.'
p629
aS"Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Iranian regime works to destroy individual Jews."
p630
aS'Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group, is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.'
p631
aS'The rocket that it fires periodically into Israel are Iranian manufacture.'
p632
aS'The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza very recently are Iranian rockets.'
p633
aS"Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples around the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia, in Thailand."
p634
aS"And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the current defense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities for direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina."
p635
aS"So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state."
p636
aS'You\'re dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, which begs the question, "What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safety of Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the annihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring about that annihilation?'
p637
aS'" And that\'s the question that we\'re dealing with today.'
p638
aS'Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think.'
p639
aS"The first is to -- is to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is the foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a new holocaust."
p640
aS'And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastors with execution unless they convert to Islam.'
p641
aS"And it's responsible for a quarter of the American combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within its borders."
p642
aS"But, on the other hand, no one's perfect -- -- and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American- killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible, rational, and enlightened way."
p643
aS'The second response is what I call the, for lack of a better term, the "Uncle Morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sitting in Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osama bin Laden\'s third cousin by marriage.'
p644
aS'And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Morty response is to say "You know, it\'s 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next Tuesday and we\'re all done, and we\'re finished.'
p645
aS'" The third response -- and this is what I want to get into during the course of this debate.'
p646
aS'The third response acknowledges a couple things.'
p647
aS"Is that it isn't 1938."
p648
aS'The Jewish people do not stand defenseless and naked before the world.'
p649
aS"Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that single bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East is going to have a very, very hard time surviving."
p650
aS"Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel, in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrence don't really apply in this situation."
p651
aS"I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be difficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation."
p652
aS'The first is very clear to everyone, including President Obama.'
p653
aS"The day after there's going to be -- the day after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the Middle East."
p654
aS'President Obama has warned about this.'
p655
aS"He said very explicitly that a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing."
p656
aS"So you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at each other."
p657

p659
aS'Israel cannot survive in a Middle East in which America is a defeated and weakened ally.'
p660

aS'Again, there is a real chance that an Iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the Middle East.'

p684

p685
aS'What do we have in -- rightnow in the world?'
p686
aS"It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented inthe post-World War II international order."
p687
aS'We have a member state of the UnitedNations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of anothermember state of the United Nations.'
p688
aS'That is Israel.'
p689

p692

p693
aS"I'll give you another example."
p694
aS'General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commanderof the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, "The fact is, is that there isno other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed.'
p695
aS'" General HassanFirouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, "TheIranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel.'
p696
aS'" Finally,Mohammad Hassan Rahimian , who is a top aide to Khamenei, saidin the January 2010 television interview, quote, "We have manufactured missiles thatallow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust.'
p697
aS'" Mr.Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part ---- of the Iranian regime.'
p698
aS"[[laughter]] Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have toremember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, theIranian regime works to destroy individual Jews."
p699
aS'Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group,is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.'
p700
aS'The rocket that it fires periodicallyinto Israel are Iranian manufacture.'
p701
aS'The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza veryrecently are Iranian rockets.'
p702
aS"Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examplesaround the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia,in Thailand."
p703
aS"And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the currentdefense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authoritiesfor direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina.So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewishstate."
p704
aS'You\'re dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, whichbegs the question, "What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safetyof Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks theannihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bringabout that annihilation?'
p705
aS'" And that\'s the question that we\'re dealing with today.Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think.'
p706
aS"The first is to -- isto, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is theforemost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for anew holocaust."
p707
aS'And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastorswith execution unless they convert to Islam.'
p708
aS"And it's responsible for a quarter of theAmerican combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within itsborders.But, on the other hand, no one's perfect ---- and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American- [[laughter]] killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible,rational, and enlightened way."
p709
aS'The second response is what I call the, for lack of abetter term, the "Uncle Morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sittingin Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osamabin Laden\'s third cousin by marriage.'
p710
aS'And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Mortyresponse is to say "You know, it\'s 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning nextTuesday and we\'re all done, and we\'re finished.'
p711
aS'" The third response -- and this is what Iwant to get into during the course of this debate.'
p712
aS'The third response acknowledges acouple things.'
p713
aS"Is that it isn't 1938."
p714
aS'The Jewish people do not stand defenseless andnaked before the world.'
p715
aS"Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire thatsingle bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East isgoing to have a very, very hard time surviving.Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel,in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrencedon't really apply in this situation."
p716
aS"I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to bedifficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation."
p717
aS'The first is veryclear to everyone, including President Obama.'
p718
aS"The day after there's going to be -- theday after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in theMiddle East."
p719
aS'President Obama has warned about this.'
p720
aS"He said very explicitly that anuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing."
p721
aS"Soyou're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five differentcountries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles ateach other."

p762
aS'The proposition is, can Israel livewith a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran.'
p763
aS"The answer to that question is yes.You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive."
p764
aS"In fact, technically, you don'teven think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive."
p765
aS"And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive."
p766
aS"AndJeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a goodpossibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder."
p767
aS"But -- so I mean, I think if you debate atthat level, it's pretty clear."
p768
aS"There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise willbe automatic and certain."
p769
aS"It's a question of risk."
p770
aS'And so I think in a sense, the realdebate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran.'
p771
aS'And the answer is, not if they can helpit, obviously.'
p772
aS"Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea.And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it."
p773
aS'We have a massive probablyunprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductivediplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort andcyber attacks.'
p774
aS'Now, these may work in some combination.'
p775
aS"But I'd have to acknowledgethat they may not.And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel --prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon."
p776
aS"And I think although that's not preciselywhat we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that."
p777
aS'Now, the thresholdfor saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weaponreally has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintendedconsequences.'
p778
aS'You need to look at both.In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would setthe program back by perhaps two years.'
p779
aS'That an American attack would be moreeffective and would set it back by maybe four or five years.'
p780
aS"It wouldn't prevent it, but itwould slow it down."
p781
aS'What about the unintended consequences?'
p782
aS'Well, most people areconcerned about the possibility of counter attacks.'
p783
aS'Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israelinuclear facilities, terrorist attacks.'
p784
aS'But in many ways, the more dangerous response is,first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon,for nuclear deterrence.'
p785
aS"North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks."
p786
aS"Pakistandoesn't suffer those kinds of attacks."
p787
aS'And many in the world and in Iran will comearound to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon.A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that sofar has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets,international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, andincreasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales.'
p788
aS'And as a result, Iran gains access tothe world economy.'
p789
aS'It breaks out of its isolation.'
p790
aS'And even perhaps certainly gainsaccess to sophisticated military technology.'
p791
aS"In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn'tRussia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refusedto sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others,North Korea.I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is itthat we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran."
p792
aS'And I think Jeff has prettymuch answered that question.'
p793
aS"It's not Iranian invasion."
p794
aS"It's Iranian subversion."
p795
aS"It'sIran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissidentelements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both againsttheir own regimes in many cases and against Israel."
p796
aS"So it's Iranian influence; it's Iraniancapacity for subversion."
p797
aS"It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening statesand invade Israel."
p798
aS'That is a concern.'
p799
aS"And the fear is that they would be emboldened,and they'd do more of this.But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence withthese dissident populations?"
p800
aS'Not with governments, but with dissident populations inplaces like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states.'
p801
aS'An Iran that had nuclearweapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack?'
p802
aS'Which of those twowould give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations?'
p803
aS'Ithink the answer to that is fairly clear.'
p804
aS'Now, the argument that Iran would beemboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger.'
p805
aS"But it'sfar from a certainty."
p806
aS"It's not the historic pattern."
p807
aS"You know, our major problems withthe Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons.You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons.We had nuclear weapons, they didn't."
p808
aS'China actually attacked the United States andKorea and made a two-year war with the United States and Korea.'
p809
aS"Theydidn't have nuclear weapons; we did."
p810
aS"Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't haveanymore wars."
p811
aS"Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused.Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is acertain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, NorthKorea's relations with South Korea."
p812
aS"There haven't been conflicts in either case."
p813
aS"So theargument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclearweapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they'renot engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing,you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing?"

aS"They won'thave satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemyare."

aS'"But then I want to go into something which has to do with command and control.'
p945
aS'Andthis is a very esoteric area.'
p946
aS'But in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclearweapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what\'scalled "escalation dominance," you have to have very sophisticated capabilities.When you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of theMiddle East and the paradigms which existed in the Cold War countries, you actuallydiscover that most of the key elements which were instrumental in preventing nuclearconfrontation during the Cold War do not exist in the Middle East and cannot exist forvarious reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, etcetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the deliverysystems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly torush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which preventedunintentional use.So all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region.'
