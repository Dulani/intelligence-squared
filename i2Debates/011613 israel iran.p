aS'from using those kinds of weapons. The other argument against is that the ultimate'
p67
aS'way in which Israel would be able to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is'
p68
aS"not just cyber attacks or these clandestine operations we've been reading about, but an"
p69
aS'actual attack, a bombing of their facilities, which would very likely result in a war in the'
p70

aS'whether Iran uses nuclear weapons or not, the mere possession of them changes the'

S'Good evening. Where are the results? No results yet? Anyway, can Israel live with a'
p315
aS'nuclear Iran? The short answer is yes. Any questions?'
p316
aS'Okay. But the real question is not this one. The real question, do we have another'
p317
aS"choice? And unfortunately, the answer is no. Because it's possible, despite all pressures"
p318
aS'and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran'
p319
aS'will have nuclear weapons.'
p320
aS'So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then? What will be our policy in'
p321
aS'this case when Iran will have the weapons? Unfortunately there is -- as I said, there are'
p322
aS"no public debates on this, so we don't know what they think over there about future"
p323
aS'policy. What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons?'
p324
aS'The most effective and maybe the only way to deter Iran is to abandon our ambiguity,'
p325
aS'nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence. And since, in'
p326
aS'Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game. And when I refer to'
p327
aS'Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with'
p328
aS"nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources. I don't know anything. And I have"
p329
aS'to use this phrase, "according to foreign sources."'
p330
aS'But Israel has to change its policy and to move, as I say, to nuclear deterrence -- with'
p331
aS'new rules of the game. And the other side should know what are the rules of the game.'
p332
aS'There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it. For example, if Israel will'
p333
aS'detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear'
p334
aS'missiles. And in this case, Israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or'
p335
aS'not. Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources,'
p336
aS"and it, Tehran-- , it's fine and so on and so on. And it should be clear for"
p337
aS'the other side what will happen.'
p338
aS'And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles'
p339
aS'when they know exactly what will happen. What will happen, that Iran will be'
p340
aS"destroyed, and we'll go back to the Middle Ages. And I don't see any Iranian national"
p341
aS'interests that justifies this cost. So I believe that we can deter them.'
p342
aS'I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality. We cannot deter'
p343
aS'these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs. And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then'
p344
aS'Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack.'
p345
aS"But I don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear"
p346
aS'deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or'
p347
aS"not existent. For this, we'll have to change not just the policy. We have to show and"
p348
aS'declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have. And'
p349
aS'again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear'
p350
aS'missiles. So we have second-strike capability, probably.'
p351
aS'So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say'
p352
aS'the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers. They are not rational.'
p353
aS'They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is'
p354
aS'wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was'
p355
aS'perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to'
p356
aS'drop the bomb. And the Ayatollahs are not like this. And it seems from professional'
p357
aS"and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we'll learn their way of thinking, their"
p358
aS'culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders.'
p359
aS'We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not'
p360
aS"against Israel. It's based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the"
p361
aS"'80s, not against Israel. And it's very important to understand it, what is the base of"
p362
aS'their thinking about their nuclear program. And ironically, possession of nuclear'
p363
aS'weapons may moderate the Iranian leadership, exactly what happened with the Chinese'
p364
aS"leadership in '64 when they got their nuclear weapons, and they started acting like"
p365
aS'rational state. And another example is India and Pakistan. Only 23 seconds more.'

p431
aS'not going to sit here and make believe that I would hold up Pakistan as a model of'
p432
aS'stability --'
p433
aS'-- and rational nuclear deterrence, but we can talk about that later. Since you brought'
p434
aS'up this subject of the nature of the Iranian regime and what they believe and what they'
p435
aS"think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute. What do we have in -- right"
p436
aS"now in the world? It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in"
p437
aS'the post-World War II international order. We have a member state of the United'
p438
aS'Nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another'
p439
aS"member state of the United Nations. That is Israel. And they're very, very clear and"
p440
aS"consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the Islamic Republic. I'll give you a"
p441
aS'couple of examples.'
p442
aS'This is from the supreme leader of Iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader'
p443
aS'-- he\'s the guy who sets the policy. Quote, this is from last February, "The Zionist regime'
p444
aS'is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cut'
p445
aS'off." Its feelings are echoed regularly among the Iranian, and military, and intelligence'
p446
aS"elite. I'll give you another example. General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commander"
p447
aS'of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, "The fact is, is that there is'
p448
aS'no other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed." General Hassan'
p449
aS'Firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, "The'
p450
aS'Iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel." Finally,'
p451
aS'Mohammad Hassan Rahimian , who is a top aide to Khamenei, said'
p452
aS'in the January 2010 television interview, quote, "We have manufactured missiles that'
p453
aS'allow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust." Mr.'
p454
aS'Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part --'
p455
aS'-- of the Iranian regime.'
p456
aS"Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to"
p457
aS'remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, the'
p458
aS'Iranian regime works to destroy individual Jews. Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group,'
p459
aS'is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The rocket that it fires periodically'
p460
aS'into Israel are Iranian manufacture. The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza very'
p461
aS"recently are Iranian rockets. Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples"
p462
aS'around the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia,'
p463
aS"in Thailand. And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the current"
p464
aS'defense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities'
p465
aS'for direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina.'
p466
aS"So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish"
p467
aS"state. You're dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, which"
p468
aS'begs the question, "What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safety'
p469
aS'of Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the'
p470
aS'annihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring'
p471
aS'about that annihilation?" And that\'s the question that we\'re dealing with today.'
p472
aS'Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think. The first is to -- is'
p473
aS"to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is the"
p474
aS'foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a'
p475
aS'new holocaust. And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastors'
p476
aS"with execution unless they convert to Islam. And it's responsible for a quarter of the"
p477
aS'American combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within its'
p478
aS'borders.'
p479
aS"But, on the other hand, no one's perfect --"
p480
aS"-- and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American-"
p481
aS'killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible,'
p482
aS'rational, and enlightened way. The second response is what I call the, for lack of a'
p483
aS'better term, the "Uncle Morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sitting'
p484
aS'in Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osama'
p485
aS"bin Laden's third cousin by marriage. And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Morty"
p486
aS'response is to say "You know, it\'s 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next'
p487
aS'Tuesday and we\'re all done, and we\'re finished." The third response -- and this is what I'
p488
aS'want to get into during the course of this debate. The third response acknowledges a'
p489
aS"couple things. Is that it isn't 1938. The Jewish people do not stand defenseless and"
p490
aS'naked before the world. Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that'
p491
aS"single bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East is"
p492
aS'going to have a very, very hard time surviving.'
p493
aS"Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel,"
p494
aS'in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrence'
p495
aS"don't really apply in this situation. I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be"
p496
aS'difficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation. The first is very'
p497
aS"clear to everyone, including President Obama. The day after there's going to be -- the"
p498
aS"day after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the"
p499
aS'Middle East. President Obama has warned about this. He said very explicitly that a'
p500
aS"nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing. So"
p501
aS"you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different"
p502
aS'countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at'
p503
aS"each other. That's not a recipe for stability or happiness; it's certainly not a recipe for"
p504
aS'stability for the Jewish state.'
p505
aS'Second reason: if you believe that Israel can only survive if it makes peace with its'
p506
aS'neighbors, then you will be opposed to the idea of Iran getting a nuclear bomb. Israel'
p507
aS'cannot survive in a Middle East in which America is a defeated and weakened ally.'
p508
aS"America is Israel's most important ally. If Iran trumps America, if Iran beats America by"
p509
aS'getting a nuclear weapon, it means that the Arab states that were predisposed to make'
p510
aS'peace with Israel -- and we know the peace process is . Anyway, they will'
p511
aS'align with Iran, because Iran is the winner of that conflict.'
p512
aS'The third and most obvious point is Hamas and Hezbollah, even now, periodically fire'
p513
aS'large numbers of rockets at Israeli civilians. Imagine the power that they will have when'
p514
aS'they can fire those rockets under the protection of the Iranian nuclear umbrella. Again,'
p515
aS'there is a real chance that an Iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the'
p516
aS'Middle East. Even without that conflagration, it becomes very, very hard to envision'
p517
aS'how Israel survives in the long term. Thank you very much.'

(lp547
S"Well, just to remind us what we're debating about. The proposition is, can Israel live"
p548
aS'with a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran. The answer to that question is yes.'
p549
aS"You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive. In fact, technically, you don't"
p550
aS"even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive."
p551
aS" And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive. And"
p552
aS"Jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good"
p553
aS"possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder. But -- so I mean, I think if you debate at"
p554
aS"that level, it's pretty clear. There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise will"
p555
aS"be automatic and certain. It's a question of risk. And so I think in a sense, the real"
p556
aS'debate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran. And the answer is, not if they can help'
p557
aS'it, obviously. Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea.'
p558
aS"And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it. We have a massive probably"
p559
aS'unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive'
p560
aS'diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort and'
p561
aS"cyber attacks. Now, these may work in some combination. But I'd have to acknowledge"
p562
aS'that they may not.'
p563
aS'And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel --'
p564
aS"prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. And I think although that's not precisely"
p565
aS"what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that. Now, the threshold"
p566
aS'for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon'
p567
aS'really has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended'
p568
aS'consequences. You need to look at both.'
p569
aS'In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would set'
p570
aS'the program back by perhaps two years. That an American attack would be more'
p571
aS"effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years. It wouldn't prevent it, but it"
p572
aS'would slow it down. What about the unintended consequences? Well, most people are'
p573
aS'concerned about the possibility of counter attacks. Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israeli'
p574
aS'nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks. But in many ways, the more dangerous response is,'
p575
aS'first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon,'
p576
aS"for nuclear deterrence. North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. Pakistan"
p577
aS"doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. And many in the world and in Iran will come"
p578
aS'around to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon.'
p579
aS'A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so'
p580
aS'far has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets,'
p581
aS'international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and'
p582
aS'increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales. And as a result, Iran gains access to'
p583
aS'the world economy. It breaks out of its isolation. And even perhaps certainly gains'
p584
aS"access to sophisticated military technology. In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't"
p585
aS"Russia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused"
p586
aS'to sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others,'
p587
aS'North Korea.'
p588
aS'I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it'
p589
aS'that we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran. And I think Jeff has pretty'
p590
aS"much answered that question. It's not Iranian invasion. It's Iranian subversion. It's"
p591
aS"Iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident"
p592
aS'elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against'
p593
aS"their own regimes in many cases and against Israel. So it's Iranian influence; it's Iranian"
p594
aS"capacity for subversion. It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening states"
p595
aS'and invade Israel. That is a concern. And the fear is that they would be emboldened,'
p596
aS"and they'd do more of this."
p597
aS'But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence with'
p598
aS'these dissident populations? Not with governments, but with dissident populations in'
p599
aS'places like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states. An Iran that had nuclear'
p600
aS'weapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack? Which of those two'
p601
aS'would give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations? I'
p602
aS'think the answer to that is fairly clear. Now, the argument that Iran would be'
p603
aS"emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger. But it's"
p604
aS"far from a certainty. It's not the historic pattern. You know, our major problems with"
p605
aS'the Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons.'
p606
aS'You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons.'
p607
aS"We had nuclear weapons, they didn't. China actually attacked the United States and"
p608
aS'Korea and made a two-year war with the United States and Korea. They'
p609
aS"didn't have nuclear weapons; we did. Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have"
p610
aS'anymore wars. Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused.'
p611
aS'Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a'
p612
aS"certain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, North"
p613
aS"Korea's relations with South Korea. There haven't been conflicts in either case. So the"
p614
aS"argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear"
p615
aS"weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're"
p616
aS"not engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing,"
p617
aS"you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing? And I"
p618
aS'think the answer is not much.'

(lp650
S"Thank you. First of all, I won't go into the post-fact scenarios that were brought, but"
p651
aS'suffice to say that I could offer more optimistic scenarios. When you shuffle a deck of'
p652
aS'cards, then you play a completely new game. I recall that when we took out the Iraqi'
p653
aS'reactor we thought it would delay it for three years. But it took about 10 years, and the'
p654
aS'Iraqis did not get back to the level that they were before we took out the Osirak.'
p655
aS"Now, the arguments that have brought up the rational actor model, which I've already"
p656
aS'made some remarks as a historian about and the idea that deterrence works, and the'
p657
aS'other, the Cold War paradigm can be applied. I would argue that we have to look at'
p658
aS'both of these assumptions in a completely different manner. First of all, the rational'
p659
aS'actor model. Somebody, not me, McNamara, said that Castro was a rational man,'
p660
aS'Khrushchev was a rational man, Kennedy was a rational man. And three rational men'
p661
aS'almost brought their nations into utter destruction. And that was without any -- I mean,'
p662
aS'Che Guevara said that if Cuba had to be destroyed in order to destroy capitalism, then'
p663
aS'Cuba would be thankful for that. But in other words, rational people sometimes do'
p664
aS'things, or the dynamics between rational people, rational leaders, sometimes leads to'
p665
aS'things which are not rational.'
p666
aS"The other thing is that strategic surprises have happened. I don't think there's anybody"
p667
aS'here who would debate the fact that strategic surprises have happened. And when they'
p668
aS'happen, they happen because things that hordes of analysts and pundits and journalists'
p669
aS'have said are completely impossible because it is irrational that people will act that way,'
p670
aS'but they happened. So the fact is that these surprises happen, and they reflect'
p671
aS'dynamics which were not pure game theory rational behavior. Now, the other thing is'
p672
aS'that if nuclear weapons make countries more responsible, then I would propose that'
p673
aS'the United States, which wants to reduce its nuclear arsenal, should now just divvy out'
p674
aS'all of the American nuclear weapons to the whole world, and then everybody will'
p675
aS'become very responsible, very rational, and peace on earth and goodwill towards men.'
p676
aS"Now to the Cold War paradigm. The Cold War paradigm, let's define what it was. It was"
p677
aS'bilateral. It was a paradigm which, from a certain stage, had mutually assured'
p678
aS'destruction, with each party having a second-strike capability. It was with levels of'
p679
aS'intelligence that when these -- both the United States and Soviet Union acquired that'
p680
aS'capability, the second-strike capability, they also had satellites in the sky, so they had a'
p681
aS'reasonable picture of what was going on in the silos of their respective enemies. There'
p682
aS'were mutual communications after Cuba, and there was also a perception of a taboo'
p683
aS'after Hiroshima.'
p684
aS"Now, when we're talking about a nuclear Iran, we have to understand we are talking"
p685
aS'about a poly-nuclear Middle East. The nuclear Shiite Iran is going to be perceived by the'
p686
aS'Sunni countries as something that cannot be countenanced, that they are going to have'
p687
aS'to acquire their own nuclear weapons.'
p688
aS'In a poly-nuclear Middle East where every country has a very small arsenal, they do not'
p689
aS'have mutually assured destruction. They have sort of arsenal which is "Use it or lose it.'
p690
aS"If we are attacked then we won't have a second chance. We are going to have multiple"
p691
aS"nuclear states with these small arsenals with very low levels of intelligence. They won't"
p692
aS'have satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemy'
p693
aS"are. The size of the arsenals, it's better to have a lot of bombs than a few bombs"
p694
aS'because then, of course, you have the propensity to say, "Well, if I don\'t use it now, I'
p695
aS'won\'t have a second chance."'
p696
aS'But then I want to go into something which has to do with command and control. And'
p697
aS'this is a very esoteric area. But in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclear'
p698
aS"weapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what's"
p699
aS'called "escalation dominance," you have to have very sophisticated capabilities.'
p700
aS'When you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of the'
p701
aS'Middle East and the paradigms which existed in the Cold War countries, you actually'
p702

p703
aS'confrontation during the Cold War do not exist in the Middle East and cannot exist for'
p704
aS'various reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, et'
p705
aS'cetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the delivery'
p706
aS'systems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly to'
p707
aS'rush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which prevented'
p708
aS'unintentional use.'
p709
aS"So all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region. We're talking about a"
p710
aS'possibility that not because Khamenei gets up in the morning and says, "Oh, what a'
p711
aS'lovely day, isn\'t it a great day to drop a bomb?" but that because the Iranians do a'
p712
aS"nuclear alert, the Saudis don't know whether it's directed against them. Israel sees"
p713
aS'Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and Turkey on clear alert. Everybody goes on DEFCON, and'
p714
aS'things get out of hand because none of these countries have the capability to control'
p715
aS'this spiral of escalation.'
p716
aS"Now we're talking about something which is -- even if we say it's low probability, but"
p717
aS'low probability, high consequence, and this is where we stand on that. In other words,'
p718
aS'we can say, "Oh, there\'s a 10 percent possibility that this will result in nuclear'
p719
aS'confrontation." Well, 10 percent probability of total destruction is something that you'

p747
aS'on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions'
p748
aS'from you in the audience and from me.'
p749
aS'We have two teams of two: James Dobbins and Reuven Pedatzur, who are arguing for'
p750
aS'the motion that "Israel can live with a nuclear Iran." Their argument is that, much as the'
p751
aS"U.S. learned to live with a nuclear China, Israel can do the same, and it's not desirable,"
p752
aS"they're not saying that, but they're also saying it doesn't mean that the sky is necessarily"
p753
aS"falling. They portray Iran's leaders as not crazy as is sometimes claimed. They're saying"
p754
aS'that the Iranians will not want a nuclear war any more than the Israelis. And, by the'
p755
aS'way, they say that attacking Iran to destroy its nuclear program would only strengthen'
p756
aS"Iran's influence and make it harder to contain than ever."
p757
aS'Jeffrey Goldberg and Shmuel Bar are arguing against the motion, saying the risks to'
p758
aS'Israel are unacceptable. They have not, in their statement, promoted an attack in Iran,'
p759
aS'which they point out is not the premise of the debate, but they are depicting drastic'
p760
aS'consequences for Israel if a state that hates it as much as the Iranians say they hate'
p761
aS'Israel would get its hands on a nuclear weapon.'
p762
aS'They say it would be a defeat for the good guys, it could set off an arms race in the'
p763
aS"region, nukes could reach terrorists' hands. And, bottom line, two or three bombs alone"
p764
aS"could destroy all of Israel. It's not the Cold War, folks, in that sense."
p765
aS'So those are essentially the arguments that the two sides are making. I just want to'
p766
aS'start off the questions by getting to this notion of the moderating influence of having a'
p767
aS'nuclear weapon that Reuven Pedatzur talked about. He talked about the fact that when'
p768
aS'China -- when Mao got the bomb in 1964, that he became a lot less, quote, unquote,'
p769
aS'"crazy" in that sense that he was depicted and thought of in the west; that he became a'
p770
aS'lot more sober-minded as a geopolitical thinker and strategist, because -- presumably'
p771
aS'because of the stakes. And I just want to put that to the other side and take it to Jeffrey'
p772
aS'Goldberg first. The notion that -- and you addressed it a little bit in your response, but I'
p773
aS'would just like a little bit more detail in recognizing what this argument actually is, that'
p774
aS'things did change in China at that time. So take on that question, Jeffrey Goldberg.'

p2714
aS'Kandahar when Osama Bin Laden issued his first fatwa, the first big fatwa, the fatwa'
p2715
aS'against crusaders and Jews. And I was with a bunch of people, westerners, and we'
p2716
aS'heard about this. And frankly, we laughed about it because it seemed crazy, absolutely'
p2717
aS'insane, the audacity of it. And, you know, I learned three years later that very often'

p2719
aS"it's worth paying attention to."
p2720
aS"And so on my visits to Iran, and I've been there a few times, I've talked to people in the"

p2722
aS'named Mohammed Ali Samadi who was a leader of a group called the Seekers of'
p2723
aS'Martyrdom, which actually sounds like a great name for a band, actually. But their job'
p2724
aS'at the time was to try to figure out how to kill Salman Rushdie. And -- but I talked to'
p2725

p2726
aS'are always infections and diseases in man. In the world, there is an infection called'
p2727
aS'international Jewry.'
p2728
aS'And I listened to him, and I listened to various leaders of the regime. And I have decided'
p2729
aS'to take them seriously. I think in the post 9/11 age, we have to take religious'
p2730
aS'fundamentalists who say they want to kill you seriously. I think it is possible to'
p2731

p2732
aS"I'm even more afraid of underlearning the lessons of Jewish history. I believe that the"

aS'conflict is not a guarantee that the conflict will end or will develop in a rational manner'
p2783
aS'or in a way which everybody will be happy with. In the end, history shows us that a lot'
p2784
aS"of things happened which everybody's sorry about, that it's bad for everybody."
p2785
aS'Now, you know, we talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis, et cetera. Actually, during the'
p2786
aS'Cuban Missile Crisis, all of these rational people were very, very close to Armageddon,'
p2787
aS'which was, according to the capabilities of that period. During the Cold War, there were'
p2788
aS'a number of instances where the United States and the Soviet Union, with all of their'
p2789
aS'command and control capabilities, with all of their intelligence, actually came to some'
p2790
aS'very, very dangerous points, which were avoided because the leaderships had a means'

aS"we're talking about a Middle East in which countries are falling apart, and that some"
p2795
aS'countries may acquire the nuclear weapons that they will inherit from the countries'
p2796
aS'which are disintegrating. We\'re talking about a region which is -- I call this the "Humpty'
p2797

p2798
aS'this is a very dangerous area to have nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the question is not,'

aS'"Well, can you do anything about it? If you can\'t do anything about it, live with it," but'

aS'"You have to do something about it. You\'ve got to find a way." And, believe me, there'

aS"a nuclear Iran will not be the end of the Jewish state. And I'd have to say most Israelis"
p2835
aS'agree with him. The Times of Israel published a poll last week, a poll done in the context'

aS'of their election campaign, in which they asked the Israeli populace what were the'
p2837
aS'issues that most -- that created most anxiety, what were they most worried about. Was'
p2838

aS'Iran the number two issue? No.'
p2840
aS'Actually, and perhaps rather healthily, the deterioration in relations with the'
p2841
aS'Palestinians was the number two concern. Was Iran the number three concern? No.'
