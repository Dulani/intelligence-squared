p43
aS'These include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which iscurrently in effect.'

aS'This is Economics 101.'

aS'By decreasing the cost of labor, the payrolltax holiday encourages business to do more hiring.'

aS'Another element of the plan isinfrastructure spending, putting construction labor back to work for neededimprovements to our roads, bridges, airports and the like.'
p47
aS'The plan will create 1.9million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output.'

aS'Where is acounter argument?'
p49
aS"It's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past,naively hoping for a different result this time.At nearly half a trillion dollars, the plan adds around 40 percent to the alreadystaggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year."

aS'Even accepting administrationclaims at face value, it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficitspending to put a single worker in a job for one year.'
p51
aS"Moreover, it's arguable that theextra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions thatfavor unions and discourage employers.Both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow, consumersmust have the confidence to spend, and businesses must have the confidence to investand to hire.Will the passage of President Obama's proposals restore confidence that ourgovernment is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start theeconomy?"

p203

p204

p205
aS"I'm not going to go through all of them."
p206
aS"Cece's going to go through some of her reasoning."
p207
aS'But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a recession.'
p208
aS"And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't."
p209
aS'The economy is obviously struggling.'
p210
aS'This is very obvious by looking at the job market.'
p211
aS"If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average."
p212
aS'Just for context, we need almost double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment.'
p213
aS'And unemployment is already 9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher.'
p214
aS'This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune from where we were at the start of the year.'
p215
aS"I mean, it's hard to remember back, but just think about January, February, March, April."
p216
aS'We were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs per month.'
p217
aS"And I was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects."
p218
aS'But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events.'
p219
aS"In fact, John, I say they're unpredictable, largely because I didn't predict them."
p220
aS"Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict, and even with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred, 125 billion more on gasoline this year than last."
p221
aS"And by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year."
p222
aS'So we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank.'
p223
aS"It didn't provide the juice that we were hoping for, but I think it forced all the recession, very helpful."
p224
aS'The Japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth.'
p225
aS'But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very egregious policy errors.'
p226
aS'Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate.'
p227
aS'I think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment.'
p228
aS"It's not that people are pulling back yet."
p229
aS"It's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs."
p230
aS"But they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're in."
p231
aS'I do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the odds of recession are very serious.'
p232
aS"In fact, I think they're better than even."
p233
aS'Because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth.'
p234
aS'GDP is the value of all the things that we produce.'
p235
aS"They'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost a couple percentage points."
p236
aS"The good economy, a solid economy that's growing strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint."
p237
aS"A weak economy, the economy that we're in today, I think would be pushed into recession."
p238
aS"So we've got to make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is currently."
p239
aS'Point number two, I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to date has been effective.'
p240
aS'I think it succeeded.'
p241
aS'The purpose of physical stimulus is not to provide a source of long term economic growth.'
p242
aS"It's about ending the recession."
p243
aS'In fact, the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of the Obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- a few days.'
p244
aS"The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09."
p245
aS"And by the way, in February '09 we lost 750,000 jobs."
p246
aS'The economy was in freefall.'
p247
aS'By June the economy was growing again, GDP, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the recession was over by February 2010, one year later.'
p248
aS'We were creating jobs.'
p249
aS"And over the past year and a half since February 2010, we've created well over two million jobs."
p250
aS"It's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much more serious recession."

p427
aS'That of course enables me to do the easy part and him to do the hard part.'
p428
aS'And I want to divide my part up, the macro part looking first at the theory and then at the evidence.'
p429
aS'Now Keynesians say that whenever the economys weak, the government should borrow money, spend the money, or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or fashion.'
p430
aS'The goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in peoples pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy.'
p431
aS'And that sounds very plausible.'
p432
aS'It makes sense.'
p433
aS'Were all going to have money in our pockets.'
p434
aS'Were going to go out and spend money.'
p435
aS'That has to do something good for the economy.'
p436
aS'Theres only one little problem with the theory.'
p437
aS'Where does the government get the money?'
p438
aS'Government can print money.'
p439
aS'Government can borrow money.'
p440
aS'Government can tax money.'
p441
aS'But theres no way the government can put money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the economy.'
p442
aS'And what is it that were trying to do?'
p443
aS'What is a recession?'
p444
aS'A recession means that our GDP, which used to be this much, is now this much.'
p445
aS'This by the way is a West Virginia PowerPoint slide here.'
p446
aS'What is it that we want to do?'
p447
aS'What is economic growth?'
p448
aS'Economic growth means were going to take this GDP and we want it to be higher.'
p449
aS'But what is Keynesianism?'
p450
aS'What is stimulus at least as its defined inside Washington?'
p451
aS'Stimulus inside Washington is well lets money from the economys right pocket and put it in the economys left pocket.'
p452
aS'But are we doing anything to increase this blob called GDP?'
p453
aS'No, were not.'
p454
aS'My contention is that what Keynesianism does is it redistributes national income, usually in ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become Santa Claus and buy votes, but our goal should be not to redistribute national income; we want to increase national income.'
p455
aS'We want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice, thats what economic growth is all about.'
p456
aS'Let me give you an example that I think makes this clear.'
p457
aS'This is actually a quiz.'
p458
aS'Its not like the thing where you get to vote twice.'
p459
aS'By the way, if you let them vote five times, you could rename this Chicago.'
p460
aS'Heres a little quiz that will determine whether or not youre qualified to be a member of Congress.'
p461
aS'Lets divide this room in half.'
p462
aS'Lets borrow all the money out of the pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of the room.'
p463
aS'Now heres the quiz.'
p464
aS'Raise your hand if you think theres more money in the room.'
p465
aS'Im sorry, none of you are allowed to be in Washington because you have failed your elementary test on Keynesian economics.'
p466
aS'And if you look at whats happened.'
p467
aS'If you look at the evidence for Keynesian economics, for stimulus, whatever you want to call it, what do we find?'
p468
aS'I dont think we find very good results.'
p469
aS'You can go back to the 1930s, Hoover and Roosevelt were both Keynesians.'
p470
aS'Hoover increased government spending by 47 percent in just four years, that was a period of deflation so it was actually more than 50 percent in real terms.'
p471
aS'The economy didnt do any better.'
p472
aS'Roosevelt in eight years, from 32 to 40, increased government spending by more than 100 percent.'
p473
aS'Unemployment stayed high, the economy stayed in recession.'
p474
aS'Now, let me give a little bit of humility, first, on behalf of all economists.'
p475
aS'If you ask five economists a question, youll get nine answers .'
p476
aS'We have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions.'
p477
aS'Were not very good at these things.'
p478
aS'And especially when youre looking at something like the overall macro economy.'
p479
aS'Theres trade policy, theres regulatory policy, theres labor policy, monetary policy.'
p480
aS'There are all of these different things going on in the economy, not to mention some of the exogenous factors that Mark talked about.'
p481
aS'Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, oil price shocks, you name it.'
p482
aS'And now were expecting to look at one little slice of all of these different policy levers, fiscal policy, and were supposed to make sweeping judgments about what exactly it means.'
p483
aS'Of course at best all were really doing is guessing.'
p484
aS'But if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like Hoover and Roosevelt increasing government spending, it doesnt seem to have worked.'
p485
aS'But its not just the 1930s.'
p486
aS'Gerald Ford had a Keynesian tax rebate package in the 1970s.'
p487
aS"It didn't work."
p488
aS'Japan has had, by some accounts, 16 different stimulus packages since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s.'
p489
aS"Those haven't worked."
p490
aS'Bush had a Keynesian stimulus package in 2008.'
p491
aS"It didn't work."
p492
aS'And then, of course, Obama more recently has done the same thing.'
p493
aS"And time after time after time we don't seem to be getting very good results."
p494
aS"Now, I'm not up here to make partisan points at all."
p495
aS"What I think of policies that have not worked very well, you'll notice that I've listed Republican administrations and Democratic administrations."
p496
aS'But if you ask me what should happened, if you ask me for the success story, I look at things such as the Clinton years and the Reagan years.'
p497
aS'And this should make Cecilia happy because she worked for the Clinton administration before working for the Obama administration.'
p498
aS'She did a good job her first time around.'
p499
aS'Her second time, maybe not so much.'
p500
aS"But if you look at what happened during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, and you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the Frazier Institute, economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the Heritage Foundation, their economic freedom of the world index, or the world economic forum's global competitiveness report, you will see that during the Reagan years, during the Clinton years, you had more economic liberalization, more freedom, a reduced burden of government spending."
p501
aS"And that's why I think we got better economic results during those periods."
p502
aS"Now, I'm running out of time, so let me go ahead and say something about what should happen, because obviously I'm up here trying to convince you to vote against the motion."
p503
aS'In some sense, politicians should follow the Hippocratic Oath.'
p504
aS'First, do no harm.'
p505
aS"And I do worry that when politicians, especially driven by that short- term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases, oh, we're doing something."
p506

aS'I thinkyou get many more.'
p680
aS'I was in the Clinton administration.'
p681
aS"Those were good years in the'90s."
p682
aS'I think many people might interpret those times, though as that the FederalReserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the Federal Reservewas not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetarypolicy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth.In contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a Fed that cannot do as much as itnormally can in normal times.'
p683
aS'Interest rates are near zero.'
p684
aS"It's near zero, lower bound.You can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to havemore fiscal policy."
p685
aS"But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures.I'm a labor economist."
p686
aS'I got into economics because I was worried about theunemployed, and I still am.'
p687
aS'There are 14 million workers in the United States who areunemployed.'
p688
aS'Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months.'
p689
aS"There areanother two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given uplooking."
p690
aS"And there's about nine million who are working part time, but who wouldactually like to work full time."
p691
aS"So they're working part time for economic reasons.We've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth."
p692
aS"But we've alsohad many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth.And as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small R. It's just fledgling.And as Mark pointed out I'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not farenough along."
p693
aS"Now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to posefor us going forward."
p694
aS"When workers become displaced, they do not earn -- they have,going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement."
p695
aS'It has impacton their children.'
p696
aS'Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward.'
p697
aS'It is goingto affect the earnings of their children.'
p698
aS"And look at all of the young people today whoare finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even gettingstarted into the labor force."
p699
aS'So we know that these have the potential to really holdback economic growth going forward.'
p700
aS'So yes, I support the Obama plan.'
p701
aS"I support anyplan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against anotherdouble-dip recession or having more downturn.Now look, last year, I was at the Council of Economic Advisors."
p702
aS'And things were lookinga lot better.'
p703
aS"And as a result, if you listened to the president's State of the Union, whathe proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but werereally towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation.And I believe that they are very important."
p704
aS'And we all believe that.'
p705
aS"But we don't havethe economy today that we had just six, nine months ago."
p706
aS'And therefore, I think thetime is right for Congress to act.'
p707
aS"Now, let's first talk about the pillars of what -- themajor components of this plan and what it would do."
p708
aS'So first of all, about 40 percent ofit is putting money in the hands of individuals.'
p709
aS'Okay.'
p710
aS"Some people may say, well, look,that's putting money in their pockets."
p711
aS"They're not doing much."
p712
aS"But let's talk about it."
p713
aS'Sothe tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earnedabout $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, I should say.It was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more.'
p714
aS'It continues the federallyfunded unemployment insurance benefits.'
p715
aS"Now, let's talk about that."
p716
aS'Six millionworkers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits.'
p717
aS'They lost their job throughno fault of their own.'
p718
aS'These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog.'
p719
aS"It's onlyreplacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320a week."
p720
aS"And we know that that's about a third of the family income."
p721
aS'It helps them topay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table.'
p722
aS'It helps them tosupport their local businesses, et cetera.'
p723
aS"And that's the way in which it helps to supportthe economy."
p724
aS'The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits areone of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the shortterm.'
p725
aS'Important we can talk more about this.'
p726
aS'I know many believe that this is not thetime to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits.'
p727
aS'And I would argue this is exactlythe time to do so.'
p728
aS"It also -- let's face it, the private sector is the most important sourceof job growth in this country."
p729
aS'They provide 80 percent of the jobs.So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobsprogram.'
p730
aS"It's about trying to stand up the private sector."
p731
aS'So another 20 percent or soare ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business.'
p732
aS'So I teachmicroeconomics.'
p733
aS'Firms do business by having labor and capital.'
p734
aS"I hope that's as geekyas I get tonight."
p735
aS'And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well aslowering costs of hiring workers.'
p736
aS'Again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to theemployee but to the employer now.'
p737
aS'And it also provides an extra incentive for firms tobring on more workers.'
p738
aS'And lastly, as I mentioned before -- all of those should help inthe next year.'
p739
aS"But we know we're going to be in this for a little while."
p740
aS'It takes a while torecover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector.'
p741
aS'And so 20percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually oneof the pillars of economic growth.'
p742
aS'Now, as Mark mentioned, there are someinnovations in the way some of this money would be spent.In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states toprovide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers.'
p743
aS"There is encouragingstates to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying offworkers and keeping some-- they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporarydownturn, through work sharing."
p744
aS"It encourages entrepreneurship by encouragingstates, some of which already have them, including my own state of New Jersey -- helpmaking it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start theirbusiness while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which theycurrently are not technically allowed to do."
p745
aS"And it also starts an infrastructure bankwhich is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some ofthese public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of areturn in order to do."
p746
aS"So I think that it's a balanced package, and I think it hits a lot ofthe right parts."
p747
aS"As Mark mentioned, it's paid for."
p748
aS"We can talk more about the way it'spaid for.You know, the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax onthose whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03percent of American taxpayers."
p749
aS'So, in closing, yes, I support a program that will providesupport to this economy today because I am very worried about how families aregetting by.'
p750
aS'We have 46 million families living in poverty.'
p751
aS"I'm worried that our recoveryis fragile."
p752
aS"This doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have morerobust growth going forward, but I just don't happen to believe that these aren'tmutually exclusive."

aS"If you look at the kinds of provisions that are created there, it's a massive bureaucracy which is designed to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted."
p895
aS'It is the kind of thing which says that you cannot buy from sensible foreign providers if they are expensive and inefficient American providers, then there are huge amounts of administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed.'
p896
aS'The whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program, and it will turn it into a waste.'
p897
aS"A similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of Hoover's legislation, the Davis-Bacon Act, saying that when the government gives this kind of money out, you have to pay prevailing i.e."
p898
aS'union wages with respect to the money in question.'
p899
aS'So the stimulus program seems to say, "The way in which you get the most for your money is to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can," and there\'s no way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to the legislation in question.'
p900
aS'A third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an anti-discrimination act which says that you cannot discriminate against people who are unemployed when you decide whom to hire.'
p901
aS'That of course is an extremely complicated provision.'
p902
aS'It has about four separate pages to it, and there\'s an exception which says that, "Yes, you can take into account their job record under these circumstances.'
p903
aS'" So any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running -- exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits.'
p904
aS"But of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire somebody who's already employed, that opens up a position for somebody else."
p905
aS'So what you have to understand is at these particular levels, all of the micromanagement is counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question.'
p906
aS"Then the next thing that we've heard about, and was praised mightily, was the payroll reduction tax for a single year, and what happens is we know what's wrong with this tax because we've been told so by our opponents in this case."
p907
aS'Employers are not people who are foolish.'
p908
aS"They understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run, they don't only look at this year's rates, they look at next year's rates as well."
p909
aS'Our objective with respect to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth.'
p910
aS"We cannot do that, say, to people -- hire people this year, train them for 26 weeks, and then when you get to next year, what's going to happen is you're going to go back to the higher rates of taxation."
p911
aS'People will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to achieve.'
p912
aS'You must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is going to be able to succeed.'
p913
aS'Any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed to failure.'
p914
aS'There is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion.'
p915
aS'So then the question comes, and Ill talk about this for the remainder of my time, what is it that we ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons that the Obama tax plan is doomed to failure?'
p916
aS'And it seems to me what we have to do is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic policy.'
p917
aS'So as a lawyer in particular, one of things that impresses me is at the same time we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect to macro policies, we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed.'
p918
aS'So if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question, just take for example, as one particular, the decision of the administration to chase after the Boeing company with respect to its decision to locate a plant in Columbus -- or Charleston rather, South Carolina.'
p919
aS'The net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down, an employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be faced with a government prosecution.'
p920
aS'This is not an incentive to create new plants and new jobs.'
p921
aS'In effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers, over jobs in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place.'
p922
aS'When you start looking at the other micro things, for example, in 2005, what we decided to do was to raise the minimum wages.'
p923
aS'And it seemed to be a fine thing because those were optimistic days.'
p924
aS'But if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same time that the minimum wage is moved up, whats going to happen is at the lower level youre going to find that its very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job.'
p925
aS'And the point that was already said, namely if you dont get the first job, youll not get the second and third job is in fact something which has been done.'
p926
aS'So this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the circumstances of this case.'
p927
aS'And the list can go on.'
p928
aS'The government has decided that what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board.'
p929
aS'If youre a small business trying to go in, its just a wonderful thing to note that after youve been in business for three or four weeks, all of a sudden youre hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize, youd better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands.'
p930
aS'There is no way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that youre trying to subsidize it at the top.'
p931
aS'And also there is at present, the Obama legislation which is essentially designed to create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to predicate itself upon the employment relationship.'
p932
aS'And these again are implicit taxes.'
p933
aS'So the final message that I want to leave you with is this.'
p934
aS'The way to deal with labor problems is not to talk about earthquakes; its to talk about labor markets.'
p935
aS'And the way to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances to get gains from trade, they will return to the hiring market.'
