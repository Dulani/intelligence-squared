S'Thank you very much. My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate. And'
p36
aS"tonight's concerns, obviously, Obama's jobs plan. Congress should approve Obama's"
p37
aS'jobs plan piece by piece, since the whole thing is no longer at issue in the Senate. The'
p38
aS'U.S. economy is cruelly stagnating. Unemployment is stubbornly above nine percent.'
p39
aS'And we risk a serious contraction if Europe fails to deal effectively with its own debt'
p40
aS'crisis.'
p41
aS"While we do need to address the federal government's fiscal position in the medium"
p42
aS'term, the short term need is for government to encourage jobs creation. President'
p43
aS"Obama's plan does target the short term, specifically fiscal 2012, with a variety of"
p44
aS'measures. These include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which is'
p45
aS'currently in effect. This is Economics 101. By decreasing the cost of labor, the payroll'
p46
aS'tax holiday encourages business to do more hiring. Another element of the plan is'
p47
aS'infrastructure spending, putting construction labor back to work for needed'
p48
aS'improvements to our roads, bridges, airports and the like. The plan will create 1.9'
p49
aS'million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output. Where is a'
p50
aS"counter argument? It's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past,"
p51
aS'naively hoping for a different result this time.'
p52
aS'At nearly half a trillion dollars, the plan adds around 40 percent to the already'
p53
aS'staggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year. Even accepting administration'
p54
aS'claims at face value, it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficit'
p55
aS"spending to put a single worker in a job for one year. Moreover, it's arguable that the"
p56
aS'extra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions that'
p57
aS'favor unions and discourage employers.'
p58
aS'Both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow, consumers'
p59
aS'must have the confidence to spend, and businesses must have the confidence to invest'
p60
aS'and to hire.'
p61
aS"Will the passage of President Obama's proposals restore confidence that our"
p62
aS'government is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start the'
p63
aS'economy? Or will it destroy confidence by portending higher deficits, higher taxes,'
p64
aS'higher inflation and a bigger regulatory burden in the years ahead. The decision is'
p65
aS"yours. And we've assembled here an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide."
p66

p93
aS'win. And you, our audience here at the Skirball Center, a packed house, will decide the'
p94
aS"winner. Let's meet our debaters. Arguing for this motion that Congress should pass the"
p95
aS'jobs plan piece by piece, a former economic advisor to President Obama and a professor'
p96
aS'at Princeton University, Cecilia Rouse.'
p97
aS"Her partner is one of the nation's most prominent economic forecasters, chief"
p98
aS"economist of Moody's analytics, Mark Zandi."
p99
aS'Putting the "Not" in the proposition, Congress should not pass Obama\'s jobs plan piece'
p100
aS'by piece, this team includes an influential thinker in legal academia, a professor here at'
p101
aS"New York University's school of law, Richard Epstein."
p102
aS"And his partner is a libertarian economist who focuses on tax reform and policy. He's a"
p103
aS'senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Daniel Mitchell.'
p104
aS'Now, this is the debate. One side will win, and one side will lose. And you, our live'
p105
aS'audience, will pick the winners. By the time the debate has ended, you will have been'
p106
aS'asked to vote twice, once before the debate and once again afterwards. And the team'
p107
aS"that has changed the most minds will be declared the winner. So let's now establish the"
p108
aS"baseline. We're going to go to the preliminary vote. If you go to those key pads at your"
p109
aS'seat, the way that it works, there are a lot of buttons on it. Pay attention to numbers'
p110
aS'one, two and three. If you agree at this point with this motion that Congress should'
p111
aS"pass Obama's jobs plan piece by piece, push number one. If you are against this motion,"
p112
aS'push number two.'
p113
aS'And if you are undecided, push number three. You can ignore the other keys. And if'
p114
aS'you feel that you made an error, just correct it, and the system will lock in the last vote.'
p115
aS"So as the end of the debate, we will reveal this number that we're registering now and"
p116
aS'the second number. And by that, you will pick our winner. Okay. So we go in three'
p117
aS'rounds. And round one, opening statements by each debater in turn. Our motion is,'
p118
aS'"Congress should pass Obama\'s jobs plan piece by piece." And here to argue for that'
p119
aS"motion, Mark Zandi. He is chief economist of Moody's Analytics where he directs"
p120
aS'research and consulting. He is cofounder of economy.com and the author of the book'

aS'"Financial Shock." He is also interestingly enough, Mark, I notice that on the White'

p148
aS'Thank you, John, thank you Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here. And it'
p149
aS"is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals. It's an"
p150
aS"honor to be here. I'm going to make four points in my opening remarks. Point number"
p151
aS'one is that I think there are a number of different reasons for why the Obama jobs plan'
p152
aS"should be passed. I'm not going to go through all of them. Cece's going to go through"
p153
aS'some of her reasoning. But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a'
p154
aS"recession. And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we don't. The economy is"
p155
aS'obviously struggling. This is very obvious by looking at the job market.'
p156
aS"If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months, we've been getting job"
p157
aS"growth that's close to 75,000 per month on average. Just for context, we need almost"
p158
aS'double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment. And unemployment is already'
p159
aS'9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher. This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune'
p160
aS"from where we were at the start of the year. I mean, it's hard to remember back, but"
p161
aS'just think about January, February, March, April. We were creating a couple hundred'
p162
aS"thousand jobs per month. And I was quite optimistic about the economy's prospects."
p163
aS'But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events. In fact, John, I say'
p164
aS"they're unpredictable, largely because I didn't predict them."
p165
aS'Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict, and even'
p166
aS"with the declining energy prices more recently, we're going to spend about a hundred,"
p167
aS'125 billion more on gasoline this year than last.'
p168
aS"And by the way, that's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year. So"
p169
aS"we literally took our tax cut, and we put it into our gas tank. It didn't provide the juice"
p170
aS'that we were hoping for, but I think it forced all the recession, very helpful. The'
p171
aS'Japanese quake, very hard on manufacturing, which has been a key source of growth.'
p172
aS'But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very'
p173
aS'egregious policy errors. Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate.'
p174
aS"I think that just completely eviscerated confidence, undermined sentiment. It's not that"
p175
aS"people are pulling back yet. It's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs. But"
p176
aS"they certainly have stopped hiring, and that's why we're in the predicament that we're"
p177
aS'in. I do think that if policy makers do nothing, just sit on their hands and do nothing, the'
p178
aS"odds of recession are very serious. In fact, I think they're better than even."
p179
aS'Because in current policy, under current law, there is significant fiscal restraint, meaning'
p180
aS'that given some of the tax cuts that expire, given some of the spending increases that'
p181
aS'fade away, a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth. GDP is'
p182
aS"the value of all the things that we produce. They'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP"
p183
aS"growth next year, and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government, it's almost"
p184
aS"a couple percentage points. The good economy, a solid economy that's growing"
p185
aS'strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint. A weak economy, the'
p186
aS"economy that we're in today, I think would be pushed into recession. So we've got to"
p187
aS'make some policy changes to ensure that, that fiscal drag is less significant than it is'
p188
aS'currently. Point number two, I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to'
p189
aS'date has been effective. I think it succeeded. The purpose of physical stimulus is not to'
p190
aS'provide a source of long term economic growth.'
p191
aS"It's about ending the recession. In fact, the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most"
p192
aS'people are focused on, the $850 billion package that was implemented at the start of'
p193
aS'the Obama administration, succeeded in ending the great recession just-- a few days.'
p194
aS"The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09. And by the way, in February '09"
p195
aS'we lost 750,000 jobs. The economy was in freefall. By June the economy was growing'
p196
aS'again, GDP, again, the value of all the things that we produce was increasing, the'
p197
aS'recession was over by February 2010, one year later. We were creating jobs. And over'
p198
aS"the past year and a half since February 2010, we've created well over two million jobs."
p199
aS"It's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much"
p200
aS"more serious recession. In my view, we would've suffered a depression."
p201
aS'The stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession, jump starting an'
p202
aS'economic recovery. Third point -- did I tell you how many points I was going to make?'

S"Four. The third point -- just testing, making sure you're paying attention --"
p221
aS'-- third point is that the Obama plan is pretty well structured, 450 billion over two years,'
p222
aS'250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts, another 200 billion in'
p223
aS'temporary spending increases. You know, not all of the pieces of the package are made'
p224
aS'equal. In my view, the most important element of the plan is the extension of the'
p225
aS'payroll tax holiday for workers. If we do not extend that, taxes for everyone will rise on'
p226
aS'January 1, 2012, and again, given this economy, that would be a very significant'
p227
aS'problem. There are elements of the plan that are really quite creative, some of which'
p228
aS'Cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and'
p229
aS'hire people.'
p230
aS'There are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that I think has wide'
p231
aS"bipartisan support, and there's some really creative elements with respect to"
p232
aS'infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married'
p233
aS'with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure, and the'
p234
aS'most important thing you should know, it is all paid for. This is not a deficit of finance.'
p235
aS'It will be paid for by -- at this point, the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people'
p236
aS"who make a million dollars a year. Now, that's a negative. I don't like raising taxes on"
p237
aS"anybody, but I think that's a modest negative in the context of, again, not going back"
p238
aS'into recession. And finally, point number four, this is very important, the jobs bill is only'
p239
aS'one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track. We'
p240
aS'also need long term economic policy, but we have -- Congress and the administrative'
p241
aS'have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal, and we need tax reform.'
p242
aS'So we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code, make it fairer, less complex,'
p243
aS'and put our businesses on solid ground. So this is only the start of what we need to do.'
p244
aS"It's not the end. I want to thank you very much for your kind attention. We just can't go"

aS'the SAT answer, one of these things is not like the other. But hopefully, since I am'
p302
aS'representing the Cato Institute, I want to give people a very good impression about'
p303
aS'what libertarian philosophy of left government and individual freedom is all about. And'
p304
aS'the way Richard and I are going to divide up our responsibility, Im going to look at sort'
p305
aS'of the macro issues of stimulus and Keynesianism and Obamas Jobs Act. And hes going'
p306
aS'to look at some of the nitty gritty details. That of course enables me to do the easy part'
p307
aS'and him to do the hard part. And I want to divide my part up, the macro part looking'
p308
aS'first at the theory and then at the evidence.'
p309
aS'Now Keynesians say that whenever the economys weak, the government should'
p310
aS'borrow money, spend the money, or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or'
p311
aS'fashion. The goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in peoples'
p312
aS'pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy.'
p313
aS'And that sounds very plausible. It makes sense. Were all going to have money in our'
p314
aS'pockets. Were going to go out and spend money. That has to do something good for'
p315
aS'the economy. Theres only one little problem with the theory. Where does the'
p316
aS'government get the money? Government can print money. Government can borrow'
p317
aS'money. Government can tax money. But theres no way the government can put'
p318
aS'money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the'
p319
aS'economy. And what is it that were trying to do? What is a recession? A recession'
p320
aS'means that our GDP, which used to be this much, is now this much.'
p321
aS'This by the way is a West Virginia PowerPoint slide here.'
p322
aS'What is it that we want to do? What is economic growth? Economic growth means'
p323
aS'were going to take this GDP and we want it to be higher. But what is Keynesianism?'
p324
aS'What is stimulus at least as its defined inside Washington? Stimulus inside Washington'
p325
aS'is well lets money from the economys right pocket and put it in the economys left'
p326
aS'pocket. But are we doing anything to increase this blob called GDP? No, were not. My'
p327
aS'contention is that what Keynesianism does is it redistributes national income, usually in'
p328
aS'ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become Santa Claus and buy'
p329
aS'votes, but our goal should be not to redistribute national income; we want to increase'
p330
aS'national income. We want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice, thats what'
p331
aS'economic growth is all about. Let me give you an example that I think makes this clear.'
p332
aS'This is actually a quiz. Its not like the thing where you get to vote twice. By the way, if'
p333
aS'you let them vote five times, you could rename this Chicago.'
p334
aS'Heres a little quiz that will determine whether or not youre qualified to be a member'
p335
aS'of Congress. Lets divide this room in half. Lets borrow all the money out of the'
p336
aS'pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of'
p337
aS'the room. Now heres the quiz. Raise your hand if you think theres more money in the'
p338
aS'room.'
p339
aS'Im sorry, none of you are allowed to be in Washington because you have failed your'
p340
aS'elementary test on Keynesian economics. And if you look at whats happened. If you'
p341
aS'look at the evidence for Keynesian economics, for stimulus, whatever you want to call it,'
p342
aS'what do we find? I dont think we find very good results. You can go back to the 1930s,'
p343
aS'Hoover and Roosevelt were both Keynesians. Hoover increased government spending'
p344
aS'by 47 percent in just four years, that was a period of deflation so it was actually more'
p345
aS'than 50 percent in real terms. The economy didnt do any better. Roosevelt in eight'
p346
aS'years, from 32 to 40, increased government spending by more than 100 percent.'
p347
aS'Unemployment stayed high, the economy stayed in recession. Now, let me give a little'
p348
aS'bit of humility, first, on behalf of all economists. If you ask five economists a question,'
p349
aS'youll get nine answers . We have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions.'
p350
aS'Were not very good at these things.'
p351
aS'And especially when youre looking at something like the overall macro economy.'
p352
aS'Theres trade policy, theres regulatory policy, theres labor policy, monetary policy.'
p353
aS'There are all of these different things going on in the economy, not to mention some of'
p354
aS'the exogenous factors that Mark talked about. Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, oil'
p355
aS'price shocks, you name it. And now were expecting to look at one little slice of all of'
p356
aS'these different policy levers, fiscal policy, and were supposed to make sweeping'
p357
aS'judgments about what exactly it means. Of course at best all were really doing is'
p358
aS'guessing. But if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like'
p359
aS'Hoover and Roosevelt increasing government spending, it doesnt seem to have worked.'
p360
aS'But its not just the 1930s. Gerald Ford had a Keynesian tax rebate package in the'
p361
aS"1970s. It didn't work. Japan has had, by some accounts, 16 different stimulus packages"
p362
aS"since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s. Those haven't worked. Bush"
p363
aS"had a Keynesian stimulus package in 2008. It didn't work. And then, of course, Obama"
p364
aS"more recently has done the same thing. And time after time after time we don't seem"
p365
aS"to be getting very good results. Now, I'm not up here to make partisan points at all."
p366
aS"What I think of policies that have not worked very well, you'll notice that I've listed"
p367
aS'Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. But if you ask me what'
p368
aS'should happened, if you ask me for the success story, I look at things such as the Clinton'
p369
aS'years and the Reagan years. And this should make Cecilia happy because she worked'
p370
aS'for the Clinton administration before working for the Obama administration. She did a'
p371
aS'good job her first time around. Her second time, maybe not so much.'
p372
aS'But if you look at what happened during the Reagan years and the Clinton years, and'
p373
aS'you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the Frazier Institute,'
p374
aS'economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the Heritage Foundation,'
p375
aS"their economic freedom of the world index, or the world economic forum's global"
p376
aS'competitiveness report, you will see that during the Reagan years, during the Clinton'
p377
aS'years, you had more economic liberalization, more freedom, a reduced burden of'
p378
aS"government spending. And that's why I think we got better economic results during"
p379
aS"those periods. Now, I'm running out of time, so let me go ahead and say something"
p380
aS"about what should happen, because obviously I'm up here trying to convince you to"
p381
aS'vote against the motion. In some sense, politicians should follow the Hippocratic Oath.'
p382
aS'First, do no harm. And I do worry that when politicians, especially driven by that short-'
p383
aS'term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases, oh,'
p384
aS"we're doing something. They want to show that, oh, we care. You know, what was"
p385
aS'that, the first President Bush went up to New Hampshire in \'92, message, "I care."'
p386
aS"I mean, boy, talk about an empty, vacuous statement to make. But that's how most"
p387
aS'politicians think. They really are driven by this desire to try to demonstrate to voters'
p388
aS'that they really are concerned about your best interests, when in reality, in many cases,'
p389
aS'at least part of their decision making is driven by their desire to get more votes. So I'

S'Thank you. It really is a pleasure to be here tonight. And, you know, Dan really said it'
p452
aS'right when you said you have five economists, you really only get nine opinions. I think'
p453
aS'you get many more. I was in the Clinton administration. Those were good years in the'
p454
aS"'90s. I think many people might interpret those times, though as that the Federal"
p455
aS'Reserve, because we were having a lot of economic growth, and the Federal Reserve'
p456
aS'was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero, that monetary'
p457
aS'policy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth.'
p458
aS'In contrast, what we have today is, specifically, a Fed that cannot do as much as it'
p459
aS"normally can in normal times. Interest rates are near zero. It's near zero, lower bound."
p460
aS"You can't have negative interest rates, and therefore it's an opportune time to have"
p461
aS'more fiscal policy. But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures.'
p462
aS"I'm a labor economist. I got into economics because I was worried about the"
p463
aS'unemployed, and I still am. There are 14 million workers in the United States who are'
p464
aS'unemployed. Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months. There are'
p465
aS"another two and a half million who are discouraged, meaning that they've even given up"
p466
aS"looking. And there's about nine million who are working part time, but who would"
p467
aS"actually like to work full time. So they're working part time for economic reasons."
p468
aS"We've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth. But we've also"
p469
aS'had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth.'
p470
aS"And as a result, we have a recovery, but it's a recovery with a small R. It's just fledgling."
p471
aS"And as Mark pointed out I'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far"
p472
aS"enough along. Now, there're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose"
p473
aS'for us going forward. When workers become displaced, they do not earn -- they have,'
p474
aS"going forward, for 15, 20 years, they're going to earn much less, by some estimates, 10"
p475
aS'to 15, 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement. It has impact'
p476
aS'on their children. Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward. It is going'
p477
aS'to affect the earnings of their children. And look at all of the young people today who'
p478
aS"are finishing their schooling and can't get a job, meaning they're not even getting"
p479
aS'started into the labor force. So we know that these have the potential to really hold'
p480
aS'back economic growth going forward. So yes, I support the Obama plan. I support any'
p481
aS"plan where it's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another"
p482
aS'double-dip recession or having more downturn.'
p483
aS'Now look, last year, I was at the Council of Economic Advisors. And things were looking'
p484
aS"a lot better. And as a result, if you listened to the president's State of the Union, what"
p485
aS'he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus, but were'
p486
aS'really towards the foundations of growth, in infrastructure and education, in innovation.'
p487
aS"And I believe that they are very important. And we all believe that. But we don't have"
p488
aS'the economy today that we had just six, nine months ago. And therefore, I think the'
p489
aS"time is right for Congress to act. Now, let's first talk about the pillars of what -- the"
p490
aS'major components of this plan and what it would do. So first of all, about 40 percent of'
p491
aS'it is putting money in the hands of individuals. Okay. Some people may say, well, look,'
p492
aS"that's putting money in their pockets. They're not doing much. But let's talk about it. So"
p493
aS'the tax cut was providing about $1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned'
p494
aS'about $50,000 a year, which is about what the median family earns, I should say.'
p495
aS'It was about $2,500 for those earning $80,000 or more. It continues the federally'
p496
aS"funded unemployment insurance benefits. Now, let's talk about that. Six million"
p497
aS'workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits. They lost their job through'
p498
aS"no fault of their own. These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog. It's only"
p499
aS"replacing about half of their wages, which means they're getting a check of about $320"
p500
aS"a week. And we know that that's about a third of the family income. It helps them to"
p501
aS'pay their mortgage or pay their rent, helps them put food on the table. It helps them to'
p502
aS"support their local businesses, et cetera. And that's the way in which it helps to support"
p503
aS'the economy. The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits are'
p504
aS'one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short'
p505
aS'term. Important we can talk more about this. I know many believe that this is not the'
p506
aS'time to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits. And I would argue this is exactly'
p507
aS"the time to do so. It also -- let's face it, the private sector is the most important source"
p508
aS'of job growth in this country. They provide 80 percent of the jobs.'
p509
aS'So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs'
p510
aS"program. It's about trying to stand up the private sector. So another 20 percent or so"
p511
aS'are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business. So I teach'
p512
aS"microeconomics. Firms do business by having labor and capital. I hope that's as geeky"
p513
aS'as I get tonight. And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as'
p514
aS'lowering costs of hiring workers. Again, it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the'
p515
aS'employee but to the employer now. And it also provides an extra incentive for firms to'
p516
aS'bring on more workers. And lastly, as I mentioned before -- all of those should help in'
p517
aS"the next year. But we know we're going to be in this for a little while. It takes a while to"
p518
aS'recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector. And so 20'
p519
aS'percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure, which again we think is actually one'
p520
aS'of the pillars of economic growth. Now, as Mark mentioned, there are some'
p521
aS'innovations in the way some of this money would be spent.'
p522
aS'In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit, there are some encouraging states to'
p523
aS'provide more employment, reemployment assistance to workers. There is encouraging'
p524
aS"states to stand up programs where firms don't have to choose between laying off"
p525
aS'workers and keeping some-- they can share the pain, if you will, for a temporary'
p526
aS'downturn, through work sharing. It encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging'
p527
aS'states, some of which already have them, including my own state of New Jersey -- help'
p528
aS'making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their'
p529
aS"business while they're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they"
p530
aS'currently are not technically allowed to do. And it also starts an infrastructure bank'
p531
aS'which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of'
p532
aS"these public projects for which normally the private sector doesn't receive enough of a"
p533
aS"return in order to do. So I think that it's a balanced package, and I think it hits a lot of"
p534
aS"the right parts. As Mark mentioned, it's paid for. We can talk more about the way it's"
p535
aS'paid for.'
p536
aS'You know, the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on'
p537
aS"those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars, that's about .03"
p538
aS'percent of American taxpayers. So, in closing, yes, I support a program that will provide'
p539
aS'support to this economy today because I am very worried about how families are'
p540
aS"getting by. We have 46 million families living in poverty. I'm worried that our recovery"
p541
aS"is fragile. This doesn't mean that we don't need longer term strategies to have more"
p542
aS"robust growth going forward, but I just don't happen to believe that these aren't"
p543
aS'mutually exclusive. Maybe hope springs eternal, but I think that Congress can walk and'
p544
aS'chew gum at the same time, thank you.'

p590
aS'economy and the need for something to be done. The question is how it should be'
p591
aS"done, what should be done, and why. And I'm a lawyer, and I'm with three economists,"
p592
aS'and I have at least one comparative advantage or disadvantage as the case may be, I'
p593
aS'actually spent time reading the statute to see what it says in order to figure out whether'
p594
aS'or not the pieces make any sense.'
p595
aS"And it's interesting that you can talk about this at the macro level, but it's also extremely"
p596
aS'important to talk about it at the micro level, and so let me tell you some of the pieces'
p597
aS'which I think are positively self destructive and ought never to see the light of day. One'
p598
aS'of the truly misguided features of the stimulus program of 2009 was the passage of'
p599
aS'ARRA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which instituted a whole variety of'
p600
aS'buy American provisions in the bill with respect to those funds which were to be'
p601
aS'distributed through the government to various kinds of employees. If you look at the'
p602
aS"kinds of provisions that are created there, it's a massive bureaucracy which is designed"
p603
aS'to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted. It is the kind of'
p604
aS'thing which says that you cannot buy from sensible foreign providers if they are'
p605
aS'expensive and inefficient American providers, then there are huge amounts of'
p606
aS'administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed. The'
p607
aS'whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program, and it will turn it'
p608
aS'into a waste.'
p609
aS"A similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of Hoover's legislation,"
p610
aS'the Davis-Bacon Act, saying that when the government gives this kind of money out, you'
p611
aS'have to pay prevailing i.e. union wages with respect to the money in question. So the'
p612
aS'stimulus program seems to say, "The way in which you get the most for your money is'
p613
aS'to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can," and there\'s no'
p614
aS'way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to'
p615
aS'the legislation in question. A third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an'
p616
aS'anti-discrimination act which says that you cannot discriminate against people who are'
p617
aS'unemployed when you decide whom to hire. That of course is an extremely'
p618
aS"complicated provision. It has about four separate pages to it, and there's an exception"
p619
aS'which says that, "Yes, you can take into account their job record under these'
p620
aS'circumstances." So any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to'
p621
aS'worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running --'
p622
aS'exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits.'
p623
aS'But of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire'
p624
aS"somebody who's already employed, that opens up a position for somebody else. So"
p625
aS'what you have to understand is at these particular levels, all of the micromanagement is'
p626
aS'counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question. Then the next thing'
p627
aS"that we've heard about, and was praised mightily, was the payroll reduction tax for a"
p628
aS"single year, and what happens is we know what's wrong with this tax because we've"
p629
aS'been told so by our opponents in this case. Employers are not people who are foolish.'
p630
aS"They understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run, they don't only"
p631
aS"look at this year's rates, they look at next year's rates as well. Our objective with respect"
p632
aS'to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth. We cannot do'
p633
aS'that, say, to people -- hire people this year, train them for 26 weeks, and then when you'
p634
aS"get to next year, what's going to happen is you're going to go back to the higher rates of"
p635
aS'taxation.'
p636
aS'People will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of'
p637
aS'something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to'
p638
aS'achieve. You must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is'
p639
aS'going to be able to succeed. Any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed'
p640
aS'to failure. There is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion. So then the'
p641
aS'question comes, and Ill talk about this for the remainder of my time, what is it that we'
p642
aS'ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons'
p643
aS'that the Obama tax plan is doomed to failure? And it seems to me what we have to do'
p644
aS'is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic'
p645
aS'policy. So as a lawyer in particular, one of things that impresses me is at the same time'
p646
aS'we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect'
p647
aS'to macro policies, we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy'
p648
aS'at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed.'
p649
aS'So if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question, just take for example, as'
p650
aS'one particular, the decision of the administration to chase after the Boeing company'
p651
aS'with respect to its decision to locate a plant in Columbus -- or Charleston rather, South'
p652
aS'Carolina. The net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down, an'
p653
aS'employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be'
p654
aS'faced with a government prosecution. This is not an incentive to create new plants and'
p655
aS'new jobs. In effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers, over jobs'
p656
aS'in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place. When you'
p657
aS'start looking at the other micro things, for example, in 2005, what we decided to do was'
p658
aS'to raise the minimum wages. And it seemed to be a fine thing because those were'
p659
aS'optimistic days. But if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same'
p660
aS'time that the minimum wage is moved up, whats going to happen is at the lower level'
p661
aS'youre going to find that its very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job.'
p662
aS'And the point that was already said, namely if you dont get the first job, youll not get'
p663
aS'the second and third job is in fact something which has been done.'
p664
aS'So this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the'
p665
aS'circumstances of this case. And the list can go on. The government has decided that'
p666
aS'what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie'
p667
aS'elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been'
p668
aS'filed with the National Labor Relations Board. If youre a small business trying to go in,'
p669
aS'its just a wonderful thing to note that after youve been in business for three or four'
p670
aS'weeks, all of a sudden youre hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize,'
p671
aS'youd better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands. There is no'
p672
aS'way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you'
p673
aS'keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that youre trying to subsidize it at the'
p674
aS'top.'
p675
aS'And also there is at present, the Obama legislation which is essentially designed to'
p676
aS'create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to'
p677
aS'predicate itself upon the employment relationship. And these again are implicit taxes.'
p678
aS'So the final message that I want to leave you with is this. The way to deal with labor'
p679
aS'problems is not to talk about earthquakes; its to talk about labor markets. And the way'
p680
aS'to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances'
p681
aS'to get gains from trade, they will return to the hiring market. Thank you.'

aS'They address one another. We take questions from you. Our motion is "Congress'
p702
aS'should pass Obamas jobs plan piece by piece." We have two teams of debaters. We'
p703
aS'have Cecilia Roust and Mark Zandi who are presenting the argument in favor of this'
p704
aS'motion and in favor of the jobs plan, arguing that they feel that it is absolutely critical to'
p705
aS'avoiding another recession. That workers who are not floating, who are sinking, are'
p706
aS'going to lead to no growth in the economy and if anything, a step backward, that this'
p707
aS'program at a minimum, at a minimum puts a stop in there. Arguing against them,'
p708
aS'Richard Epstein and Daniel Mitchell who argue that this is essentially another stimulus'
p709
aS'plan, that historically stimulus plans do not work and that it is rife with all kinds of'
p710
aS'bureaucratic induction of distorted enhancements that will make it difficult for'
p711
aS'businessmen simply to hire people and make decisions going forward. And therefore, if'
p712
aS'it were passed, it would never work.'
p713
aS'Thats where the two sides stand on this. And I want to start with the question to the'
p714
aS'side arguing for the motion and to Mark Zandi. With your opponents arguments very'
p715
aS'strenuously. But essentially this is a stimulus program, and I think you agree with that,'
p716
aS"and you're saying that, in your argument, that this is needed to avoid a recession. And"
p717
aS'you have argued that stimulus programs have already worked in this administration in'

S'I was going to do that. So many employers have actually been having their ads, when'
p1707
aS'they post for employment, they say, "if you are unemployed, you need not apply." We\'ll'
p1708
aS'not consider -- or you must currently have a job.'
p1709
aS'So many employers have this in statute -- or not in statute, but they have that in their'
p1710
aS'ads. And as a result, many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive'
p1711
aS'to employment growth. So, I understand that employers are being inundated with'
p1712
aS'applications and with applicants. There are over four unemployed workers for every job'
p1713
aS'opening. And employers are having to find ways to really sift through. And I also'
p1714
aS'understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire, who they think is'
p1715
aS"the best match. But let's think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest"
p1716
aS'of society, which is where I think we have a place for government intervention. First of'
p1717
aS"all, imagine you're an unemployed worker. Especially imagine you're an unemployed"
p1718
aS"worker who's been unemployed for at least six months. So you're actually bordering on"
p1719
aS'discouraged. I actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is -- you'
p1720
aS"know, marginally thinks she's not very attractive to employers. You understand that"
p1721
aS"employers are putting out these ads, you don't even try to get a job."
p1722
aS'And the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying,'
p1723
aS'from even applying for jobs. So one is I think it discourages workers from even trying to'
p1724
aS'get hired. The second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which'
p1725
aS'young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs. We'
p1726
aS'have a lot of dynamism in our labor market, and one of the problems we have right now'
p1727
aS'is actually because of the labor market, we have fewer quits than we normally would'
p1728
aS"have, and as a result, workers are staying in jobs, they're not quitting, and so they're not"
p1729
aS"going to be climbing up the career ladder. It's a negative spillover to the rest of society."

p2591
aS'structures will remain and you will fall into a recession that might be deeper than one'
p2592
aS'that you take today. So what is it that you have to do? You have to try to figure out'
p2593
aS'why it is that in the last 10 years it has been a lost decade in terms of economic growth.'
p2594
aS'And the answer is not that the stimulus program does or does not work. It is because all'
p2595
aS'on mid-level institutions are inferior to what they were at an earlier time. The labor'
p2596
aS'markets have become much more regulated. The banking industry has become much'
p2597
aS'more concentrated at this particular point. Dodd-Frank will introduce all sorts of layers'

p2602
aS'be bourn? The answer is it will be bourn today. There is no way in effect that you can'
p2603
aS'change the situation in the future if in fact you do not change the system correctly'
p2604
aS'today. Employers and everybody else in this economy has rational expectations which'
p2605
aS'dont only look at the short periods, they look at the long periods. So if we start talking'
p2606
aS'about stimulus programs which have never worked, what happens is were just going to'
p2607
aS'add another layer of uncertainty on top of the layer of regulation. And well be worse off'
p2608
aS'than we are before. The question then is, will liberalization work? And the answer is if'
p2609
aS'you engage in a systematic program of retrenchment and repeal, these things in fact will'
p2610
aS'take effect immediately and you will start to see some kind of reversal. We do have a'
p2611
aS'serious problem.'

aS"now. And so I think it's appropriate for the Congress to step in. Now, as I said from the"
p2642
aS"outset, I think one of the most important pieces of this is one that's a tax relief for"
p2643
aS'employees. I think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is'
p2644
aS'very important as well.'
p2645
aS'I just want to add to that that Congress has always extended these benefits during times'

aS'unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent. So I'
p2650
